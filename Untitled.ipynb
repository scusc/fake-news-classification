       " 'Hillary Clinton has picked up a huge endorsement, and Donald Trump isn t going to like it one bit.Movie star George Clooney professed his support of the former Secretary of State during an exclusive interview with the Guardian.Clooney, who has starred in films such as The Monuments Men, The Perfect Storm, and Tomorrowland among many others, was chatting about his newest film Hail, Caesar! when he was asked if he would ever consider running for president himself. I am a Hillary supporter,  he declared.  I am doing a fundraiser for her.  And that s a big deal considering the shindig he threw in support of President Obama in 2012 netted $12 million in one night.But Clooney also showed love for Clinton s Democratic rival Bernie Sanders. I really love Bernie Sanders, and am really glad he is in the debate. He is forcing the conversation to things that never get talked about in US politics: disparity between the rich and the poor, which is getting worse and worse every day. However, Clooney went on to say that Sanders  focus on that one issue is hurting him in the polls.When it comes to Donald Trump, Clooney is even more blunt.  He s just an opportunist. Now he s a fascist; a xenophobic fascist,  he said.Indeed, Trump s campaign has become a lightning rod for white supremacists and Neo-Nazis who believe the Republican front-runner will make America white again and give racists the absolute freedom to treat people of color and non-Christians like vermin.And this isn t the first time Trump has been labeled a fascist. Daily Show host Trevor Noah looked at the traits of fascism and revealed that Trump does, in fact, sounds and acts like the perfect fascist, which includes  a cult of action, celebrating aggressive masculinity, fear of outsiders, intense nationalism, intolerance of criticism, and resentment of national humiliation. But Clooney believes that Americans will make the right choice in November, and even quoted Winston Churchill:  You can count on Americans to do the right thing after they ve exhausted all the other possibilities. Let s just hope Americans don t make one more wrong choice before it s too late to do the right thing.Featured image: Wikimedia',\n",
       " 'Did anyone else think it was the ultimate irony that Obama came out and declared Trump to be  unfit  to be president? Here s a great piece by Jack Cashill that is a letter from Trump to Obama regarding the comment: Please read and share because THIS is the Clinton dirty laundry list to send to your Trump doubters!Jack Cashill drafts letter from Trump to Obama about his candidate .Dear President Obama:It has come to my attention that you have deemed me, Donald Trump,  unfit  to be president of the United States.Yet here you are, championing Hillary Clinton, the most conspicuously corrupt aspirant to the presidency since Aaron Burr. And I m unfit?Your candidate, as you know, was called out by FBI Director James Comey before Congress for misleading the public about sending classified documents through email, using a single device to send them, returning classified documents to the State Department and deleting work-related emails. And I m unfit?This same candidate was called out by the Washington Post just this past Sunday for lying   four Pinocchio s worth   to Fox News  Chris Wallace about Comey s comments. And I m unfit? Your candidate, as Comey strongly implied, would not be eligible for minimum security clearance were she not president. And I m unfit?In the week before the FBI  cleared  your candidate, your attorney general   Comey s boss   had a wildly inappropriate clandestine meeting with the candidate s husband. And I m unfit?Less than two weeks ago, WikiLeaks revealed that your candidate colluded with the DNC to rig the primary process against Bernie Sanders. And I m unfit?Your candidate lied to the families of those killed at Benghazi   does it get any lower than that?   telling them that that an online anti-Islam video provoked a mob to attack the U.S. mission in Benghazi. And I m unfit?To sell the lie, your candidate had the videomaker   an American citizen   imprisoned for a year. And I m unfit?As Peter Schweizer reported in his 2015 book,  Clinton Cash,   During Hillary s years of public service, the Clintons have conducted or facilitated hundreds of large transactions  with foreign governments and individuals.  Some of these transactions have put millions in their own pockets    $136.5 million to be precise. And I m unfit?According to the Washington Post, the Clintons left the White House in 2001  with an unprecedented $190,027 worth of gifts received over the last eight years.  After the Post revelation, the Clintons had to cough up $86,000 for items that were actually government property and returned $48,000 worth of furniture. And I m unfit?Leftist Christopher Hitchens said of the your candidate in his indispensable book,  No One Left to Lie To,   Like him, she is not just a liar but a lie; a phony construct of shreds and patches and hysterical, self-pitying demagogic improvisations.  And I m unfit?In 1999, to facilitate your candidate s run for the U.S. Senate in New York, President Clinton sprung 16 unrepentant Puerto Rican terrorists. Resolutions condemning the president s action were passed with a vote of 95-2 in the Senate. And I m unfit?Says Linda Tripp of your candidate,  Hillary was not only aware of Monica Lewinsky, she ensured that Monica was removed from the White House and in the end went from being a lack luster first lady with unimpressive approval numbers to wronged wife.  Of course, Hillary claimed to have known nothing about the affair. And I m unfit?By the way, your candidate s husband was impeached for lying under oath and obstructing justice. And I m unfit?After the 1994 Democratic implosion, it was your candidate who called in Dick Morris to get her husband re-elected. To fund Morris  TV campaigns, she helped orchestrate what Sen. Fred Thompson called  the most corrupt political campaign in modern history.  And I m unfit?According to the Thompson committee, your candidate and her co-conspirators  took advantage of minority groups, pulled down all the barriers that would normally be in place to keep out illegal contributions, pressured policy makers, and left themselves open to strong suspicion that they were selling not only access to high-ranking officials, but policy as well.  And I m unfit?To hoover up cash from corporate insiders, your candidate and her husband sold seats on foreign trade missions. In the process, they ruthlessly exploited the deeply compromised Commerce Secretary Ron Brown, the one African-American in the Cabinet. Although sick of being  a mother-f -ing tour guide for Hillary Clinton,  he went reluctantly to Croatia to cut a deal between the neo-fascists who ran the country and the Enron Corporation. Look it up. He never came back. And I m unfit?One major reason for the Democratic electoral collapse in 1994 was your candidate s mismanagement of a massive health care task force. Said the liberal New Yorker of the illegal decision to keep task force meetings secret,  It is hard to believe that this decision did not emanate from Hillary Clinton   it was in keeping with her natural bent. She trusted few, and secrecy was a means of maintaining control.  And I m unfit?In a 1996 New York Times op-ed titled  Blizzard of Lies,  the usually restrained William Safire famously called your candidate  a congenital liar  for her involvement in the commodity trading scandal, the obstruction of justice in the investigation of Vince Foster s death, the Whitewater affair and two grubby in-house scandals known as  Travelgate  and  Filegate.  And I m unfit? We reached out to them,  your candidate told 60 Minutes in 1992 of the women rumored to have dallied with or been assaulted by her husband. Among the women  reached out  to was Sally Perdue, who was told by a Clinton goon that if she talked to the media,  He couldn t guarantee what would happen to my pretty little legs.  And I m unfit? Hillary tried to silence me,  Juanita Broaddrick wrote of your candidate. She had reason to keep Broaddrick quiet. Her husband had raped Broaddrick in a Little Rock hotel room. And I m unfit to be president, really?I may be seriously imperfect, Mr. President, but I have never compromised the nation s secrets, sent an innocent man to prison, or enabled a rapist.As to what gives you the right to question my fitness, that I will save for another day.Via: Conservative Treehouse',\n",

       " 'Hillary is failing miserably with the young voters. In her wildest dreams, she couldn t have imagined running neck-and-neck with  a 74 year old rumpled Socialist. More importantly, she couldn t have imagined Sanders would run away with the youth vote. Bernie Sanders has endeared throngs of young voters by offering taxpayer funded  Free sh*t,  but in the last few rounds of primary votes, it appears that isn t enough, as he continues to fall behind the candidate who is under FBI investigation. It sure makes one wonder what  dirt  Hillary is holding over Obama s head, as this recent shift of allegiance to team Hillary comes as a surprise to many. It s been pretty clear for the past seven years that there is no love lost between Barack and the Clinton s.In unusually candid remarks, President Obama privately told a group of Democratic donors last Friday that Senator Bernie Sanders of Vermont was nearing the point at which his campaign against Hillary Clinton would end, and that the party must soon come together to back her.Mr. Obama acknowledged that Mrs. Clinton was perceived to have weaknesses as a candidate, and that some Democrats did not view her as authentic.But he played down the importance of authenticity, noting that President George W. Bush   whose record he ran aggressively against in 2008   was once praised for his authenticity.Mr. Obama made the remarks after reporters had left a fund-raising event in Austin, Tex., for the Democratic National Committee. The comments were described by three people in the room for the event, all of whom were granted anonymity to describe a candid moment with the president. The comments were later confirmed by a White House official.Mr. Obama chose his words carefully, and did not explicitly call on Mr. Sanders to quit the race, according to those in the room. Still, those in attendance said in interviews that they took his comments as a signal to Mr. Sanders that perpetuating his campaign, which is now an uphill climb, could only help the Republicans recapture the White House.Mr. Obama s message came at a critical juncture for Mr. Sanders, who had just upset Mrs. Clinton in the Michigan primary and has been trying to convince Democrats that his campaign is not over, despite Mrs. Clinton s formidable lead in delegates. Via: NYT sSen. Bernard Sanders  call for a political revolution has resonated with a growing segment of Democratic voters who are committed to his message   but who, party leaders fear, will walk if he s not the eventual presidential nominee.Some of those voters tell pollsters they doubt they could support Hillary Clinton, Mr. Sanders  chief competition for the party s nod, saying she s part of the very establishment the maverick Vermont senator is fighting against. Other Democrats say Mrs. Clinton would only earn their grudging support, leaving the party fearful of a catastrophic split. Via: Washington Times I don t think there s going to be a lot of change  if Clinton wins, said Cronk, 21. Like many younger voters, he s especially alarmed by income inequality, the issue that Sanders has made a centerpiece of his campaign.  The Clintons don t really stand in that position very well.Clinton s weakness with younger voters has stood out consistently this year   she lost Democratic primary voters who are aged 18 to 29 by 70 points in Iowa, 68 points in New Hampshire and 25 points on Super Tuesday, when she won seven of the 11 states in play for Democrats. Hillary s weakness with millennials has to be very worrisome for the Democratic Party,  said Simon Rosenberg, president of the New Democrat Network, a center-left advocacy group.  What you re seeing is the millennial generation has essentially seceded from the Democratic establishment. Obama s presidential campaigns showed the power of voters under 30, who gave him 2-1 support in both 2008 and 2012. In 2016, even more millennials than Baby Boomers are eligible to vote, and they make up a large share of potential voters in battleground states such as Ohio, Pennsylvania and Iowa, demographers say.For months, Clinton tried to connect with younger voters through famous supporters such as singer Katy Perry and actor Lena Dunham. She embraced the anti-police-brutality movement Black Lives Matter, spearheaded by young African-Americans, and vowed to expand President Obama s deportation relief for young people in the country illegally and their families. She promised debt-free college for all, only to be one-upped by Sanders  pledge of free college for all.Clinton has acknowledged she s fallen short, saying she has to work harder to convince young people she will help them. When an Iowa college student asked her in January why so many other youths found her dishonest, Clinton blamed decades of Republican attacks. Via: Florida Politics',\n",
       " 'Besides Trump, no one has a bigger target on his back than DNC and Hillary email leaker, Wikileaks  Julian Assange Earlier this week we learned the FBI found an additional 15,000 emails former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton failed to turn over to the State Department during their criminal investigation of her private server use. We ve known for more than a year she deleted 30,000 emails her attorneys deemed  personal business,  which many speculate included information about the relationship between her official office and the Clinton Foundation.Last month, WikiLeaks founder Julian Assange promised to release additional and damning information surrounding Clinton s personal email use and said the Democrat presidential candidate should be  worried  about what s coming.

       " 'SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - Alphabet Inc’s Google unit told U.S. election regulators in a letter seen by Reuters on Thursday that it “strongly supports” tightening rules on online political advertising as part of efforts to curtail “foreign abuse and influence” in elections. Federal lawmakers have criticized Google, Facebook Inc and Twitter Inc for not doing enough to identify and block Russian agents from buying ads on their services. U.S. authorities say the ads were intended to influence voters during the 2016 presidential election. U.S. law permits foreign entities to advertise about certain issues if they disclose such spending, but it is unlawful for them to interfere in elections. In September, the Federal Election Commission, which sets campaign finance rules, voted to consider ensuring that those disclosure rules apply to online activity. It opened a public comment period that is set to expire Monday. In the letter, Google on Thursday offered its formal response to the FEC’s deliberation.  “Now more than ever, we must work together to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse and influence in U.S. elections,” the company wrote.  The stance marks an about-face from 2010 when Google sought an affirmative exemption from a requirement that an ad should state who purchased it. The commission did not reach a consensus on the exemption at the time. Google now is calling on the commission to extend disclosure rules that apply to TV and print ads to the Web. “Google strongly supports the commission’s proposal to proceed with a rulemaking so that the commission can provide the clarity that campaigns and other political advertisers need to determine what disclaimers they are required to include.” The company, which is the world’s top seller of online ads, also asked federal regulators and lawmakers to expand restrictions on foreign participation in elections to cover content distributed and advertised on the Internet.  Ratifying such provisions could give tech companies guidance on how to treat soft influence, or content from organizations such as RT, a Russian news outlet that has drawn concerns from lawmakers for peddling propaganda on Facebook and Google’s YouTube service. In its letter, Google also reiterated plans to offer the public a database of election ads purchased through its service. In addition, the company has said information about buyers would be more accessible.  Technology news website Recode first reported the Google letter. ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A moderate Republican senator heaped praise on President Barack Obama’s U.S. Supreme Court nominee on Tuesday, bucking Senate Republican leaders who promptly dismissed her call for confirmation hearings. Susan Collins of Maine became only the second Republican senator to meet with Merrick Garland since Obama nominated the centrist appellate judge last month to fill the court vacancy left by the Feb. 13 death of Justice Antonin Scalia. The hourlong meeting came as Republican senators face mounting pressure from conservative activists to go along with Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell’s plan to block any nominee chosen by Obama. “The meeting left me more convinced than ever that the process should proceed. The next step, in my view, should be public hearings before the Judiciary Committee,” Collins told reporters. About two hours later, McConnell told reporters: “It’s safe to say there will not be hearings or votes” on Garland. McConnell and Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley have said Obama’s successor, who will be elected on Nov. 8 and take office on Jan. 20, should fill Scalia’s vacancy. The court is now split 4-4 between conservatives and liberals, meaning Scalia’s successor could influence its ideological direction for years to come. Collins called Garland “well-informed, thoughtful, impressive, extraordinarily bright and with a sensitivity” toward the roles assigned under the Constitution to the government’s executive, legislative and judicial branches. The White House said Garland would meet next week with Republican Senators Kelly Ayotte, Rob Portman, Lisa Murkowski and Jeff Flake for “courtesy visits.”  Garland met last week with Senator Mark Kirk of Illinois, who called fellow Republicans “closed-minded” for refusing to consider the nomination. Grassley has invited Garland to a breakfast meeting to explain why he will not hold hearings, a Grassley spokeswoman said on Monday. Democrats kept up their attack on Republicans for blocking Garland. Dick Durbin, the second-ranking Senate Democrat, said if McConnell stood firm, Garland would be “the first presidential nominee to the Supreme Court in history to be denied a hearing.” Flake said if a Democrat wins the presidential election, Garland should be confirmed by the Senate “in a heartbeat” during a post-election legislative session. Some Republicans are concerned that Hillary Clinton, the front-runner for the Democratic presidential nomination, would select a more liberal nominee than Garland. Flake’s fellow Republican Judiciary Committee member Lindsey Graham dismissed the idea of a “lame-duck” session to confirm Garland. Graham said Garland would not be confirmed, adding: “What’s the purpose of a hearing, just to beat him up?” ',\n",

Wednesday morning s cover reads: Nazis murdered 2.7 million Jews, gassing 6,000 a day in Auschwtiz alone FORGOTTEN BY WHITE HOUSE Here is the image of that cover via New York Daily News Twitter:Of course, The New York Daily News isn t the first to go after Spicer for these remarks. The Anne Frank Center has called on Donald Trump to fire Spicer, as has House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi. Further, this is part of a disturbing pattern of anti-Semitism from Team Trump. During the campaign he regularly retweeted white supremacists, most infamously when he tweeted a picture of Hillary Clinton over a pile of money with a Star of David that said,  Most Corrupt Candidate Ever.  This tweet caused such an uproar that House Speaker Paul Ryan was forced to speak out about it. After he was elected, Trump s White House deliberately left any mention of Jewish people out of their Holocaust Remembrance Day statement. And, of course, no one can forget that we have avowed white supremacists working in the West Wing.To that end, if this administration doesn t want to be called bigots, they need to stop acting like it. Get rid of the racists, homophobes, xenophobes, and other assorted overtly bigoted people.Don t hold your breath on that one, though. We ll have four years of this kind of stuff. The only silver lining may be that in the end, the GOP can no longer say that they don t traffic in bigotry, since it s right there in the White House for all to see, while their party is in charge.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'CARACAS (Reuters) - Members of Venezuela s government and opposition coalition failed to reach a deal in a new round of talks in the Dominican Republic on Saturday aimed at resolving the OPEC nation s protracted political crisis, but planned to meet in two weeks to try again. Various mediation efforts have failed in recent years. Foes accuse President Nicolas Maduro of exploiting dialogue to buy time, while he says the opposition prefers violence. Few Venezuelans expect further talks to yield a breakthrough, with Maduro s foes demoralized at seeing him consolidate power ahead of a likely re-election campaign in 2018. The disparate Democratic Unity coalition, which failed to dislodge Maduro in months of street protests earlier this year and then succumbed to infighting, is pressing primarily for a guarantee of free and fair voting next year.  It also wants a foreign humanitarian aid corridor to alleviate one of the worst economic crises in modern history, as well as freedom for several hundred jailed activists and respect for the opposition-led congress.   This process is difficult, heavy, hard and full of debate and confrontation,  said Julio Borges, president of the opposition-led congress, adding he hoped the two sides could come closer on Dec. 15. The government and the opposition did not compromise on any key points, according to one participant in the talks who asked to remain anonymous because he was not authorized to speak to media.  The opposition s bargaining power has been weakened by a surprising defeat in October gubernatorial elections. Furthermore, the multi-party group is divided, with more militant sectors opposing the talks they say simply buy the government more time.  However, debilitating U.S. sanctions against Maduro s government have given his administration more impetus for the talks. Maduro wants any potential deal with the opposition to include joint pressure on Washington to back off.  We said the true aid should come from putting an end to the attacks on Venezuela s economy,  said information minister and government negotiator Jorge Rodriguez, who struck a more positive tone than Borges and said his side was  deeply satisfied  with the two-day talks. There is no indication that U.S. President Donald Trump would be prepared to ease pressure on Maduro, whom he has called  a bad leader who dreams of becoming a dictator.   U.S. officials say Washington could strengthen sanctions unless Maduro enacts democratic changes. Foreign ministers from Chile, Mexico, Bolivia, Nicaragua and host Dominican Republic acted as guarantors at the talks held at the Foreign Ministry building in Santo Domingo. ',\n",
       " 'Melania Trump has proved over the past year that she is just as dishonest as her husband. Now it appears that she committed perjury by lying under oath about her nonexistent college degree.Shortly after she was busted plagiarizing her speech at the Republican National Convention, stealing an entire paragraph from Michelle Obama, it came to light that she was also full of sh*t when she claimed that she had graduated from the University of Ljubljana in Slovenia with a degree in architecture. In truth, Melania dropped out after her freshman year when she moved to the United States to pursue her modeling career, possibly under a visa that was less than legal. When the blatant lie surfaced, her website promptly pulled her bio.But now, it looks like she didn t just lie to the general public about having a degree, she also lied in court while testifying under oath, which happens to make her guilty of committing perjury.According to a report by Racked.com, the case involved her caviar skincare line, which never made it off the ground. The line was promoted on Good Morning America, her husband s show The Apprentice and on CNBC. But when all was said and done, the skin care products never became a reality. The contract for the line was trashed when Steve Hilbert, who was a personal friend, was fired from the cosmetic company she was working with, New Sunshine LLC.The situation eventually resulted in a lawsuit and Melania was asked to testify in court. She told the judge how angry and frustrated she was that she had worked so hard to promote the product line that the company ultimately never launched. And here s where it gets interesting.The attorney asked Melania various questions about her personal background and according to the transcripts, she was less than truthful. Where were you born, Mrs. Trump?  the attorney asked. I was born in Slovenia,  she answered. Would you please explain to the Judge your formal education including what schools you attended and from which you graduated?  the attorney requested. I attended and graduated from design school, from fashion and Industrial Design School and also attended, graduated from architecture degree, bachelor degree,  she testified under oath.Court transcripts of Melania Trump s testimony via Racked.com screen shot.As already established, this is a boldfaced lie because she dropped out after attending classes for only one year.Perjury is a criminal offense that is not to be taken lightly. Being convicted of perjury in a federal case can land you behind bars for up to five years and get you slapped with hefty fines. Perjury in state cases is punishable by a minimum of a year in jail. Republicans certainly can t stop screaming  perjury  when it comes to Hillary Clinton, but surely this fickle bunch will have no trouble ignoring it altogether in Melania s case.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'By now most of us know that anytime a member of the Trump campaign gets confronted about one of their leader s disgusting policies, it does not go well for them. Wednesday night s segment of The Rachel Maddow Show was no different   host Rachel Maddow grilled Trump s new campaign manager Kellyanne Conway for a solid 40 minutes.Maddow made sure to take full advantage of the fact that she had a Trump operative right in front of her, and she didn t waste a second. For six intense minutes of the interview, Maddow confronted Conway about the Republican nominee s  total and complete  Muslim ban, which he d suggested in December. Bringing up the fact that Trump had partially backtracked and flip-flopped on the idea, Maddow asked Conway if Trump still intends to enforce that policy. Conway s response was just like all of Trump s   indirect and avoidant.Conway said that Trump had  clarified  his proposal recently, but that it had also stayed the same. While many interviewers might have accepted that answer and moved on, Maddow let Conway know that this wasn t going to be that kind of interview. Maddow wouldn t let it go, and pressed her: There s a reason why we keep not moving on from this stuff. December 7, when he made this statement, it was like every political firework went off at once. Because nobody could believe he was saying, if you are from a specific religion, you re not allowed to come here. If that s no longer the case, that s a big deal. Maddow also fired off several of Trump s previous offenses such as his racist, inappropriate attacks on the Khan family and the Curiel family, stating that out of both of the responses Conway was trying to give her,  only one of them can be true : In the same way that his statement of regret, if it s meant to apply to the Khan family, the Curiel family, we can t give him credit to that, unless he tells us that he s communicated that to them. This is stuff of his own making. If you want the campaign to not be about this stuff anymore, he s the one who has to end those controversies. You re in a position of trying to defend what he said last week, and not refer to what he said in December, but only one of them can be true. Conway responded by not answering the question and accusing Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton of flip-flopping over 20 times. Conway also threw in an attack about the Clinton Foundation, accusing the former secretary of state of corruption. Maddow once again put Conway back on task,  But your own campaign is about your own candidate, right?Conway said: No. There s a choice.   yes, this campaign is about two candidates. If I can say one thing about the coverage, it s not that it s biased or slanted. It s incomplete. It s a referendum of Donald Trump, like you re going to the ballot box and it s going to be a big picture of Donald Trump with a light. You either put a black x over him, or you say yay. Maddow reminded Conway that  one candidate is planning on banning people from the United States.  When Conway accused Clinton of  hiding,   Maddow dropped this truth bomb: Not doing press conferences is one thing. But proposing a ban on people coming to the United States over a specific religion Conway said that Maddow could bring her cameras to interview The Donald himself, but it s doubtful that Trump would rise to the challenge   especially after watching Maddow destroy Conway in this interview.You can watch this segment below:Featured image is a screenshot',\n",
       " 'SEOUL (Reuters) - Several North Korean missiles were recently spotted moved from a rocket facility in the capital Pyongyang, South Korea s Korean Broadcasting System (KBS) reported late Friday amid speculation that the North was preparing to take more provocative actions. The report cited an unnamed intelligence source saying South Korean and U.S. intelligence officials detected missiles being transported away from North Korea s Missile Research and Development Facility at Sanum-dong in the northern part of Pyongyang. The report did not say when or where they had been moved. The missiles could be either intermediate range Hwasong-12 or intercontinental ballistic Hwasong-14 missiles, according to the report, though the missile facility at Sanum-dong has been dedicated to the production of intercontinental ballistic missiles. A source from South Korea s defense ministry said he could not confirm details of the report or whether there has been any unusual activities in the area mentioned. South Korean official have voiced concerns that North Korea could conduct more provocative acts near the anniversary of the founding of its communist party on Oct. 10, or possibly when China holds its Communist Party Congress on Oct. 18.     Amid heightened tensions on the Korean Peninsula, South Korea and U.S. forces recently held their first joint short range air defense training exercise in South Korea, according to a statement released by the U.S. Pacific Command on Friday. The statement did not give the date of the exercise, but said the next exercise is scheduled to take place over the next few months as the two forces become more familiar with each other s capabilities.

       " 'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Diplomatic theatrics at last week s Brussels summit revealed how European Union leaders will coax British Prime Minister Theresa May over the next two months into parting with tens of billions of euros in return for a post-Brexit trade deal. May gave away nothing hardliners in her Conservative cabinet can beat her with. She stuck to earlier vague concessions about honoring commitments and insisting a  Brexit bill , which the EU reckons at around 60 billion euros ($70 billion), must be part of a package deal on what Britain s relationship with the EU will be once it leaves in March 2019. Sticking to their own script, the other 27 states gave May until the next regular summit in eight weeks to improve an offer officials estimate at about 20 billion euros if she wants them to start discussing future trade ties. Miss that deadline and, the EU says, time will be running out for any deal. Yet between the lines of well-rehearsed arguments that have hit  deadlock  in the view of the EU negotiator, the outlines of a political fix are emerging. It may create leeway to get round an impasse that is in neither side s interest and which has left businesses fearing the legal limbo of a messy divorce. In essence, the 27 need to trust May that Britain will pay much more than is on the table but understand her difficulties in naming a figure by December, which could spark revolt at home and derail the process. In return, they seem likely to let slip more hints of what kind of future relationship she might secure. The EU position is  solid , Italian Prime Minister Paolo Gentiloni told reporters after the talks, but also  flexible . It was unrealistic, he said, to expect May to sell a precise demand for money in December. Equally, she could not expect the EU to negotiate a future trade deal without knowing roughly what outstanding items Britain would pay for. But defining those items could, Gentiloni said, be done  in the most politically manageable way possible for our British friends . Even the roughest of definitions will let commentators work out numbers. But as a senior diplomat from another major EU power put it:  We don t want to go public with a bald figure. If it s on the front page of The Sun, the whole process is dead.  Underlining a growing appreciation of May s limited room for maneuver, European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker was quoted in a German newspaper on Sunday as telling aides he found May  despondent  when they met last Monday, beset by party coup plots and asking Europeans to help her out.  Aware of her troubles, EU leaders accentuated the positive.  Reports of the deadlock ... have been exaggerated,  summit chair Donald Tusk concluded, adding that discussions with May had finally succeeded in  establishing trust and goodwill .  Tusk, a former Polish premier, echoed the EU mantra of unity among the 27 and full backing for European Commission negotiator Michel Barnier, whose team of technical experts are handling the talks with London. But he also acknowledged a nuance in his role in steering the high-level political imperatives of the leaders. That, Tusk said, meant he would be a  positive motivator  in the coming weeks to create  a more positive narrative  than what some British politicians call EU  blackmail  demands. Anxious not to worsen May s troubles at home, fellow leaders made an effort to demonstrate goodwill. German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron take a hard line on  sequencing  divorce talks before trade, but they huddled with May in amicable conversation for television cameras. The EU communique acknowledged progress on key issues, which also comprise expatriate rights and the Irish border, and instructed Barnier to begin internal EU preparations for the talks May wants on a two-year transition period after Brexit. Tusk said EU preparations would  take account of proposals presented  by  our British friends    an indication that, even without direct talks, May might be able to show her domestic audience an outline of how the EU sees future ties. Over dinner on Thursday, she appealed for help and stressed two concessions made in a speech at Florence on Sept. 22   that the 27 would not lose out financially in the current EU budget ending in 2020 and that Britain would  honor its commitments . Some were disappointed that she repeated Britain s rejection of the legal basis of much of the EU s demands, notably that it pay for EU commitments lasting beyond 2020. Macron, for one, said they were  not even half way  toward an agreement on money. But others detected a more positive tone. Luxembourg Prime Minister Xavier Bettel said May had indicated that Britain was at least  analyzing  what other parts of the bill it might pay. Merkel said she had  no doubt  a good agreement was possible. Yet there are few illusions that the Brexit plot will play out smoothly.  We ve always predicted a drama for autumn,  one EU diplomat said.  We haven t seen it yet. So maybe November.  ',\n",
       " 'On January 19, 2016, the city of Oakland, California, agreed to pay $450,000 to settle a wrongful death suit, filed by the family of Hernan Jaramillo, a 51-year-old man who was killed while being restrained by police.The Contra Costa Times obtained video of the moments before Jaramillo s death. The video shows the man repeatedly crying out for help, saying,  They re killing me!  and  I can t breathe. As one officer pressed his knee into Jaramillo s back, four others used their weight to hold the man down on the sidewalk. When Jaramillo cries out to his sister again, saying  They re killing me,  one officer responds  No-one s killing you. Before becoming unresponsive, Jaramillo again tells his sister  They know what they re doing. They re killing me. Jaramillo did not have a criminal record. Worse, he was not even accused of a crime at the time of his death.According to the family, Jaramillo s sister called police to report that her brother was being attacked by an intruder. When police arrived, they found him alone in his room.Although Jaramillo s sister insisted that he was not the intruder, police handcuffed him and led him to a waiting squad car.The officers claim that they wanted to take him in for a mental health assessment, but he  resisted  as they tried to get him into the police car. That s when they threw him to the sidewalk, compressing his body under their combined weight, until he stopped calling for help.Although Oakland police never released the footage, which was captured by one of the officers  body cameras, the video was leaked to Contra Costa Times this week. It was later published to YouTube by US Uncut.Watch the footage below.While the city of Oakland will pay $450,000 to settle the wrongful death suit filed by Jaramillo s family, the officers involved in this incident will never be held accountable.That s because the Alameda County District Attorney does not investigate in-custody deaths unless they involve officer shootings.This insane policy gives cops the green light to murder citizens, just as long as they don t use their guns to do it.The victim repeatedly told the officers that he couldn t breathe. Still they continued to press down on him, until he finally became unresponsive.At best, the officers involved in the death of Hernan Jaramillo are guilty of negligent homicide and reckless endangerment, if not deliberate murder. But the policies of the Alameda County DA s office enabled them to get away with it.Featured image credit: video screen capture via US Uncut',\n",

       " '21st Century Wire says Last April, the UN general assembly met to discuss how the world s nations can  combat the global drug problem.  It was just the latest non-event in a long line of categorical failures, led by the United States. Ever since US president Richard Nixon declared the  War on Drugs  in 1971, the international narcotics trade has grown from strength to strength, in a black global market that is now worth hundreds of billions of dollars per year. After Nixon, other US presidents tried to champion the issue, from Reagan to Clinton, Bush and Obama. Each of them presided over one epic failure after another. However, where long-term data is available, it does point to systematic failures in drug policies. A study published in the British Medical Journal in 2013 found that despite efforts to limit the supply of these drugs, since 1990 prices have fallen while the purity of the drugs has increased. The trends were similar in the US and in Europe. The authors  conclusion was clear:  These findings suggest that expanding efforts at controlling the global illegal drug market through law enforcement are failing.  (The Guardian)As a direct result of the policies of western governments led by the US, and their corrupt accomplices in the international banking, UN and NGO sectors  in 2017, cheaper, newer and more deadly drugs continue to ruin families and communities, and millions of lives in the new western underclass and youth population Zero HedgeThe opioid crisis that is ravaging urban and suburban communities across the US claimed an unprecedented 59,000 lives last year, according to preliminary data gathered by the New York Times. If accurate, that s equivalent to a roughly 19% increase over the approximately 52,000 overdose deaths recorded in 2015, the NYT reported last year.Overdoses, made increasingly common by the introduction of fentanyl and other powerful synthetic opioids into the heroin supply, are now the leading cause of death for Americans under 50. And all evidence suggests the problem has continued to worsen in 2017. One coroner in Western Pennsylvania told a local newspaper that his office is literally running out of room to store the bodies, and that it was recently forced to buy a larger freezer.The initial data points to large increases in these types of deaths in states along the East Coast, particularly Maryland, Florida, Pennsylvania and Maine. In Ohio, which filed a lawsuit last week accusing five drug companies of abetting the opioid epidemic, the Times estimated that overdose deaths increased by more than 25 percent in 2016.In some Ohio counties, deaths from heroin have virtually disappeared. Instead, the primary culprit is fentanyl or one of its many analogues. In Montgomery County, home to Dayton, of the 100 drug overdose deaths recorded in January and February, only three people tested positive for heroin; 97 tested positive for fentanyl or another analogue.In some states in the western half of the US, data suggest deaths may have leveled off for the time being   or even begun to decline. Experts believe that the heroin supply west of the Mississippi River, traditionally dominated by a variant of the drug known as black tar which is smuggled over the border from Mexico, isn t as easily adulterated with lethal analogues as the powder that s common on the East Coast Continue this story at Zero HedgeREAD MORE WAR ON DRUGS NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire War on Drugs FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump said a U.S. jobs report on Friday that showed the weakest hiring in more than five years proved that Democratic economic policies are pushing the country in the wrong direction. The report gave Trump his biggest opening yet to target Democratic rival Hillary Clinton on the economy, after months of mostly solid economic indicators. “It’s going the wrong way folks. They’ve been kidding themselves, they’re playing games. It’s going the wrong way,” Trump told a rally in Redding, California. Clinton, the front-runner to be the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has credited President Barack Obama for reviving the U.S. economy after the 2008 recession but has also said that the recovery is not over. In a CNN interview, Clinton acknowledged the figures were “disappointing to anybody.” “I think President Obama inherited a terrible situation and I’ve said that repeatedly over the past year and we’ve come a long way out of the ditch we were dropped into by failed Republican policies,” Clinton told CNN’s Jake Tapper. The unemployment rate in May fell three-tenths of a percentage point to 4.7 percent, the lowest level since November 2007, but that was in part due to people dropping out of the labor force. Overall, nonfarm payrolls increased by only 38,000 jobs in May.  If disappointing jobs reports continue, Trump could use Clinton’s pledge to build on Obama’s work against her to woo working-class voters in states such as Ohio. The state has lost well-paying manufacturing jobs and is also a key presidential battleground - closely competitive because it does not lean heavily Republican or Democratic. Clinton, a former secretary of state, is likely to finally clinch the Democratic nomination over challenger Bernie Sanders on Tuesday when six states hold nominating contests. One is California, the most populous U.S. state, with the most Democratic delegates of any other state and where both candidates have been campaigning heavily. In a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Friday, some 46 percent of likely voters said they supported Clinton, while 35 percent said they supported Trump, and another 19 percent said they would not support either. The survey of 1,421 people was conducted between May 30 and June 3. Trump, a real estate developer, has already sewn up the Republican nomination. In the general election campaign, job creation plans are expected to be a priority, particularly in states that have been hit hard by manufacturing-sector job losses.  Trump has promised to toss out international trade deals to revive U.S. manufacturing and sweep away a slew of environmental regulations to bolster the ailing energy sector.  Job creation in the manufacturing and construction sectors fell sharply in May, according to Friday’s jobs report.  Trump has already begun working economic numbers into his stump speeches. He has said he could put 15 states that have voted for Democratic presidents in recent elections in play, including Pennsylvania, Ohio and Michigan, which have all lost manufacturing-sector jobs. Peter Morici, a conservative economist and professor in the business school at the University of Maryland, said the poor jobs numbers reflected trends that have driven voter frustration and fueled the populist campaigns of both Trump and Sanders.  He said Trump needed to add detail to his economic policies, such as detailing changes to social programs like Medicaid, which provides healthcare for the poor. “We can’t just turn around and cut income taxes without doing something about those things,” Morici said. Republican strategists agreed that Friday’s jobs report created an opportunity for Trump to differentiate his policies from Obama’s or Clinton’s. “It allows Donald Trump to tout how he would do things differently as president and focus on some of the job-creation plans that he has,” Republican strategist Ron Bonjean said, adding it would also allow Trump to talk about his record as a businessman.     Trump has been fleshing out his foreign policy ideas and has released a tax plan, but he has been light on other details, such as how he would oversee the U.S. financial system. ',\n",

The federal hiring freeze imposed shortly after Trump entered office will be lifted on Wednesday, but agencies will be asked to remain mindful of Trump’s goal to reduce the federal workforce, Mulvaney said during a briefing. Mulvaney acknowledged that the president’s budget would have to be approved by the Republican-controlled Congress, where lawmakers from both parties have balked at some of the drastic reductions. “One of the reasons this is so difficult to do is you just can’t wave a magic wand in the Oval Office and do these things,” Mulvaney said. “There will be certain things for which we will need legislative authority.”     In the bare bones budget issued last month, the White House did not offer many specific details on how the budget cuts would be achieved. Mulvaney will ask departments to fill in some of those blanks. Preliminary plans are due from departments in June, with the final versions expected in September. Not every department gets a cut under Trump’s plan. Mulvaney stressed that some agencies including the Department of Defense and Veterans Affairs department will be able to beef up their workforce.

       " 'Here s what Politico s headline today looked like:Here s what the leftist anti-American rag Politico had to say about Angela Merkel s visit to the US to meet with our new President Donald Trump: This time the media hype surrounding a White House meeting is no wild exaggeration. When President Donald Trump and German Chancellor Angela Merkel finally get together on Friday, the leaders of the West s two most powerful countries are sure to come off more like an odd couple than two close allies chewing over plans for some joint enterprise. And for good reason. Merkel and Trump are not only polar opposites as people, but they share little in terms of international outlook.Their styles reflect their vastly different backgrounds. Merkel, Germany s first and only female chancellor, was raised by a pastor in communist East Germany, where she earned a doctorate in physical chemistry. Although she is the longest-serving and most powerful leader in Europe, she is unfailingly modest, competent and consensus-oriented. Trump s all-about-me mentality, Queens upbringing and brash, tabloid-and-reality-TV personality couldn t be more different. Could one even imagine the outrage if a piece like this was published about Barack Obama within his first 60 days in office? The mentality of the unhinged left is on display for every American to see and if they keep this up, even for a few more months, they will never win another election. Here s how Nigel Farage, the British rock star who was behind  Brexit  feels about Merkel s visit to the White House:  https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EqnCkSYLDgQ',\n",

He s not satirizing anyone. On purpose. During the address, Trump got a taste of his own medicine by a pair of comedians who infiltrated the auditorium and hectored Trump from the crowd.In addition to pretending to support Trump, Jason Selvig and Davram Stiefler began to get restless, eventually shouting  Boring!  and  We re bored! We came here to be entertained!  at the presumptive Republican nominee. Naturally, Trump can dish it out but he can t take it so, reacting to the comedians, Trump gestured to his security and muttered,  Get  em outta here. If only we could do the same to Trump.So, like so many others before him, the comedians were escorted out of the room. Of course, this brings up yet another example of Trump being incapable of personally dealing with someone he doesn t like, while simultaneously expecting us to believe he can stand up to Putin and ISIS.Frankly, after Obama pledged to lead an effort to cure cancer, I m shocked Trump didn t come out against curing cancer.[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rDML9Cfuw-0&w=560&h=315]Featured image via video screen grab.',\n",
       " 'HAVANA (Reuters) - Saul Berenthal has waited for decades for a chance to do business in Cuba. Despite the astonishing breakthroughs in U.S.-Cuban relations under President Barack Obama, he must wait some more. Berenthal and business partner Horace Clemmons of Alabama are close to becoming the first U.S. businessmen to manufacture in Cuba with a plan to build low-cost tractors designed for Cuban farms, largely run by private cooperatives. Their project has U.S. approval and Cuba’s Communist  government has given positive signals about the proposed plant but has yet to bestow permission. “It’s a little bit of a test of loyalty. Are we willing to go through obstacles to achieve what we believe is a good thing for the Cubans and ourselves?” said Berenthal, who was born in Cuba in 1944 and left for the United States as a student in 1960, a year after Fidel Castro’s revolution. After more than half a century of antagonism between the two countries, Obama has redefined relations with Cuba in the last 15 months, and Cuba is changing. But its leaders are wary of moving too quickly. “What is perceived on the outside as slow progress is really the way of Cubans assuring themselves of the trust that is necessary to be built,” Berenthal said. Obama arrives in Havana on Sunday for a historic visit that seals a rapprochement he and Cuban President Raul Castro agreed in December 2014 after 18 months of secret negotiations. Since then, Havana has changed noticeably. The number of U.S. visitors soared 77 percent in 2015, swarming hotels and restaurants that have been booked to capacity.  Obama this week issued sweeping regulations to promote even more U.S. travel and trade to Cuba. It was the fifth time he has used executive powers to boost ties with Cuba, sidestepping the Republican-controlled Congress which has refused to lift a 54-year-old economic embargo against the island. Cuba’s government has yet to fully reciprocate. Cuba did agree to roaming deals with U.S. telecommunications operators and restoring scheduled commercial airline service, two deals that bring more revenue to the government. When it comes to Obama’s overtures to the Cuba’s small but growing private sector, however, the government has been more deliberate. It has yet to accept U.S. sales of farming equipment and construction materials to private businesses, which were authorized by Obama.  Market-style reforms, introduced by Raul Castro in 2011 to “update” Cuba’s socialist model, have been implemented haltingly, even reversed in some areas. The government recently attempted restoring price controls on fresh food markets in Havana. Many traits of communism remain. Political dissent is  repressed, commercial property cannot be bought and sold and the government still controls imports and exports.  There is no wholesale market for most private enterprises, forcing shopkeepers to buy inventory at state retail prices or resort to trickery or the black market.  “Cuba has already changed, but needs more,” said Niuris Higueras, owner of the Atelier restaurant, one of the trendiest spots in Havana’s dining scene. She said business grew 50 percent over the past year. “We need to link up with the U.S. market,” Higueras said. “There needs to be more access to U.S. products here in Cuba. We need Home Depot, a Walmart, a Costco. A Restaurant Depot would be fabulous.” While the ice has been broken on commerce, Castro insists there will be no change to one-party rule.    U.S.-backed dissidents are still detained for attempting  unauthorized political demonstrations and opponents of Obama’s opening to Cuba say he has rewarded Castro without receiving concessions in return. The White House counters that helping stimulate a vibrant private sector is good for ordinary Cubans and offers a more promising path toward political change than the decades-old policy of isolation. While the date of Dec. 17, 2014, marks the most significant turning point in U.S.-Cuban relations, the Obama policy that has so far had most impact on the lives of ordinary Cubans was implemented in 2009, just three months into his presidency. It was then he ordered the lifting of travel restrictions on Cuban-Americans visiting relatives in Cuba and the removal of limits on remittances to relatives on the island. Cuban-Americans can now come and go freely and send as much money as they want to their families. That has financed a boom in small businesses and home repairs and jolted the nascent real estate market. Castro’s own reforms have also helped grow the private sector. Today some 500,000 Cubans, or 10 percent of the workforce, are registered to work in private businesses, including restaurants, car repair workshops, homes rented out to tourists, beauty parlors and English language schools. Some 70 percent of the 1-million-strong agricultural workforce is private with many Cubans working on state farms that have converted into cooperatives and owning equal stakes in the business.   John Kavulich, president of the U.S.-Cuba Trade and Economic Council, which has been tracking Cuba for more than 20 years, says the changes have lifted expectations, especially inside the budding middle-class.  “There is now additional pressure from within for structural changes to the ideological foundation of the country. Cuba must do more than reform the commercial and economic sectors of the country. It must aggressively redefine the revolution,” Kavulich said. While Cuban dissidents and Obama’s critics at home prioritize the issue of human rights, others are more concerned about economic growth and better living conditions. “No one is talking about the visit in terms of democracy, human rights or the opposition. There is still no culture around freedom of expression,” Anaida Gonzalez, a retired nurse in central Camaguey province, said in a telephone interview. “People have too many problems in their daily lives. What they want is for their lives to improve and they associate that with the embargo,” she said.    Most Cubans live on state salaries that average $25 a month plus a monthly ration card that provides about a week’s worth of food and household supplies. “It would be a mistake to assume most Cubans prioritize political questions and are scared to express themselves,” said Carlos Alzugaray, a retired Cuban diplomat and professor specializing in U.S.-Cuban relations. “They hope to live better. Change, political and economic, is coming to Cuba anyway, but on our own terms.” ',\n",

I had carefully planned it so that no one would get hurt, including me especially me. I thought about being 75 years old and watching the collapse of this country, and thinking that I had an idea that might have arrested the fall  and didn t do it. And I will tell you, completely honestly that I d rather die in the flight than live to be 80 years old and see this country fall. The wife of a Florida man who was arrested after he landed a one-man gyrocopter on the west lawn of the U.S. Capitol building to protest money in politics insists that her husband is a patriot.While she says that she was not aware that her husband was going to attempt the illegal flight to Washington, Alena Hughes nonetheless believes that her husband is a  patriot  who  loves his country. I think he s a patriot and I m proud of him,  Mrs. Hughes told the media.Still, the whole incident has been  stressful,  Alena said.Doug Hughes, 61, a post office employee from Tampa Bay, Florida, told Capitol police that his gyrocopter mission was to highlight  money in politics  and he intended to deliver a letter to each member of Congress to urge them to initiate campaign finance reform.Since his arrest, the 61-year-old also claimed that the 2012 suicide of his son, John Joseph, also motivated him to make his protest flight.Hughes hired an attorney in Washington, but Mrs. Hughes also hired Paul Carr, her own attorney, just in case.Mrs. Hughes  attorney had an interesting take on Mr. Hughes  actions.

       " 'BUDAPEST (Reuters) - The United States said on Monday it would fund rural media outlets in Hungary to help train and equip journalists in defense of an independent media it sees subject to growing pressure and intimidation. Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban has increased media control by legal changes, regulatory steps and takeovers of outlets by business sector associates. The moves have alarmed Western partners with the approach of elections, due in April 2018, which he is widely expected to win comfortably. The trend was especially strong in rural Hungary, where government-controlled public media and a handful of outlets friendly to the ruling Fidesz party are the only news sources most people get. That is where the $700,000 U.S. program focuses.  The Department of State... seeks a partner for the United States Government who will help educate journalists and aspiring journalists on how to practise their trade,  a State Department official said in a statement emailed to Reuters.  The United States has publicly and privately expressed our concerns about the status of the free press in Hungary on multiple occasions,  the official said.  Hungary has committed to upholding these standards.  The government had no immediate comment. The program offers technical and financial assistance to media outlets, as well as increased local and international exposure, small grants and other tools. They can use the funds after May 2018. Washington denied entry to top officials of his government on corruption charges in 2014, and Orban ruffled feathers with attacks on the U.S.-chartered Central European University, an issue yet to be resolved. The U.S. Bureau of Democracy, Human Rights and Labor launched the program after the top U.S. diplomat in Budapest cited an erosion of media freedoms.  There are still independent and opposition media outlets here that are able to practise journalism with broad editorial freedom,  Charg  d Affaires David Kostelancik said last month at a journalism conference.  That is a good thing.   However, their numbers are dwindling, and they face challenges in the advertising market that the pro-government outlets do not. They face pressure and intimidation... as a result, fewer and fewer Hungarians are exposed to the robust debate and discussion that is so important   in fact fundamental   to a representative democracy.  Foreign Ministry State Secretary Levente Magyar, reacting to those comments, said the government would  continue to reject all statements that affect Hungarian internal affairs and are based on misrepresentation in the strongest possible terms . The Organisation for Security and Cooperation in Europe, an intergovernmental human rights and media freedom watchdog, has said media pluralism has declined in Hungary. ',\n",
       " 'Republican lawmakers love using the Bible to dictate their policies. They especially love using it to justify pushing spending cuts to social programs   even if it means intentionally misreading their favorite passages.In Texas, Rep. Jodey Arrington decided his support for cutting parts of the Supplemental Nutrition Assistance Program needed a bit of New Testament spin. How does one defend taking the food out of mouths of hungry people using the Bible? By cherrypicking this quote: If a man will not work, he shall not eat. During a debate on whether or not Republicans will further gut SNAP benefits, Arrington cited the biblical verse in response to a Jewish anti-hunger group pleading with Congress not to do something so foolish as to further dismantle food stamps. He probably thought he was being pretty clever.Arrington isn t the first to use the line. It s extremely popular with conservatives. So popular, in fact, that the Daily Kos once devoted an entire article to debunking the misinterpretation of the quote.What s important to understand is working was secondary in this context, this is not so much a moral decree about work, the main message is a warning not to take advantage of the Christian obligation to feed the hungry, especially if you are screwing up the church and community tasked with doing that by behaving like a twelve year-old socialite.In other words, the real meaning is to judge a man by his heart, not by his employment status. And as the Washington Post points out, in today s economy, being  unemployed  doesn t mean lazy, unmotivated, or being a leech. As the economy continues to separate between the  haves  and the  have-nots,  finding employment can be hard.The verse in question applies specifically to people who can work or otherwise contribute to society but choose not to, said theologians from several denominations who spoke to The Post. There is a perception, among some voters and lawmakers, that many adult SNAP recipients are exactly this sort of  freeloader. But policy experts say that is not the case. Many unemployed adults on SNAP simply cannot work, they say. Those include the mentally ill, the borderline disabled and veterans.Here s economist Justin Wolfers putting the sad reality of America s employment into a stunning graph:It takes a certain kind of mind to look at these trends and conclude that tax cuts for the top 1% are an urgent national priority. pic.twitter.com/6s9Jwr0a8w  Justin Wolfers (@JustinWolfers) March 31, 2017Arrington has both biblical and economic reasons to doubt his own reasoning. Instead, his real ideology   the Church of Conservative Magical Thinking   led him to ignore it all in favor of more cuts to the poor to benefit the very richest in the country.And as if voters needed yet another reminder of why elections matter: Arrington has only been on the job two months. He was voted into office this year. He barely moved into his office and already he s going after the most disadvantaged people in his district. Hats off to his efficiency, but then, institutionalized cruelty often is.Featured image via the Washington Post',\n",
       " 'Republicans claim to be  pro-life,  but one needs only observe to realize that they simply like babies   as long as they are in the womb, that is. Sure, they repeatedly cut funding from programs that feed poor children and actively work to deny kids health care and other necessities   but they sure love promoting abstinence-only sex  education,  which actually increases unwanted pregnancies, and depriving women of the ability to decide whether or not to abort a fetus.Zika is believed to cause severe birth defects like microcephaly, which causes severe brain and skull deformities and can cost hundreds of thousands of dollars in the first year alone. As the GOP wants to deprive poor women of health care, if they had their way these expenses would be crippling. This doesn t even take into account the extra care a child would need, the exhaustion involved in caring for a critically-ill baby, or a number of other factors that would cause someone with the Zika virus to make the difficult decision to terminate a pregnancy.The state of Florida is currently facing a Zika crisis, but that doesn t stop Senator Marco Rubio from sticking to his guns on abortion. To him, women should never be allowed to have one, even in the cases of rape and incest   and not even if the mother has contracted the Zika virus. He told Politico on Saturday: I understand a lot of people disagree with my view   but I believe that all human life is worthy of protection of our laws. And when you present it in the context of Zika or any prenatal condition, it s a difficult question and a hard one. But if I m going to err, I m going to err on the side of life. Obviously, microcephaly is a terrible prenatal condition that kids are born with. And when they are, it s a lifetime of difficulties,  Rubio added.  So I get it. I m not pretending to you that that s an easy question you asked me. But I m pro-life. And I m strongly pro-life. I believe all human life should be protected by our law, irrespective of the circumstances or condition of that life. No matter how much the child suffers, right, Marco?Rubio himself voted to fulfill President Obama s request for funding, so he is aware that there is an issue. He s not hiding from that. But his belief in a book written by a bunch of men who couldn t figure out where the sun hides at night, as well as his devotion to the very party that actively fights to keep women sick, prevents him from accepting the fact that women have the right to make their own health care decisions   including terminating a pregnancy if they have the Zika virus.Meanwhile, as Republicans continue to hold funding hostage over gutting the Clean Water Act and letting truckers drive for longer hours without a break (yes, seriously), Rubio and his ilk will continue to fight against women s right to choose an abortion to save the child from a lifetime of suffering.Featured image via Getty Images/Joe Raedle',\n",

       " 'PHNOM PENH (Reuters) - With Cambodia s opposition warning of the imminent death of its democracy, the historic rival who once beat Prime Minister Hun Sen in an election said there was no option but to work with the strongman. Seventy three year-old Prince Norodom Ranariddh, Hun Sen s opponent in U.N.-supervised elections in 1993, has horrified Cambodia s main opposition party with a call for it to be dissolved after its leader was charged with treason. Ranariddh s career exemplifies not only the swings in Cambodian politics, but also the way Hun Sen, 65, has used force and cunning to neutralize enemies since defecting from the genocidal Khmer Rouge in the 1970s to help drive it from power.  Samdech Hun Sen, you want or you don t want, you like him or you don t like him, he brings about this national unity,  Ranariddh said, using the prime minister s formal title.  According to the law you are not allowed to harm national unity,  the white haired Ranariddh told Reuters on Saturday. Beside him, four aides nodded and pressed together their palms in deferential emphasis. Ranariddh s royalist Funcinpec party won no parliamentary seats in 2013 elections, but would be allocated most of those held by the Cambodia National Rescue Party (CNRP) if it is dissolved after the arrest of leader Kem Sokha last month.  Alongside the government, Funcinpec has sought a ban on the CNRP because of the arrest. Kem Sokha and his party dismiss the charges against him as bogus and an attempt to extend Hun Sen s 32-year rule at the head of the Cambodian People s Party (CPP) amid the biggest crackdown on critics of the prime minister in years.  The prince failed his people when he had the mandate to bring real peace,  said Mu Sochua, a deputy to Kem Sokha who recently fled to exile in fear of arrest.   Now, he is robbing his people of their right to choose the leader of their choice by collaborating with the CPP in the dissolution of the CNRP.  Ranariddh was summoned to politics from his post as a French law lecturer by his wily father, the late King Norodom Sihanouk. With royalist sentiment strong, Ranariddh beat Hun Sen in the 1993 election organized by the United Nations. But when Hun Sen threatened a return to war, Sihanouk did a deal that sidelined his son as a co-prime minister.  Ranariddh was driven into exile in 1997 after his forces were defeated by those of Hun Sen in bloody clashes in Phnom Penh. After international pressure, Ranariddh was allowed to contest elections a year after, but never again came close to winning and entered on and off alliances with Hun Sen. Splits in the party followed and after a spell overseas following accusations of financial scandal, Ranariddh returned in 2015. As he speaks, he switches between English and Khmer with a peppering of French.  We are not puppets,  Ranariddh said beside a huge portrait of his father.  We are definitely not an opposition party but we don t always, always, always say  yes, yes, yes, yes, yes . We can say  no .   Although the United States and other Western countries helped secure Ranariddh s return to Cambodia in the 1990s, he dismissed their criticism of Kem Sokha s arrest and calls on the government to stop moves to ban the CNRP.  I, Norodom Ranariddh, would like them to leave us free to decide,  he said. ',\n",
       " 'When I was a kid, I watched a number of fights on the playground, in the school cafeteria and just on my block. This was true when I was in elementary school and it continued to be true all the way to when I was in high school. If you would have told me that I could be arrested for not breaking up the fight, I would have looked at you like you were certifiably insane.But that was before America decided that criminalizing childhood was a good idea:MURFREESBORO  More than 150 people called for action Sunday after parents said at least five students, ages 6 to 10, were handcuffed at Hobgood Elementary School on Friday.The students were arrested, accused of not stopping a fight that happened earlier off-campus and later released from the juvenile center on FridayThese were not kids that participated in the fight, they just watched it happen and were arrested for it. Think about that for a moment: a 6-year-old child was HANDCUFFED for not breaking up a fight. What did the police think this kid was going to do? Attack them? What kind of thought process leads a grown man to handcuff an elementary school student? Even worse, what kind of society ALLOWS a grown man to handcuff an elementary school student and not immediately fire them as a danger to the public?But back to the flawed premise behind the arrest. I happen to have a 6-year-old of my own and she has a fairly forceful personality, but the idea of her leaping into a fight to break it up is ludicrous. She s 6! And even if she d been 10, when did it become a legal obligation for kids to break up a fight they re not involved in? Don t the police have anything better to do with their time than turn little children into criminals?The icing on the cake was arresting them at the school in front of their classmates. Because leading a 6-year-old out of school in handcuffs can t possibly leave any long-term mental scars, right? Again, we as a society allow this to happen.This is the direct result of a fundamentally broken law enforcement culture. They no longer see communities as made up of people, they only see potential criminals. It seems that the thinking is, if you get them into the system when they re young, you ll have an easier time throwing them in jail later. Never mind that most of the cops involved almost certainly watched a fist fight as a kid, or got into one themselves, it s criminal behavior these days.Oh, and you ll be absolutely shocked to know that the community this occurred in is .you guessed it: Mostly African-American. Because when little Timmy watches a fight, it s just boys being boys. But little Leroy? He s a goddamn criminal and needs to be taught a lesson!With this kind of ongoing behavior, the police are hard at work creating an entire generation of (mostly minority) children that fear and loathe them. And then the cops have the gall to rage at the Black Lives Matter movement? Unbelievable.Featured image via Getty',\n",
       " 'Harvard Law Professor Emeritus Alan Dershowitz was on MSNBC to make a statement on the 9th Circuit Opinion: He stated that the 9th Circuit Court of Appeals  ruling against President Trump s immigration order is  not a solid decision.  And  looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality. Look, this is not a solid decision. This is a decision that looks like it s based more on policy than on constitutionality. There are many, many flaws. He added,  I think this court opinion will not ultimately be sustained by the Supreme Court. Take, for example, the argument that it s an establishment of religion, because it favors Christians or other religious minorities. In 1944 we passed the War Refugee Act, which specifically was designed to rescue a hundred thousand Jews, and everybody knew the purpose was to rescue jews. That didn t establish Judaism as the state religion of the United States. I think the establishment argument will fail in the Supreme Court. I think the standing arguments may fail in the Supreme Court.  ',\n",
       " '21st Century Wire says US college students continue to be emotionally traumatized and  threatened  by Donald Trump s surprise presidential victory this week, sparking a wave of nationally coordinated street protests, organized in part through the George Soros funded Democratic Party  community organizing  web portal MoveOn.org. Various protests and riots have been organized around a number university campuses including Berkeley, Portland, New York City and Los Angleses. When asked why she scared by the election result, one female university student claimed that the President Elect is a  rapist,  while another claim that,  He [Trump] is about to have a court case about a 13 years old girl soon, and I m not down for that. The alleged court case the student is referring was actually dropped, and has since been exposed as a likely politically motivated hoax according to reports.Here is last night s student protest, including multiple interviews from both sides of the debate, filmed last night in  Albuquerque, New Mexico, by Stuart J Hooper.

       " 'The inauguration of President-elect Donald Trump is only a week away, and many of us are still having a really hard time accepting the fact that an erratic, corrupt businessman and former reality television star will be leading the country soon.Trump s inauguration isn t a pleasant thing to discuss for most of us. The majority of Americans want nothing to do with it. Not only have most celebrities refused to perform for Trump, but the parade has been shortened thanks to the lack of interest. Trump s inauguration is going to be a depressing day for most Americans, especially considering that the majority voted AGAINST him. However, there is one beautiful thing we should be very grateful for, and that s the fact that Trump and his supporters are going to be terribly outnumbered.Trump s big day isn t going to be ruined merely because no one wants to sing for him. Instead of being surrounded by praise, he s instead going to be greeted by an insane amount of courageous protesters, and it will be a harsh reminder that he doesn t deserve this position, and he has the lowest approval rating in modern history.The numbers are staggering. It turns out, there will NINE TIMES more busloads of protesters than supporters. As PoliticusUSA reports: Protesters have reserved six times more parking permits for buses (1,800) for the Women s March on Washington than Trump supporters have requested for the inauguration. NBC4 in Washington, D.C. stated: Councilmember Charles Allen told News4 about 200 permits were requested for the inauguration on Friday, Jan. 20. The city has received about 1,800 permits for the following day, Jan. 21, when thousands are expected to attend the Women s March on Washington in protest of President-elect Donald Trump. The Women s March on Washington has a message for Trump, his corrupt administration, and the Republicans who are threatening our human rights and freedoms: In the spirit of democracy and honoring the champions of human rights, dignity, and justice who have come before us, we join in diversity to show our presence in numbers too great to ignore. The Women s March on Washington will send a bold message to our new government on their first day in office, and to the world that women s rights are human rights. We stand together, recognizing that defending the most marginalized among us is defending all of us. This movement is going to be a big slap in Trump s face as he realizes that Americans aren t going to take his sh*tty policies and bigotry lying down. The majority of us are now united   against him.Featured image via Joe Raedle / Getty Images',\n",
       " 'It looks as though Republican presidential candidate Dr. Ben Carson didn t thoroughly read his GOP politicking handbook, because if he had, he wouldn t have said what he just did on the radio.While discussing if the president should nominate a new Supreme Court Justice after the passing of Justice Antonin Scalia, Carson basically told the folks over on WRNN 99.5 FM in South Carolina that President Obama should nominate someone. He was given the hypothetical question of if there was a Republican president in office would all these candidates be asking them to wait to nominate, and Carson replied,  No, they wouldn t. Continuing, he said: But then again, recognize that the two picks that the president has selected are ideologues, so there s really no reason to believe that his next pick wouldn t be an ideologue also. However, Carson never says that Obama shouldn t nominate anyone. He instead said that Supreme Court Justices should have term limits and not be able to endlessly serve until they either die or choose to retire.Carson is drifting away from the lockstep argument coming from Republicans that Obama should hold off and let the next president nominate. He clearly knows that the president is within his right as Commander-in-Chief to make the choice and pick someone new to put before Congress. He also is seemingly admitting that the Democrats have been right this whole time in their explanation of why the president should be nominating someone new to replace Scalia. He undoubtedly sees the double standard they are throwing Obama s way. That double standard being: it s okay for Republicans to nominate in an election year (like Reagan did), but not Democrats.Truth be told, Republicans are panicking. They know they just lost their most conservative voice on the Supreme Court and his replacement has been left in the hands of the very progressive President Obama. The irony is palpable.You can listen to Carson here:[soundcloud url= https://api.soundcloud.com/tracks/247271609  params= color=ff5500  width= 100%  height= 166  iframe= true  /]Featured image: Flickr',\n",

       " 'Microsoft is buying LinkedIn and they have so much cash on hand that they could pay for the professional social network four times over without ever needing to even pick up the phone to start dialing the number of a single bank. Yet, they want a loan for the purchase anyway. Why would a company that s as flush as Microsoft want to take on debt like that when it doesn t have to?The answer s simple   the loan equals a tax deduction for them, and the interest on the loan will lower their tax bill for years to come. Robert McIntyre, of Citizens For Tax Justice, says: It s an odd world where a company is awash in cash and chooses to make the acquisition with debts because they don t want to pay tax. That, combined with all the other ways they can game our tax system, will bring their total annual liability to rates that are far lower than the one corporate America, and Republicans, scream is too high.This particular loophole will allow Microsoft to avoid the 35 percent tax rate they d pay for repatriating cash they re holding overseas that s needed to buy LinkedIn without a loan. Exactly how much tax will they avoid paying just this year?$9 billion. And it s perfectly legal. In fact, most types of corporate tax evasion are perfectly legal.And that s just for one year. They ll avoid millions more on just this particular purchase in the years to come, in addition to all the other ways they ll avoid paying their fair share of taxes. They aren t the only ones doing this. Back in May, a study revealed that multinational corporations are avoiding paying at least $100 billion per year in taxes. That makes the tax evasion problem much worse than previously thought.Much has been made of things like corporate inversions, where corporations buy a smaller, overseas company for the purpose of shifting their headquarters out of the U.S. and thus, avoid our taxes. We also make a big deal about tax havens, such as the Cayman Islands and Switzerland, although we re starting to make headway with banks in countries that serve as tax shelters to put a stop to this type of evasion.But using loans when they re flush with cash is yet another tax evasion method. One might say that people with student loans and home mortgages are doing the same thing. However, people with those two particular types of debt are a) individuals, and b) aren t awash in the kind of cash a company like Microsoft is. So there s a huge difference there.Our official corporate tax rate might be 39.1 percent, and Republicans and our poor, downtrodden multinationals can whine about how high it is all they want. Their crying doesn t change the fact that, each year from 2006 to 2012, more than 60 percent of our corporations paid zero in federal income taxes. You can bet all the benefits they get from loans, like Microsoft is doing, contribute heavily to that. There is nothing that justifies their whining.Think this is just good business? Sure. From a purely profit-oriented perspective, anything that lowers costs is good because it raises the bottom line. There are real-world consequences though, and one of them is a country, like ours, that shifts its tax burden onto individuals who work, and work, and work for these very corporations, and can t bring in enough revenue to actually function properly.Microsoft will buy LinkedIn however it wants. But this, right here, is a perfect example of why our tax code needs to be overhauled. There s no reason at all Microsoft should be able to get a loan and deduct it from its taxes when it has four times the cash it needs to buy LinkedIn. There just isn t.Featured image by David Ramos/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'Jay Dyer 21st Century WireAccording to a recent feature article published by the LA Times, and which has since gone viral, this website, 21st Century Wire, has been placed at the top of a  list  of  fake  news sites compiled by Dr Melissa Zimdars, an associate professor at Merrimack College in Massachusetts. Aside from being a highly political attempt to discredit a number of online news source which Dr Zimdars and the Democratic Party establishment probably labels as  Alt Right,  this coordinated effort also points directly to a much deeper agenda, as part of a larger as psychological operation to create an algorithm for  filtering  (censoring) news items on major internet platforms and social networks.I take that to heart, since I write for 21WIRE. It s no coincidence that this LA Times hit piece comes in the same week that Democratic Party pundits and leaders are blaming Hillary Clinton s loss to Donald Trump on  fake news  posted on Facebook which they claim wrongly influenced voters. Also just by coincidence this week, Facebook, Google and other DNC affiliated Silicon Valley media partners have announced they are planning to draw-up lists of numerous alternative media websites including  right wing  websites as well as known satire sites, and ours  as  fake.  Google and Facebook will then be able to flag and restrict banned websites from being able to earn revenue through their advertising networks. Of course, the real reason for this is explained in my video (watch below) outlining the absurdity of the most astounding liars on the planet   the Mainstream Media  accusing websites like ours as pushing out fake news.  Ultimately, this is an attack on all independent media.It seems that Dr Zimdar s master list  was made to place 21WIRE at the top   and yet, it s perhaps the best site on the list and is the only one that has  been to Syria,  reported on the ground in Aleppo, and even met with Syria  president Assad   all things that most corporate mainstream media outlets have not managed to do. 21WIRE also blasted faux NGO the White Helmets away as a western-funded propaganda front. 21WIRE is subject to regular DDoS attacks and regularly does real journalism. It is also edited by accredited journalists and is frequently featured on radio and television. That is why it has been targeted in this hit piece   because it is independent and not attached to any political party.Watch my video analysis here: ***Jay Dyer is the author of the new book, Esoteric Hollywood: Sex, Cults and Symbols in Film from Trine Day Publishers.

       " 'I just happened to be listening to Rush today and want to pass this on to everyone. Please share this and stop the false story being reported to try and bring down Trump. It s bad enough that the lefty media is trying to take down Trump with big lies, but now it s the establishment Republicans like Kasich who re doing the Trump Trashing. Shame on them!TRANSCRIPT OF RUSH LIMBAUGH EXPLAINING THE BIG LIE TOLD ABOUT TRUMP: RUSH: Now, I don t know if you have seen it yet today. There are stories all over the Drive-By Media   the Associated Press, Yahoo News, I mean, it s everywhere   that Donald Trump supposedly is calling for the registration of all Muslims in America. Trump is demanding that they all be registered and that a massive database be collected. CNN is all over reporting this. Even the Wall Street Journal has picked up on it. There s a problem, though: Trump didn t say it. I m gonna tell you what happened. At a recent public appearance Trump s coming off the stage after one of his usual one hour to 90-minute appearances.He s probably worn out and spent, and there s the usual crowd of autograph seekers and supporters and fans, and amongst them is a Drive-By Media reporter who says to Trump,  Should there be a database system that tracks the Muslims that are in this country?  Trump says,  There should be a lot of systems, beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems, and today you can do it. But right now we have to have a border. We have to have strength, we have to have a wall, and we cannot let what s happening to this country happen again.  Reporter:  Is that something your White House would like to implement? There s no specificity there. The question is just,  Is that something your White House would like to implement?  Trump has given a multifaceted answer. She says,  Is that something,  without specifying what she s asking about. Trump said,  Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely,  and that s how they report that Trump  demands a database and registration for all Muslims,  when he didn t say it! He never said it. It s a Journalism 101 trick. It s right out of the manual they teach you at the first year of journalism school in how to destroy political opponents or powerful people you don t like. It s that common a technique.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: Now, I m not sure, but I think that the reporter that asked Trump the question and has totally, totally twisted this purposefully to convey something that did not happen, I think the reporter works for Business Insider. I think the reporter is Hunter Walker. If that s who it is, you need to know that this guy is a major backer of Hillary Clinton, as most in the Drive-By Media are. He has written endless articles championing her, and now I think he writes for Yahoo News and is the Business Insider politics editor.So here is how this happened. This is in Newton, Iowa, yesterday after a campaign event. Trump s leaving the stage, and a reporter says,  Should there be a database system to track Muslims in this country?  Now, nobody has suggested that, keep in mind. Trump has not suggested it. So the reporter s not asking a question bouncing off anything Trump has said. It s just a question thrown at Trump, and it comes to him in the midst of autograph seekers and fans and supporters wanting to meet him after his performance is finished.TRUMP: There should be a lot of systems beyond database. We should have a lot of systems. And today you can do it. But right now we have to have a border. We have to have strength. We have to have a wall. And we cannot let what s happening to this country happen.REPORTER: But is it something your White House would like to implement?TRUMP: Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely.REPORTER: What do you think the effect of that would be? How would that work?TRUMP: It would stop people from coming in illegally. We have to stop people from coming into our country illegally.REPORTER: Muslims specifically, how do you actually get them registered into a database?TRUMP: It would be just good management. What you have to do is good management procedures. And we can do that.REPORTER: Would you go to mosques and sign these people up into the system?TRUMP: Different places. You sign  em up at different   but it s all about management. Our country has no management.RUSH: Okay. Now, two things about this. The first is, as I said, everybody in the Drive-By Media is running with this because they think they ve got Trump again. They re salivating out there, folks, they are hoping, they ve got their fingers crossed, they ve doubled down, they re putting this story everywhere: Trump sexist, Trump bigoted, Trump anti-Muslim, wants a database; wants to go to their mosques to sign  em up; wants to have them carry around symbols on their clothes to tell everybody who they are. And he never said it.This reporter, Hunter Walker, retweeted the headline from the AP. The AP headline:  Trump Says He Would Absolutely Implement Muslim Database.  This little know-nothing reporter is so proud of his work today. This, as I say, journalism 101. This is what they teach you when you want to take out a political opponent or a powerful person you don t like, this is how you do it, with innuendo.Again, here s what happened. Trump comes offstage,  Should there be a database system that tracks Muslims that are in this country?  It s a setup question from the get-go. Nobody has suggested it. Trump said there should be a lot of systems beyond databases. We should have a lot of systems. And today you can do it, but right now we have to have a border. We have to have strength. We have to have a wall, and we can t let what s happening to this country happen again.He has not confirmed a database. He has not confirmed registration of Muslims. He s changed the question to his favorite subject, the wall and the border and keeping illegal immigrants out. The reporter says,  Is that something your White House would like to implement?  Not specifying. If anything, the guy s talking about the border. The last thing Trump said in his answer was talking about the border, strength, a wall. The reporter says,  Is that something your White House would like to implement?  There is nothing specified. The use of the word  that,  the reporter then can say,  Well, I meant Muslim registration, look what Trump said, Trump knew what I was talking about. But Trump s answer was,  Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely. Reporter:  What do you think the effect of that would be? It would stop people from coming in illegally.  Trump s still talking about the border. He s still talking about the wall. He says,  We have to stop people from coming into this country illegally.  So how in the world can Trump be talking about the registration of Muslims or anybody when he s still talking about keeping people out of the country? Muslims are here. This is a good, old-fashioned hatchet job by this low-rent reporter named Hunter Walker who s got everybody in the media reporting it the way he wants because this is what they want people to believe about Trump. This is what they believe about all Republicans. We re bigots, we re racists, sexists and so forth, and Trump s just come along and confirmed it. And I guarantee you there s a contest inside the Drive-By Media to see who can be the one to take Trump out.Here is what they are forgetting. This isn t gonna hurt Trump. Even their journalistic malpractice is not gonna hurt Trump. They haven t figured that out. They keep applying standard, ordinary, everyday tactics on hit pieces to Donald Trump, and all that happens as a result is that Trump increases his support. Trump s support gets stronger. It gets deeper every time they try something like this because Trump is dead serious about protecting this country and its borders and keeping terrorists and so forth out of the country. He makes no bones about it. He s one of the only candidates that s unwavering on it. It s the number one issue.And you combine what s happening with ISIS in Paris and border security, national security, protecting and defending the country and the people who live here is far and away the number one most important issue because everything descends from it. The economy descends from it. Jobs descend from it. Everything that matters descends from this country remaining a country. It has to have a border. That border has to be enforced. Trump s the only guy talking about. They think they ve got him. They re gonna be crying in whatever it is they drink. This is not going to rip the bottom out of Trump s campaign. It s not gonna destroy Trump s campaign no matter how much they re lying, no matter how they try to distort this, because Trump did not say he s in favor of registration or a database of all Muslims in America.And once again, what s gonna happen here is an ever increasingly aware and sophisticated public is gonna just get angrier and angrier at the usual childish tactics of the very unrespected Drive-By Media. Once the public learns what s happened here, the anger is not gonna be at Trump. There wouldn t have been that much anger at Trump anyway among his supporters. That s what they don t understand. You people in the media have got to understand something. You re gonna have to go about this a different way. You didn t make Trump; you can t destroy him. There s nothing you can do. And look at the lengths they re now going to try. Exactly what they did to Romney, by the way. This is no different than Harry Reid saying,  Mitt Romney hasn t paid his taxes in ten years.   Hey, look at Mitt Romney putting the family dog on top of the station wagon.   Hey, Mitt Romney, one of his employees  wives died of cancer, Romney didn t care, went ahead and canceled the health care plan, didn t care. I don t think this guy s questions were even registering with Trump. I think Trump continued to talk with his own framework in mind, meaning his focus on the wall. Because if you continue on with the sound bite   keep in mind here that Trump s never talked about registering or having a database of Muslims. The reporter asks a fake question:  Is that something your White House would do, like to implement?  Trump answers,  Yeah.  He keeps talking about the wall. He keeps talking about the border.  Oh, I would certainly implement that, absolutely.  Trump s still talking about the border.The reporter says,  What do you think the effect of that would be? How would that work? Trump:  It would stop people from coming in illegally.  He s still talking about the border. He s still talking about his wall.  We have to stop people from coming in illegally. Reporter:  For Muslims specifically, how do you actually get them registered in your database?  Trump has never said that he wants to register them in his database. He s talking about the wall. He s talking about the border. This idiot, talentless reporter says,  Well, for Muslims specifically, how do you actually get them registered in your database?  Trump says,  It would be good management. What you have to do is good management procedures, and we can do that.  He s still talking about the wall. He s not even listening to this kid. He s walking out of there, he s answering the question, he s got it answered, he s on the wall, he s on the border, that s what he s talking about.When it s all over the reporter makes it up that Trump s talking about registration of Muslims and a database. Totally makes it up. Anyway, I gotta take a break here. I just wanted you to see this. I wanted you to hear it, the reporter s own words, Trump s own words because it s been picked up everywhere, and, mark my words, the next poll that comes out, Trump s just gonna jump even higher and they re not gonna know what to do with themselves in the Drive-Bys. But you people in the media are gonna have to learn something. When you don t make somebody, you can t destroy him. And you haven t made Trump. The media has nothing to do with why Trump s where he is, and therefore you can t take him out. You can try, you may think you can, but he s got a bond, a connection with his supporters and his audience that you people are not gonna be able to break no matter how hard you try.BREAK TRANSCRIPTRUSH: So you know how this works? I just got an e-mail from a friend of mine who plays around on Facebook, and he sent me a screenshot of his Facebook post that he sent out, and he wants me to know that he s on top things. He says,  Yeah, Trump wants to register all Muslims. The last guy that wanted to do that was Hitler with the Jews! Come on, folks! We re going backwards.  So I just had to write him back:  Hey, buddy, you ve got it 180 degrees wrong. Trump didn t say it!  This is a guy that reads the news all day. This is exactly how this happens. You ve got every Drive-By news source now reporting this.originalI m not sure who the reporter was that actually got this whole thing started, but there are the suspects who have taken what that kid did and expanded it are all over the place. You could mention any Drive-By name out there and you d be pretty close to being accurate about who did this. I m not exactly sure who the reporter was at the Trump event. I was told one thing and now I m told that that s not necessarily true. But the guy s name I gave you is still responsible for expanding, amplifying, and leading this. That Hunter Walker is who kicked it all off. Doesn t really matter.I mean, they re all the same stripe, and they ve all got the same objective here. And this e-mail I just got from a friend of mine   who s not an idiot, and you know, he s not a casual consumer of news. It s in the Wall Street Journal. This guy s a financial guy. He read it in the Wall Street Journal, and the Wall Street Journal to these guys is gospel. I have tried to tell every friend of mine, and it s probably gone for naught. I ve tried to tell them just based on the way I get covered, and they know me and they know what s written about me is all bogus. I said,  Could you not apply that to every story you hear, particularly about people you support? Could you just learn to not believe anything you read if it s defaming Republicans in the Drive-By Media? Could you just learn to be suspicious of it and try to confirm it on your own? (sigh) But it doesn t work that way. People believe it.  There it is! It s in print. It s right there,  or,  It s on my screen, Rush! I mean, they can t write stuff that isn t true!  I can t tell you how often I hear that. So Trump s gonna  I don t know how he s gonna deal with this. He will, but  (sigh) Let me  I m gonna go ahead and get in trouble myself here. Can I give you what I think might have happened with a lot of people when they first saw this BS story?What do you think? You re driving around or you re reading or whatever and you hear,  Trump wants to register all Muslims!  (interruption) Yeah. (chuckles) Get my drift? So I m just marveling here. I m thankful for the opportunity. I m thankful I haven t retired. I m thankful I ve still got this program and a chance to come here every day and illustrate the dishonest, the reprehensible, the just scummy way these people work. And each time I see something like this, I focus even more on,  They re not media!  This isn t media! This isn t the news. The media is the Democrat Party. The media is all part of the left-wing establishment that s trying to advance the Democrat Party agenda.Every time I see a story like,  Trump has to fight media here or overcome media,  I ask: Why would you have to overcome the media? The media s just a bunch of journalists telling people what happened who weren t there. (thumps table) Of course, this is the exact opposite. Everybody knows now, or many people. And even people who know what the media is, still get sucked in and believe this stuff. But when you read the transcript of what Trump said, when you actually read it or hear it and then compare it to the news being reported, you can t escape the fact that the media s making it up; that Trump never said it.Read more: Rush Limbaugh',\n",
       " 'At this point, pretty much everyone knows that failed vice presidential nominee Sarah Palin hates the media. She hates being called out, and she hates being asked questions she just doesn t know the answer to   which is pretty much every question. She clearly gets embarrassed, and instead of owning up to the fact that she just simply doesn t know an answer, she blames the press for depicting her as a moron. Little does she know, she does that to herself.However, people with narcissistic personality disorder seldom see the error in their own ways and will often shift blame. You can see this with Donald Trump and in his new #1 fan, Sarah Palin. They only see themselves as perfect and anyone who dares make them look otherwise is clearly just wrong.Case in point: Palin, upon leaving Iowa, met up with some lovely students at the Des Moines airport. She could have just left it there and said something nice, but instead she had to throw a jab at the press calling them  media jackals.  She also openly admitted that she prefers being interviewed by these children over credentialed professional journalists.Palin wrote on Facebook (as she does): Willow and I find it nice to be stuck in Des Moines airport with great kids like this Santa Monica class that traveled to the Iowa caucus on a field trip. (Preferable to some media jackals weather-delayed in here, too. I asked a few of them to take lessons from these 6th graders.) Such polite students, asking the best questions about our political system! Told them it was the best interview of the week! // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ // < ![CDATA[ (function(d, s, id) { var js, fjs = d.getElementsByTagName(s)[0]; if (d.getElementById(id)) return; js = d.createElement(s); js.id = id; js.src = \"//connect.facebook.net/en_US/sdk.js#xfbml=1&#038;version=v2.3\"; fjs.parentNode.insertBefore(js, fjs);}(document, \\'script\\', \\'facebook-jssdk\\')); // ]]&gt;Willow and I find it nice to be stuck in Des Moines airport with great kids like this Santa Monica class that traveled Posted by Sarah Palin on Tuesday, February 2, 2016And while some may say that going after her for this post is pretty petty, let s think about that for a second. Palin has consistently gone after the  lamestream media  for asking her  gotcha questions  all the time.  Gotcha questions  of course being questions she has no clue how to answer and doesn t want to be perceived as an idiot, so she flips the script back on those posing the question.It makes perfect sense that Palin would want to be interviewed by a bunch of 6th graders. Individuals that she may actually know more than   or at least they won t know when she s lying and making things up. Even better that they won t call her out. So, if Palin is going to make a point of telling the world that she prefers 6th graders over the  media jackals,  well, she deserves to be called out on it. She hates the media, because the media holds her accountable.Featured image: Flickr',\n",

       " 'The reason why many conservatives support Donald Trump is because they literally think he will erase the last 60 years of American history.After the third and final debate on Wednesday night, Face The Nation host John Dickerson sat down with a group of Nevada voters at a restaurant and talked to them about the candidates.But when he talked to a woman named Barbara, you could the hypocrisy, ignorance, and bigotry in her eyes as she let her crazy flag fly for all to hear and see.Barbara told the CBS host that she is voting for Trump because she believes in  morality and values. Now, many of you probably laughed out loud when you read that because the last thing the Republican nominee represents is morality and values. Trump s words about groping women, his nods and winks to white supremacists, the multiple sexual assault allegations against him, the tapes of him hitting on underage girls, and all of the nasty remarks he has made about just about every group in America completely disqualifies him from having any claim to being the moral candidate.And Barbara demonstrated that by openly revealing herself as an anti-gay bigot because she thinks Trump will take the nation back to a time when homosexuals were persecuted and women s reproductive rights were controlled exclusively by men, a time she claims the founding fathers approved of. Based on what the country was based on, I think that the laws that Obama has passed, the way the country has   I call it down turning. Some of the other people are proud of it and happy for it. I personally am against it, the homosexuals, the abortions. All the stuff, I am against. Dickerson then asked her a follow-up question for clarification. When Donald Trump says  Make American Great Again,  is that what you hear? That it s going to go back to before the time that you re now describing? That s part of it,  Barbara answered.Oh, and Barbara is, of course, a religious nut.  She needs prayer,  Barbara said about Hillary Clinton.  The country always needs prayer. Apparently, Barbara and Trump supporters like her think oppressing women and gay people is morally right in this country which makes it a complete travesty that her vote counts as much as a sane person s vote.Here s the video via YouTube.And Trump supporters wonder why everyone is mocking them.Featured Image: Screenshot',\n",
       " ' In response to the establishment media s contrived  fake news  crisis designed to marginalise independent and alternative media sources of news and analysis, 21WIRE is running its own #FakeNewsWeek awareness campaign, where each day our editorial team at 21st Century Wire will feature media critiques and analysis of mainstream corporate media coverage of current events   exposing the government and the mainstream media as the real purveyors of  fake news  throughout modern history  MSM LIES: Judith Miller of the New York Times was a key media operative used to sell the Iraq War to the public.  By Timothy Alexander GuzmanThe mainstream media (MSM) has declared war on alternative media websites labeling them Fake News ever since Hillary Clinton lost the election to Donald Trump. The New York Times editorial board expressed their frustration in an article calling for the censorship of alternative and social media    Facebook and the Digital Virus Called Fake News, which claimed both social media platforms (Facebook and Google) has not been aggressive enough in blocking fake news sites: Most of the fake news stories are produced by scammers looking to make a quick buck. The vast majority of them take far-right positions. But a big part of the responsibility for this scourge rests with internet companies like Facebook and Google, which have made it possible for fake news to be shared nearly instantly with millions of users and have been slow to block it from their sites. Some of the websites named in a fake news list by Melissa  Mish  Zimdars, an assistant professor of communication at Merrimack College in Massachusetts including 21st Century Wire, Activist Post, Global Research.ca, Lew Rockwell.com, Natural News.com and ProjectVeritas (who released undercover videos of the DNC attempting to rig the elections) and others have exposed the lies by MSM [mainstream media] propaganda.The MSM has lost its credibility and at the same time lost viewers at unprecedented levels. on April 17, 2016, the Associated Press reported on how the U.S. population viewed the MSM    Poll: Getting facts right key to Americans  trust in media said that,  Just 6 percent of people say they have a lot of confidence in the media, putting the news industry about equal to Congress and well below the public s view of other institutions. Now they want to stop the alternative media from becoming a credible source for news. The New York Times is calling for the censorship of the alternative and social media by blocking misinformation :Blocking misinformation will help protect the company s brand and credibility. Some platforms have suffered when they have failed to address users  concerns. Twitter users, for instance, have backed away from that platform because of abusive trolling, threatening posts and hate speech, which the company hasn t been able to control.Mr. Zuckerberg himself has spoken at length about how social media can help improve society. In a 2012 letter to investors, he said it could  bring a more honest and transparent dialogue around government that could lead to more direct empowerment of people, more accountability for officials and better solutions to some of the biggest problems of our time.  None of that will happen if he continues to let liars and con artists hijack his platform.Just to be clear, there are a number of websites that do spread misinformation including those in the alternative media, but it is fair to say that they never have caused the deaths of millions of people like The New York Times when it comes to U.S. foreign policy. A recent example is the U.S. led war against Iraq in 2003. After the September 11th attacks, the George W. Bush administration made a false accusation that the Iraq government had Weapons of Mass Destruction (WMDs) which led to a U.S. invasion eventually toppling Iraqi President Saddam Hussein. The U.S. led war turned out to be a calculated plan by The Project for the New American Century (PNAC), a neo-conservative think-tank who wrote the secretive blueprint called,  Rebuilding America s Defenses: Strategies, Forces And Resources For A New Century to remove Saddam Hussein and the Ba ath party from power. The blueprint was originally written for the neocon lunatics who served under then-President George W. Bush including Vice-President Dick Cheney and Defense Secretary Donald Rumsfeld to establish an international Security order dominated by the United States. According to the document: In broad terms, we saw the project as building upon the defense strategy outlined by the Cheney Defense Department in the waning days of the Bush Administration. The Defense Policy Guidance (DPG) drafted in the early months of 1992 provided a blueprint for maintaining U.S. preeminence, precluding the rise of a great power rival, and shaping the international security order in line with American principles and interests. PNAC was founded by neoconservatives William Kristol, a political analyst, media commentator (FOX News, ABC News) and the founder and editor of The Weekly Standard and Robert Kagan, an author, columnist, and foreign-policy commentator who is a member of the Council of Foreign Relations (CFR) and a fellow at the Brookings Institution. Kagan is also the husband of Victoria Nuland, the Assistant Secretary of State for European and Eurasian Affairs appointed by President Obama who helped orchestrate a coup against the Ukrainian government of the democratically elected President Viktor Yanukovych. The blueprint for regime change in Iraq was planned way before George W. Bush became President in 2001: Indeed, the United States has for decades sought to play a more permanent role in Gulf regional security. While the unresolved conflict with Iraq provides the immediate justification, the need for a substantial American force presence in the Gulf transcends the issue of the regime of Saddam Hussein. However, Judith Miller (who is currently an adjunct fellow at the Manhattan Institute) and The New York Times played a crucial role for the Bush Administration. Miller wrote one of the main articles on Iraq s  WMDs  that justified the Bush Administration s agenda to topple Saddam Hussein and the Ba ath party. The article was not just  fake  news telling a lie that deceived the public, it destroyed a sovereign nation. The U.S. war against Iraq killed more than 1.4 million Iraqis (according to www.justforeignpolicy.org estimates) and more than 4,400 U.S. troops and tens of thousands permanently injured. The Iraq War also displaced millions of Iraqis thus creating a refugee crisis in neighboring countries including Syria. The destabilization of Iraq has also created a terrorist recruiting base that has spread throughout the Middle East including Syria.The New York Times published Miller s article on April 21st, 2003    AFTER EFFECTS: PROHIBITED WEAPONS; Illicit Arms Kept Till Eve of War, An Iraqi Scientist Is Said to Assert which claimed that an Iraqi scientist confirmed that the Iraqi government had WMDs:They said the scientist led Americans to a supply of material that proved to be the building blocks of illegal weapons, which he claimed to have buried as evidence of Iraq s illicit weapons programs. The scientist also told American weapons experts that Iraq had secretly sent unconventional weapons and technology to Syria, starting in the mid-1990 s, and that more recently Iraq was cooperating with Al Qaeda, the military officials said.The Americans said the scientist told them that President Saddam Hussein s government had destroyed some stockpiles of deadly agents as early as the mid-1990 s, transferred others to Syria, and had recently focused its efforts instead on research and development projects that are virtually impervious to detection by international inspectors, and even American forces on the ground combing through Iraq s giant weapons plantsOn April, 22, 2003, Miller appeared on the PBS News Hour and spoke about her evidence on what she described as a Silver Bullet from an Iraqi scientist who allegedly worked on Saddam s weapons program:RAY SUAREZ: The task of finding that definitive proof falls in part to specialized teams within the U.S. Military. New York Times correspondent Judith Miller is reporting on the search conducted by units of the 75th exploitation task force. And she joins us now by phone south of Baghdad. Judith Miller, welcome back to the program. Has the unit you ve been traveling with found any proof of weapons of mass destruction in Iraq?JUDITH MILLER: Well, I think they found something more than a  smoking gun.  What they ve found is what is being called here by the members of MET Alpha  that s Mobile Exploitation Team Alpha  what they found is a silver bullet in the form of a person, an Iraqi individual, a scientist, as we ve called him, who really worked on the programs, who knows them firsthand, and who has led MET Team Alpha people to some pretty startling conclusions that have kind of challenged the American intelligence community s under  previous understanding of, you know, what we thought the Iraqis were doing.RAY SUAREZ: Does this confirm in a way the insistence coming from the U.S. government that after the war, various Iraqi tongues would loosen, and there might be people who would be willing to help?JUDITH MILLER: Yes, it clearly does. I mean, it s become pretty clear to those of us on the ground that the international inspectors, without actually controlling the territory and changing the political environment, would never have been able to get these people to step forward. I mean, you can only do that when you know there is not going to be a secret policeman at your door the next day, and that your family isn t going to suffer because you re talking. And that s what the Bush administration has finally done. They have changed the political environment, and they ve enabled people like the scientists that MET Alpha has found to come forth. Now, what initially the weapons hunters thought they were going to find were stockpiles of kind of chemical and biological agents. That s what they anticipated finding. We now know from the scientist that, in fact, that probably isn t what we re going to find. What they will find, and what they have found so far, are kind of precursors; that is, building blocks of what you would need to put together a chemical or a biological weapon.But those stockpiles that we ve heard about, well, those have either been destroyed by Saddam Hussein, according to the scientists, or they have been shipped to Syria for safekeeping. And what I think the interpretation of the MET Alpha people is, is why he did this. They believe that Saddam Hussein wanted to destroy the evidence of his unconventional weapons programs, and that s what he has done  not only since 1995, but also in the weeks and months that led up to the war itself. There was mass destruction. And the scientist who has been cooperating with MET Alpha has actually said that he participated in  he kind of watched, you know, a warehouse being burned that contained potentially incriminating biological equipment. So clearly what Saddam Hussein wanted to do was cover his weapons of mass destruction tracks. And that means that the whole shape of the hunt here on the ground for unconventional weapons is changing.The problem with Miller s assertion that Iraq had WMDs is that it relied on an Iraqi exile named Ahmed Chalabi who wanted regime change against Saddam Hussein s government. James Moore of The Guardian wrote,  How Chalabi and the White House held the front page    how  The New York Times has burned its reputation on a pyre of lies about Iraq    described Chalabi as a convicted criminal who embezzled millions from his Petra Bank in Amman, Jordan. Moore said the following: Judith Miller, a Pulitzer Prize-winning reporter and authority on the Middle East for the NYT, appears to have been the most reliant on Chalabi. In an email exchange with the NYT s Baghdad bureau chief John Burns, Miller said Chalabi  had provided most of the front page exclusives for our paper . She later said that this was an exaggeration, but in an earlier interview with me, Miller did not discount the value of Chalabi s insight.  Of course, I talked with Chalabi,  she said.  But he was just one of many sources I used. Miller refused to say who those other sources were but, at Chalabi s behest, she interviewed various defectors from Saddam Hussein s regime, who claimed without substantiation that there was still a clandestine WMD programme operating inside Iraq. US investigators now believe that Chalabi sent these same Iraqi expatriates to at least eight Western spy agencies as part of a scheme to convince them to overthrow Saddam. Mr. Moore mentioned Miller s article which was co-written with Michael R. Gordon and published by The New York Times on September 8th, 2002 titled,  THREATS AND RESPONSES: THE IRAQIS; U.S. SAYS HUSSEIN INTENSIFIES QUEST FOR A-BOMB PARTS    claiming that Saddam was building a uranium gas separator to develop nuclear material :If spies wanted a trophy to show what happens when their craft is perfectly executed, it would be a story written by Judith Miller on the front page of the New York Times on a Sunday morning in September 2002. She wrote that an intercepted shipment of aluminum tubes, to be used for centrifuges, was evidence that Saddam was building a uranium gas separator to develop nuclear material.The story had an enormous impact, one amplified when national security adviser Condoleezza Rice, secretary of state Colin Powell and vice-president Dick Cheney all did appearances on the Sunday-morning talk shows, citing the first-rate journalism of the liberal NYT. No single story did more to advance the neoconservative cause.Here is the original excerpt from Miller s original September 8th 2002 New York Times article: More than a decade after Saddam Hussein agreed to give up weapons of mass destruction, Iraq has stepped up its quest for nuclear weapons and has embarked on a worldwide hunt for materials to make an atomic bomb, Bush administration officials said today.In the last 14 months, Iraq has sought to buy thousands of specially designed aluminum tubes, which American officials believe were intended as components of centrifuges to enrich uranium. American officials said several efforts to arrange the shipment of the aluminum tubes were blocked or intercepted but declined to say, citing the sensitivity of the intelligence, where they came from or how they were stopped. According to Moore (and many other journalists, researchers and alternative media outlets), Judith Miller s story was completely false and that the the aluminum tubes were covered with an anodised coating, which rendered them useless for a centrifuge, according to a number of scientists who spoke publicly after Miller s story. Moore continued the tubes, in fact, were almost certainly intended for use as rocket bodies. Lastly, Moore quoted what Miller had told him about her sources which lead to the WMD hoax: I had no reason to believe what I reported was inaccurate,  Miller told me.  I believed the intelligence I had. We tried really hard to get more information and we vetted information very, very carefully.  A few months after the aluminum tubes story, a former CIA analyst explained to me how simple it had been to manipulate the correspondent and her newspaper. The White House had a perfect deal with Miller,  he said.  Chalabi is providing the Bush people with the information they need to support their political objectives, and he is supplying the same material to Judy Miller. Chalabi tips her on something and then she goes to the White House, which has already heard the same thing from Chalabi, and she gets it corroborated. She also got the Pentagon to confirm things for her, which made sense, since they were working so closely with Chalabi. Too bad Judy didn t spend a little more time talking to those of us who had information that contradicted almost everything Chalabi said. The New York Times was clearly embarrassed by Miller s articles after the fact that Miller was wrong all along about the WMDs that led up to the invasion of Iraq. Nothing was ever found. On May 26th, 2004, the editorial board admitted their wrongdoing. The article,  FROM THE EDITORS; The Times and Iraq,  stated that,  We have examined the failings of American and allied intelligence, especially on the issue of Iraq s weapons and possible Iraqi connections to international terrorists which blames U.S. and other intelligence agencies (which do share the blame to an extent).The editorial piece continued We have studied the allegations of official gullibility and hype. It is past time we turned the same light on ourselves. Well, they do turn the light on themselves, sort of: But we have found a number of instances of coverage that was not as rigorous as it should have been. In some cases, information that was controversial then, and seems questionable now, was insufficiently qualified or allowed to stand unchallenged. Looking back, we wish we had been more aggressive in re-examining the claims as new evidence emerged   or failed to emerge.The problematic articles varied in authorship and subject matter, but many shared a common feature. They depended at least in part on information from a circle of Iraqi informants, defectors and exiles bent on  regime change  in Iraq, people whose credibility has come under increasing public debate in recent weeks. (The most prominent of the anti-Saddam campaigners, Ahmad Chalabi, has been named as an occasional source in Times articles since at least 1991, and has introduced reporters to other exiles. He became a favorite of hard-liners within the Bush administration and a paid broker of information from Iraqi exiles, until his payments were cut off last week). Complicating matters for journalists, the accounts of these exiles were often eagerly confirmed by United States officials convinced of the need to intervene in Iraq. Administration officials now acknowledge that they sometimes fell for misinformation from these exile sources. So did many news organizations   in particular, this one The New York Times admittance that their journalistic principals had failed was too little and too late. The MSM in particular The New York Times relied on  fake  evidence from Ahmad Chalabi for years (since 1991 to be exact). The MSM failed the Iraqi people who suffered enormously under a pack of lies that destroyed their country. When Washington uses  propaganda  or fake news reports against a sovereign nation, the outcome is always  regime change  that sometimes leads to an all-out war. The MSM has time and time again been guilty of perpetrating fake news stories to assist in Washington s Imperial agenda.The Iraq War was the biggest lie of the 21st century. What other fake news stories will appear on the MSM websites and newspapers in the future regarding Syria, Russia, China, Iran, the Palestinians, Venezuela, Cuba, Ecuador, Nicaragua, and even the U.S. President-elect, Donald Trump?To answer that, we just don t know, but it is up to the alternative media to decipher the  fake  stories and bring out the truth. It is just a matter of time that the MSM will falsify another story; let s just hope it won t lead to another war in the process.*** Author Timothy Alexander Guzman is an independent researcher and writer with a focus on political, economic, media and historical spheres.

       " ' Photo illustration by Patrick Henningsen@21WIRE  Nader Talebzadeh   21st Century WireThe American enlightenment has started.  The dormancy of over three decades, and the miseries that the United States has put dozens of nations through, have begun to cease. The torment that the Vietnamese went through and the innocent lives that perished under US drones in Afghanistan and Pakistan are beginning to find their answers.  But not in international tribunals or world system of justice. No. In people s conscious, the great divide in the American population is the first sure sign of a change to come.Ever since the unwelcome appearance of Donald Trump on the US governmental scene, the first president not to be placed into position by the deep state, the inquisition over what is going on has begun.Americans, more than ever are perplexed about their future. Their past is vague, and no matter how hard they peer into the rear view mirror   for those Americans, it doesn t make sense.9/11 doesn t make sense.The occupation of Iraq and Afghanistan doesn t make sense.The admittance to not finding any WMDs in Iraq and yet occupying it, doesn t make sense.To cause the deaths of 500, 000 children, and say it was worth the kill by the administrators   doesn t make sense.The cover-up for 9/11 doesn t make sense. To start a global war on terror and not explain how 9/11 occurred, or how a third building collapsed nine hours later, doesn t make sense.Obama s sudden appearance on the scene, doesn t make sense.The hundreds of books and articles that question the mechanism of the selection of Obama and never discussing them on the mainstream media, doesn t make sense.Obama placed in that position by the establishment, by the deep state, doesn t make sense.The blanked out middle-class of America, still pondering what happened, doesn t make sense.The fact that they lost their jobs beginning three decades ago, and having had to let go of their comfortable insured life working in an American factory, doesn t make sense.The abandoned factories and grand industries that once made America great, lying obsolete and deserted, doesn t make sense.Half of Detroit abandoned and deserted, doesn t make sense.The media cheering on its hallucinatory concussions all throughout these disasters, doesn t make sense.The PTSD ed war veterans and the official suicide rates of US soldiers on and off duty, go undetected and barely seen in the rear view mirror of the media, never make sense.All the common man sees today is one man attacked by the same mass  media that pushed them into the illegal wars and illegitimate debts from zero to $20 trillion, between 1979-2017, by some estimates.But the  buck stops here  as President Eisenhower once famously said. The heavy train loaded with old rusted debris is coming to a screeching halt. Meanwhile the curious are looking wide-eyed. NATO doesn t know where it really stands.  The think tanks of Washington   the hub of all mesmerizing strategies   are vacant, or their curtains half drawn. The Neocons are contemplating plan B. The  Israeli firsters  are caught off guard. They are planning ahead of time desperately. But whose ears do they have this time?! A man who calls the weapons of the think tanks, the mainstream media,  liars  ,  fake news !?Once the invisible sword, the likes of New York Times and CNN are today exposed and blunted. Who dared call CNN  liars ?! CNN engaged America meticulously into two  fake  wars which indebted the United States, and still avoided any blame. It was almost scripted and storyboarded like a Hollywood movie. Now, it is still loose, with acrobatic skills evading all detection like a skilled serial killer breathing in our civilized world.Now the eye-opening process has begun. Watch out for the six-packers and their evaporated illusions! You have finally awaken the slumbering slave of America, and awakened they are Alas! All empires go through these stages.  The awkward moments must be tolerated i.e. the president without a cabinet, the supporters with semi-automatic weapons guarding his speeches in Georgia and Florida. The anti-Semitic accusations that are being discussed in the morning regular sessions on CNN. The angry obliterated Alan Dershowitz who is nervously accusing CNN s moderator Don Lemon, of giving the anti-Semites their fifteen minutes of fame. They fear that it will catch fire on the colleges and universities.The masquerade however is over. The Paul Wolfowitzs, the Richard Perles, the Daniel Pipes have to face the masses. The not-so-innocent masses that succumbed to the beast s demands also wait. The confrontation lingers silently.  No one even knows these people  as Thomas Friedman of the New York Times once famously said in his interviews with the Haaretz. Twenty Five Neocons have planned and executed what has happened in the past two and a half decades.The wakeup call has rung, the moment of illusion has disappeared. The apparent, sudden sun is beginning to shine gloriously, one ray at a time.

       " 'The President who shoved his radical agenda down the throats of Americans is about to watch his legacy unwind in favor of jobs and a stronger economy  President Obama s eight-year effort to rein in the energy and mining industries with environmental regulations will likely come to a halt under President-elect Donald Trump, who is poised to green-light key job-creating projects from the Atlantic Coast to Alaska.With the election of Donald Trump   and a transition team that includes GOP energy lobbyist Mike McKenna and outspoken climate change skeptic Myron Ebell   both sides now see their fortunes reversing amid Trump s promise to rescind Obama s signature Clean Power Plan and jump-start oil, and natural gas projects. I think 80 percent of President Obama s policies will be reversed very soon after Trump moves into the White House,  Robert McNally, the president of the Rapidan Group, the energy consulting firm, and former official in the George W. Bush administration, told FoxNews.com.  The Trump administration will reverse the global warming principles enacted under Obama and he will stop the politicization of infrastructure. This will definitely spur on the growth of the oil and gas industries. Here are three projects that could be revived soon after Trump takes office in January:Keystone XL PipelineOne of the biggest environmental flashpoints of Obama s presidency, the pipeline s final phase   which would create a shorter route for American and Canadian crude oil coming from Alberta to Nebraska   was rejected by Obama for not serving  the national interests of the United States. Keystone XL faced stiff opposition from environmental groups and a minority of U.S. lawmakers amid concerns of oil spills in highly sensitive ecological terrain and worries from the Environmental Protection Agency about large increases in greenhouse gas emissions from Alberta s carbon intensive oil sands.Throughout his campaign Trump vowed to  immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline    adding he believed it would have no environmental impact and would create hundreds of jobs   and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky is already pressing the president-elect to make it a priority in his first 100 days.If I am elected President I will immediately approve the Keystone XL pipeline. No impact on environment & lots of jobs for U.S.  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 18, 2015Reviving CoalCoal production has been on the wane for a number of years as Americans move toward cheaper, cleaner alternatives like natural gas and the industry struggles to cope with tighter environmental regulations imposed by the Obama administration.Saving the coal industry is part of Trump s 100-day action plan and, although he has not given any specifics so far, his campaign trail promises included rescinding the EPA s Clean Power Plan and the Mercury and Air Toxics Rule.Trump s campaign promises of reviving the coal industry helped him win over voters in places like Wyoming, West Virginia and other states hard hit by declining production of the energy source. Now as he readies to enter the White House, many of the voters are looking to see when   and, maybe more importantly, how   the incoming president will fulfill that promise.Trump has not weighed in on the issue, but Sarah Palin   Alaska s former governor who is rumored to be on Trump s short list for Interior Secretary   helped ease the path for what would be one of the world s largest open pit mines by appointing mining industry officials to lead her Department of Natural Resources and embracing resource extraction.Offshore Drilling in the AtlanticThe Obama administration recently moved to restrict drilling in waters off the Eastern Seaboard from 2017 to 2022, but environmentalists, fishermen and those in the East Coast s tourism industry want to make that restriction permanent before Trump comes into office.Despite his vocal stance on U.S. energy independence and support of increased oil and gas development, Trump s stance toward offshore drilling in the Atlantic has been vague   saying only that he backs it when  done responsibly    but if he green-lights drilling in the Atlantic it would make him many friends in U.S. oil and gas companies and could open the possibility to expand drilling other U.S. waters.Obama, however, could prevent this by invoking an obscure section of the 1953 Outer Continental Shelf Act that would make it difficult, maybe impossible, for future presidents to reverse the ban. He has used the act before to safeguard parts of Alaska s Bristol Bay and parts of the Arctic. That s the big question,  David Goldston, the director of government affairs at the Natural Resources Defense Council, told FoxNews.com.  Will the Obama administration go beyond the five-year ban? While a permananet ban is still in question, late last week Obama blocked the sale of new oil and gas drilling rights in the Chukchi and Beaufort seas north of Alaska for the next five years   a move that was praised by enviromentalists and largely scorned by oil industry represenatives. Once again, we see the attitude that Washington knows best   an attitude that contributed to last week s election results,  Randall Luthi, president of the National Ocean Industries Association, told The Assocuated Press in reference to Trump s surprise victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton.

       " 'When Republicans examined why they lost the 2012 Presidential Election, leadership concluded that they needed better outreach to groups such as women and African-Americans. And it s not going well.As it turns out, the Republican National Committee began by hiring some black employees to head up the outreach program in order to bring more black voters to the party.But as Donald Trump soars in popularity among white supremacists and gets ever closer to capturing the Republican nomination, the national director of African-American Initiatives at the RNC appears to have decided to throw in the towel on that effort to work for Maryland Governor Larry Hogan instead.In a statement to Huffington Post, Kristal Quarker-Hartsfield failed to mention why she chose to leave the RNC, saying only that she enjoyed her time working there and praised Reince Priebus as a good leader. I have thoroughly enjoyed my time at the RNC. she said. It has been an honor to work for Chairman Priebus during an exciting time in politics. It has been exciting to have a front row seat to a national Republican movement to maintain the House and win back the Senate. Chairman Priebus is an innovative leader who empowers his team, and serves my Party as a humble servant leader. It could merely be a coincidence that Quarker-Hartsfield just happens to be abandoning her post at a time when it s likely the racist Trump has destroyed just about every effort the GOP has tried to attract minority voters.But when you consider that three other black staffers have jumped ship over the last few months, it becomes less of a coincidence and more of a sign.Huffington Post reports:Quarker-Hartsfield joins several other staffers of color who have departed the RNC recently. Orlando Watson, communications director for black media, left earlier this month. Tara Wall and Raffi Williams, son of Fox News political analyst Juan Williams, both left their press positions at the RNC late last year.Though Williams denies that he left the RNC because of Trump or the racist rhetoric that has taken over the GOP, one can t help but wonder if it bothers him and the other black staffers on any level.Clearly, the RNC is experiencing problems reaching out to minority voters and Trump is making that effort even more difficult as Hispanics, women, African-Americans, and Muslims have all been targeted by Trump supporters and Trump s nasty rhetoric.It certainly appears that with Trump in the lead, some black staffers at the RNC just didn t want to waste their time trying to reach out to voters because it is kinda hard to convince minority voters that your party isn t racist when a racist has been all but crowned as the Republican nominee. It also makes one wonder how these staffers could be Republicans in the first place. Featured image via Flickr',\n",
       " 'After a business meeting before the Miss Universe Pageant in 2013, a Russian participant offered to  send five women  to Donald Trump s hotel room in Moscow, his longtime bodyguard told Congress this week, according to three sources who were present for the interview.Two of the sources said the bodyguard, Keith Schiller, viewed the offer as a joke, and immediately responded,  We don t do that type of stuff. The two sources said Schiller s comments came in the context of him adamantly disputing the allegations made in the Trump dossier, written by a former British intelligence operative, which describes Trump having an encounter with prostitutes at the hotel during the pageant. Schiller described his reaction to that story as being,  Oh my God, that s bull -,  two sources said.The conversation with the Russian about the five women took place after a morning meeting about the pageant in Moscow broke up, two sources said.That night, two sources said, Schiller said he discussed the conversation with Trump as Trump was walking back to his hotel room, and Schiller said the two men laughed about it as Trump went to bed alone. Schiller testified that he stood outside Trump s hotel room for a time and then went to bed.One source noted that Schiller testified he eventually left Trump s hotel room door and could not say for sure what happened during the remainder of the night.Two other sources said Schiller testified he was confident nothing happened.Schiller said he and Trump were aware of the risk that hotel rooms in Moscow could be set up to capture hidden video, two sources said.Schiller was grilled about the Moscow trip as part of four hours of testimony before the House Intelligence Committee. The questioning around the Moscow trip took a significant amount of time, the sources said. Schiller was also asked about the June 2016 meeting at Trump Tower between Donald Trump Jr. and Russians, two of the sources said. He testified that he did not recall much about that day. A White House lawyer familiar with the matter said that the White House  and fair-minded people are pleased that Mr. Schiller was able to debunk yet another of the false claims in the fantasy dossier funded by the DNC and the Clinton campaign and prepared during a time its foreign author worked closely with paid Russian operatives. A Navy veteran, Schiller worked part-time as a bodyguard for Trump while still an NYPD officer. He began working for Trump full-time after his retirement from the force in 2002 and became his director of security in 2004. He served as director of oval office operations in the Trump White House from January until September.  NBC News',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Fifty prominent Republican national security officials, including a former CIA director, on Monday called party nominee Donald Trump unqualified to lead the country and said he would be “the most reckless president in American history.” The statement was the latest repudiation of Trump’s candidacy by veteran Republican national security specialists, and was remarkable for the harshness of its language. “Mr. Trump lacks the character, values, and experience to be president. He weakens U.S. moral authority as the leader of the free world. He appears to lack basic knowledge about and belief in the U.S. Constitution, U.S. laws and U.S. institutions, including religious tolerance, freedom of the press, and an independent judiciary,” the statement said. “None of us will vote for Donald Trump,” said the statement, which noted that some signatories also have doubts about Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton. “From a foreign policy perspective, Donald Trump is not qualified to be president and commander in chief,” said the statement, which was first reported in the New York Times. “Indeed, we are convinced that he would be a dangerous president and would put at risk our country’s national security and well-being.” The signatories, some of whom worked for more than one Republican president, included former Central Intelligence Agency Director Michael Hayden, who also headed the National Security Agency; former Homeland Security Secretary Michael Chertoff; former Director of National Intelligence John Negroponte; and two former U.S. trade representatives, Carla Hills and Robert Zoelick. Other signatories included former senior State Department, Pentagon and National Security Council officials who helped plan and oversee the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq. Trump has harshly criticized the Iraq operation, although when radio host Howard Stern asked him in 2002 if he favored invading Iraq, Trump said he guessed he did. The statement was organized by Philip Zelikow, who served as a top adviser to former Secretary of State Condoleezza Rice. Trump responded with a statement deriding the signatories as members of “the failed Washington elite” who “deserve the blame for making the world such a dangerous place.” “These insiders – along with Hillary Clinton – are the owners of the disastrous decisions to invade Iraq, allow Americans to die in Benghazi, and they are the ones who allowed the rise of ISIS,” he continued, using an acronym for the Islamic State militant group. The statement did not cite specific comments by Trump, but it clearly was a response to a series of remarks he has made questioning the need for NATO, expressing admiration for Russian President Vladimir Putin, calling for a temporary ban on immigration by Muslims, and inviting Russia to hack Clinton’s private email server - which he later said was a joke. Many of the signatories had declined to sign an open letter disputing Trump’s national security qualifications that was published in March. The statement said many Americans are frustrated with the federal government’s failure to solve domestic and international problems. “But Donald Trump is not the answer to America’s daunting challenges and to this crucial election,” the statement said. “We are convinced that in the Oval Office, he would be the most reckless President in American history. Some Democratic foreign policy experts called the statement a reminder of the divisions the New York real estate developer’s nomination has sown within the Republican Party. “This letter is signed by those who remain in the internationalist wing of the party – many were former advisors to candidates who lost the primary fight to Trump,” said Brian Katulis, a fellow at the Center for American Progress and a Clinton campaign adviser. “Calling Trump unqualified to be commander in chief is tough, but also asserting that he’s lacking in character and understanding of our basic values is really pretty amazing,” said Tommy Vietor, a former National Security Council spokesman in Democratic President Barack Obama’s administration. “That said, I think it’s unlikely to influence many voters, but it could give cover to Republican members of Congress and donors who want to cut the cord and move on from Trump.” (For the complete statement go to: here) ',\n",

       " 'After the passing of conservative Supreme Court Justice Antonin Scalia, Republicans have been refusing to even welcome any possibility of a replacement. They don t seem to care that President Obama is bound by the Constitution to nominate someone. And considering Obama istill is, and will be the president for almost another whole year, Republicans are also bound by the Constitution to consider the nominee.Throwing this very obvious fact back in their Republican faces is none other than Senator Elizabeth Warren from the great state of Massachusetts. She said it is  shocking  that they are unwilling to entertain the idea of a new Justice clearly caving to those on the extreme right. However, also noting that this refusal to do their job  is not new. Warren stated in a scathing rebuke of their incompetence: The message from Senate Republicans is crystal clear: Forget the Constitution. Their response to one of the most solemn and consequential tasks that our government performs, the confirmation of a Supreme Court justice, will be to pretend that that nominee and President Obama himself simply do not exist. Cannot see them. Cannot hear them. Then pointing out how it has been the goal of Republicans to block pretty much everything President Obama has want to accomplish since his first day in office, Warren says: Since the first day of the Obama presidency, Republican senators have bowed to extremists who reject his legitimacy and abuse the rules of the Senate in an all-out effort to cripple his administration and to paralyze the federal courts. Warren slams them for going against the oath they swore to uphold the Constitution of the United States. She goes on to say: Republican extremists aren t voting against individuals based on a good-faith judgment about a specific person. No, they are blocking votes wholesale in order to keep those jobs vacant and undermine the government itself. Driving the point home, she says:No matter how much it damages the nation, no matter how much it undermines the courts, no matter whether it cripples the government or lays waste to our Constitution, Senate Republicans do pretty much everything they can to avoid acknowledging the legitimacy of our democratically elected president For too long, the Republicans in the Senate have wanted to have it both ways: They want to feed the ugly lies and nullify the Obama presidency while also claiming that they can govern responsibly Candidates motivated by bigotry and resentment, candidates unable to govern, candidates reflecting the same extremism that has been nursed along for seven years right here in the United States Senate, are on the verge of winning the Republican party s nomination for president If it is true that some Republican senators are finally ready to stand up to the extremism that denies the legitimacy of this president and of the Constitution, I say to you, do your job Vote for a Supreme Court nominee. Warren also made sure all those unconstitutional Republicans sitting in front of her new that President Obama was elected in 2008 and 2012 by an overwhelming democratically elected majority, and by nominating someone for the Supreme Court, he is fulfilling the will of the people.However, here s the nail in the coffin: If you want to stop extremism in your party, you can start by showing the American people that you respect the president of the United States and the Constitution enough to do your job.

       " 'BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts police do not have the authority to detain illegal immigrants solely to buy time for federal law enforcement officials to take them into custody, the state’s top court ruled on Monday. The decision amounts to a rejection of requests by the federal Immigration and Customs Enforcement agency for courts and law enforcement agencies to hold illegal immigrants, who are facing civil deportation orders, in custody for up to 48 hours after their cases are resolved. The Supreme Judicial Court ruled that doing so amounts to a fresh arrest of the person that is not authorized by state law, in the first such ruling to apply to an entire state, according to Massachusetts’ attorney general. “Massachusetts law provides no authority for Massachusetts court officers to arrest and hold an individual solely on the basis of a Federal civil immigration detainer, beyond the time that the individual would otherwise be entitled to be released from State custody,” the court wrote in its decision. The case focused on Sreynuon Lunn from Cambodia. Federal officials said he entered the United States as a refugee in 1985 and was ordered deported to Cambodia in 2008 after a series of criminal convictions. Cambodia declined to accept him and he was released. Lunn was arrested in Boston last year on an unarmed robbery charge and ordered released in February after prosecutors failed to present a case. Federal ICE officials took him into custody while he remained in his holding cell, an event that made his case moot. The court agreed to hear the case on the premise that the issue would come up again. The U.S. Justice Department had argued that the 48-hour detainer requests reflected basic practices of cooperation between various law enforcement agencies. Attorneys for Lunn and the state had largely agreed that Massachusetts lacked the authority. “This decision allows local law enforcement to focus their resources on keeping people safe,” said Massachusetts Attorney General Maura Healey, in a statement. U.S. President Donald Trump has made cracking down on illegal immigration a top priority of his administration. The American Civil Liberties Union of Massachusetts praised the decision.    “At a time\\xa0when the Trump administration\\xa0is pushing aggressive and discriminatory immigration enforcement policies, Massachusetts is leading nationwide efforts by limiting how state and local law\\xa0enforcement assist,” the group’s executive director, Carol Rose, said in a statement. ICE did not immediately respond to a request for comment. ',\n",

At least one person was killed and many others injured after a car hit a crowd of anti-fascist protesters in an alley way off a the high street.Controversial right-wing coalition Unite the Right gathered on Saturday to protest to the planned removal of a statue of the Civil War Confederate General Robert E. Lee from a local park. They were met by hundreds of  counter-protesters  from extremist left-wing Antifa  antifascist  group who descended on the event. State riot police reinforcements and the Virginia National Guard were called into to quell any unrest, although it s clear they had no control over crowds   and numerous reports indicate that police actually stood down and allowed violence to take place. As police began to disperse protesters, hundreds of Antifa agitators were then funneled into the surrounding streets.

       " 'Huma Abedin, Hillary s right hand woman, told in testimony that she burned Hillary s schedules in a  burn bag  during her tenure as Secretary of State. Even though the experts in this field are saying burning your schedule has never been done before, is their any doubt that this is just more underhanded secrecy from Hillary Clinton? Federal Records Act anyone? I ve never seen anyone put their schedule in the burn bag   because every one of them had a state.gov email address and therefore their daily schedules became public records, as required by law. Huma Abedin, Hillary Clinton s longtime aide, testified last week that her boss burned her schedules while serving as secretary of state.  If there was a schedule that was created that was her Secretary of State daily schedule, and a copy of that was then put in the burn bag, that   that certainly happened on   on more than one occasion,  Abedin told lawyers representing conservative watchdog group Judicial Watch, according to the New York Post. While Clinton admitted to deleting personal emails from her homebrew server, this is the first time anyone in Clinton s State Department inner circle admitted to destroying public records while on the job.The  burn bag  is used to discard sensitive or classified documents. A former State Department employee told the New York Post it was unprecedented for a diplomat to handle schedules this way.  I spend eight years at the State Department and watched as four U.S. ambassadors and two secretaries of state shared their daily schedules with a variety of State Department employees and U.S. officials,  Richard Grenell, a former diploma and U.S. spokesman at the United Nations told the Post.  I ve never seen anyone put their schedule in the burn bag   because every one of them had a state.gov email address and therefore their daily schedules became public records, as required by law,  Grenell added. Others who the newspaper talked to suggested the carefulness in how she discarded her schedule highlighted her carelessness when it came to using a private email server.  The president s schedule was not classified but it was deemed  highly sensitive,  noted Brad Blakeman, a scheduler for President George W. Bush.

       " 'Two high profile black people giving commencement speeches at predominately black universities with two very different messages. One speaker delivered a message of hope, humility and encouragement. The other speaker delivered a message of racism, hate, resentment and a call to stand up and fight against the oppressive white man who spends his time looking for a reason to discriminate against them.Dillard University s 218 members of the Class of 2015 received a special treat in addition to their diplomas   Academy and Tony Award-winning actor Denzel Washington to deliver the keynote commencement address. And in contrast to the whiney, racial and excuse-driven address delivered by first lady Michelle Obama at another historically black university, Washington s was filled of hope, humor, inspiration and love of his creator.  No. 1,  he resolutely told the graduates of the New Orleans university,  Put. God. First! Washington told the class that God has kept him centered throughout his life, I ve been protected, I ve been directed, I ve been corrected. I ve kept God in my life and it s kept me humble,  he said.  I didn t always stick with him, but he s always stuck with me. Stick with him in everything you do.  Toward the end of his brief address, he gave some sage advice.  I pray that you put your slippers way under your bed tonight, so that when you wake up in the morning you have to get on your knees to reach them,  Washington said.  And while you re down there, say,  thank you. Thank you for grace, thank you for mercy, thank you for understanding, thank you for wisdom, thank you for parents, thank you for love, thank you for kindness, thank you for humility, thank you for peace, thank you for prosperity. Say  thank you  in advance for what s already yours. True desire in the heart for anything good is God s proof to you, sent beforehand, to indicate that it s yours already,  Washington said.  Don t just aspire to make a living,  he concluded,  aspire to make a difference.

       " 'This is the definition of insanity-doing the same thing over and over. We just need a Congress strong enough to stop the madness.For over 30 years, sovereign nations, particularly in the West have been buying votes by offering social payments in the form of welfare.The ridiculousness of this should not be lost on anyone. Politicians, in order to be elected, promise to allocate taxpayer funds on social programs that will benefit said taxpayers down the road (we re simply talking about social spending, not infrastructure or other costs).The concept that taxpayers might simply just keep the money to begin with never enters the equation. And because everyone believes that they are somehow spending someone else s money, they play along.When you believe that you are spending someone else s money, it s very easy to write a blank check, which is precisely what Western nations have been doing for years, promising everyone a safe and secure retirement without ever bothering to see where the money would come from.When actual bills came due to fund this stuff, Governments quickly discovered that current tax revenues couldn t cover it  so they issued sovereign debt to make up the difference.And so the bond bubble was created.The large banks, that have a monopoly on managing sovereign debt auctions, were only too happy to play along with this. The reasons are as follows:1) They can use these alleged  risk-free  assets as collateral to backstop tens of trillions worth of derivatives trades. A $1 million investment in your typical US Treasury can backstop over $15 million worth of derivatives if not more. The profits from the derivatives markets remains a primary source of revenue for the banks.2) Sovereign Governments are only too happy to bail out the big banks if the stuff ever hits the fan on the trades that are backstopped by the sovereign debt (see 2006 onwards). Since the banks are the ones holding the sovereign debt, they can always threaten to dump bonds, which would render the whole social welfare Ponzi bankrupt (see what happened in Europe when sovereign bonds collapsed in 2011-2012).3) In a debt-based financial system such as the current one, sovereign bonds are the senior most assets in the system. Those who own these in bulk are at the top of the financial food chain in terms of financial, economic, and political clout.Since it was rarely if ever a problem to issue sovereign debt, Governments kept promising future payments that they didn t have until we reach today: the point at which most Western nations are sporting Debt to GDP ratios well north of 300% when you consider unfunded liabilities (the social spending programs mentioned earlier).Now, cutting social spending is usually considered political suicide (after all, the voters put you in office in the first place based on you promising to pay them welfare payments down the road). So rather than default on the social contract made with voters, the political class will simply push to issue MORE debt to finance old debt that is coming due.The US did precisely this in the fourth quarter of 2014, issuing over $1 trillion in new debt simply to pay back old debt that was coming due.Read more: Zero Hedge',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Unions in the United States face sweeping changes to labor law and regulations under a new Republican administration that is expected to tilt policy toward employers.     Republicans will take control of the presidency and both chambers of Congress in Tuesday’s elections, after unions failed to deliver key industrial states to Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton. Clinton’s loss could have wide-ranging consequences for unions. Donald Trump and a Republican-led Senate will likely pick the next justice for the Supreme Court, which often hears labor-related cases.  “I think it’s going to be a very difficult period,” said Lee Saunders, president of the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees, who said he was surprised by the election outcome despite knocking on doors and talking to members in several states.  Among his concerns, he listed a Supreme Court case this year in which public-sector unions scored a victory related to funding organized labor – but only because the court deadlocked 4-4. The appointment of a new conservative judge by Trump to replace the late Justice Antonin Scalia could change that. Republican nominees will control the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB), which under Democratic President Barack Obama has sought to make it easier for unions to organize. The NLRB is pursuing litigation to establish that McDonald’s Corp is a “joint employer” of workers at its franchised restaurants, a determination that could compel the company to bargain with unions representing employees of its independent franchisees.  Republicans will control federal agencies that govern the formation of unions, overtime rules and more. For example, in September the Obama administration finalized an executive order requiring federal contractors to provide sick leave to workers, as well as rules expanding the types of data employers are required to provide on pay. A separate Labor Department rule expanding which employees are eligible for overtime pay is scheduled to take effect next month. Those actions drew criticism from business groups, and all could be reversed under a Trump administration. “We don’t have a firewall now,” said Tom Buffenbarger, a prior president of the International Association of Machinists and Aerospace Workers who campaigned for Clinton.  Trump has expressed support for so-called right-to-work legislation, which allows workers to avoid paying union dues. Republican leaders in Congress have consistently sought such a change at the national level. Labor unions say such laws are aimed at undermining collective bargaining and workers’ rights. William Gould, chair of the NLRB under Democratic President Bill Clinton and now a professor at Stanford Law School, said on Wednesday that Trump was likely to partner with Congress in dismantling a host of administration labor initiatives from Obama.  Republicans “regard unions as first amongst fair game” because of their support for Clinton, he said. Steven Bernstein, a partner at law firm Fisher Phillips, which represents employers, said the Trump administration and Congress may also target recent NLRB rulings that allowed workers to picket on private property, expanded the type of worker activity protected by federal labor law and gave graduate students the right to unionize. “It’s also fair to assume that Trump will be inclined to repeal a host of executive orders supporting unions,” particularly rules that apply to federal contracts, Bernstein said in a statement. Organized labor is a key Democratic constituency – contributing everything from volunteers to votes for Democratic candidates. Trump nonetheless carried union-heavy states such as Pennsylvania, Ohio and even Michigan, home to the United Auto Workers (UAW).  In Ohio, for example, a Fox exit poll said Trump won 52 percent of union workers. An exit poll from ABC News suggested Clinton got no advantage among union households, even after Obama won those voters by 23 percentage points. (abcn.ws/2eUMxpx) (fxn.ws/2eULxS8) David Lephart, a 58-year-old UAW pipefitter at a General Motors Co plant in Marion, Indiana, voted for Trump. He earns about $100,000 a year, with overtime, he says, and has put both of his kids through college.  He said union leaders pressed hard for members to support Clinton, but the union has nOt kept its promises to workers in recent years. “I don’t have a tendency to believe what you tell me — when you haven’t fulfilled the promises you’ve made,” he said. UAW President Dennis Williams in a statement on Wednesday said, “we have high hopes that elected officials heard the American people loud and clear about trade, jobs, education and the inequality in this country.” ',\n",
       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s agreement with the European Union over key Brexit terms still leaves major issues like freedom of movement undecided, some campaigners said on Friday. Prime Minister Theresa May and EU Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker unveiled an agreement earlier on the Irish border, citizens  rights and the Brexit bill, opening the way for talks on trade and a transition period. While the status of the EU s only land border with the United Kingdom was perhaps the thorniest issue, the deal safeguarding the rights of 3 million EU citizens in Britain and around 1.2 million Britons living elsewhere in the EU will affect households across the continent. London and Brussels agreed to offer equal treatment in social security, health care, employment and education and to let British judges ask the European Court of Justice to weigh in when necessary for eight years after Brexit. But Jane Golding, who heads British in Europe, a coalition of 10 citizens  groups representing around 35,000 Britons living in the rest of the bloc, said fundamental issues had not been dealt with.   The really big one is free movement, and we are worried that that is just simply going to be deferred until the next phase,  Golding, a Briton who has lived in Berlin for nine years, told Reuters.  In future, if you don t have the right of free movement, the right to go and work and live in those other countries and have your qualifications recognized in those other countries, you could be passed up for those opportunities, and that s going to impact your career,  she said. EU and British officials say that British citizens on the continent will, as things stand, only have rights in the member state they are living in on the day of Brexit.  However, the two sides are prepared to negotiate further on this next year.  Britain, for example, had earlier offered a lifetime guarantee of residence rights but that is, for the time being, off the table, with people losing those rights if they leave the country for five years. However, that is an area where both sides may continue to look for tradeoffs.  Getting a deal that works is crucial to both Britain, the world s sixth-largest economy, and the EU, the world s biggest trading bloc. Britons hold positions in major businesses across the continent and take advantage of overseas study schemes such as Erasmus, while tens of thousands of elderly people rely on EU agreements for access to public services and their pensions in countries such as Spain. EU citizens fill key roles in Britain s state-run health service, construction sector and many professional jobs, with British business leaders keen to retain unfettered access to the continent s labor market. Nicolas Hatton, co-chair of campaign group the3million, said he was unhappy that the deal backed Britain s stance of making EU citizens apply to remain in the country.  All EU citizens here will need to apply to stay, while so far we were granted residents  rights,  he told Reuters.  This application process will be made with the Home Office and with the current hostile environment policy ... We are very worried. There will be errors, there will be mistakes, people will be affected by these mistakes,  he said. Responding to fears of overly bureaucratic barriers, Friday s joint report from the negotiators emphasized that the process for applying to remain will be as transparent and easy as possible.   Application forms will be short, simple, user-friendly and adjusted to the context of the Withdrawal Agreement,  it reads. But Britons in the EU face uncertainty as to what the process may involve in different member states, while Europeans in Britain have complained about the need to fill in an 85-page application form for residency and to produce tax returns and provide details of their movements over the last five years.  At an early morning media conference in Brussels, May offered reassurance to Europeans:  They will be able to go on living their lives as before,  she said. ',\n",
       " '21st Century Wire says In a stunning turn of events 11 days before the 2016 presidential election, the FBI announced it is reopenning its investigation into Hillary Clinton s email server case, by probing newly emerging emails linked to Hillary Clinton.  NEW PROBE    The FBI gives Hillary Clinton a second look. (Photo illustraion 21WIRE)FBI October Surprise?According to reports, in a letter written today, FBI Director James Comey, stated that the FBI has begun a new probe into Hillary Clinton related emails once again. Comey offered scant details about the new probe, but due to an unrelated case, additional classified material may have been mishandled on Clinton s personal email server.CNBC reported the latest FBI developments, including a passage from Comey s letter discussing the new investigation: In previous congressional testimony, I referred to the fact that the Federal Bureau of Investigation (FBI) had completed its investigation of former Secretary Clinton s personal email server. Due to recent developments, I am writing to supplement my previous testimony,  Comey wrote.In connection with an unrelated case, the FBI has learned of the existence of emails that appear to be pertinent to the investigation. I am writing to inform you that the investigative team briefed me on this yesterday, and I agreed that the FBI should take appropriate investigative steps designed to allow investigators to review these emails to determine whether they contain classified information, as well as to assess their importance to our investigation,  he added.Although the FBI cannot yet assess whether or not this material may be significant, and I cannot predict how long it will take us to complete this additional work, I believe it is important to update your Committees about our efforts in light of my previous testimony,  Comey concluded. Huma s Estranged  Sexting  HusbandAccording to a new report released via The New York Times: The presidential campaign was rocked on Friday after federal law enforcement officials said that emails pertinent to the now-closed investigation into Hillary Clinton s private email server were discovered on a computer belonging to Anthony D. Weiner, the estranged husband of a top Clinton aide. In a letter to Congress, the F.B.I. director, James B. Comey, said the emails had surfaced in an unrelated case, which law enforcement officials said was an F.B.I. investigation into illicit text messages from Mr. Weiner to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. Mr. Weiner, a former Democratic congressman from New York, is married to Huma Abedin, the top aide. Comey has come under fire recently for apparently letting Clinton off the hook for mishandling, and lying to Congress, about classified emails coming through her  home brew  email server while she was Secretary of State. After previously closing the case, Comey has done a U-turn and is now saying the FBI will review the new emails to for classified information, and see whether it was mishandled.This unprecedented investigative move comes just two days after a Wikileaks docu-dump revealed a memo containing detailed financial information between Clinton Foundation donors and former president Bill Clinton s private financial activities. Among those included in the memo, was a $30 million dollar business arrangement under  Bill Clinton, Inc.,  with another $66 million dollar deal scheduled over nine years.The following is a tweet from Brad Jaffy of NBC Nightly News containing the new FBI recommendation The new investigation into the Clinton camp will most certainly spark new  Pay-to-Play  allegations, as the new FBI revelations also comes days after a Project Veritas hidden camera sting operation revealed that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, discussed ways to commit  large-scale  voter fraud as well as paying political agitators to cause violence at Donald Trump rallies.Out of Creamer s 342 visits to the White House, also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman, Jan Schakowsky some 47 times.White House visitor records show that Schakowsky took 47  private meetings with Obama or his senior staff, also over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, possibly in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The impetus of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics  thus giving a political campaign or political entity plausible deniability.  CAUGHT ON FILM    Robert Creamer resigns over a massive Democratic Party controversy. (Image Source: CNN)Creamer, a convicted felon, (in 2005, Creamer plead guilty $2.3 million in bank fraud and tax violations) was promptly shoved out of the Hillary Clinton campaign s inner circle,  following a heavily publicized video sting revealing his discussion about voter fraud and violence at Trump rallies. PAY TO PLAY?    Virginia Governor Terry McAuliffe closely allied with the Clinton s negotiated a a campaign contribution involving the FBI. (Image Source new republic)It remains unclear what exactly reopened the new Clinton probe, but perhaps the FBI had its own cobwebs to clear out after it was revealed that a longtime Clinton associate, Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe,  helped steer $675,000 to the election campaign of the wife of an FBI official who went on to lead the probe into Hillary Clinton s use of a private email system, according to a report. The NY Post also reported on the matter this past week: The political action committee of McAuliffe, the Clinton loyalist, gave $467,500 to the state Senate campaign of the wife of Andrew McCabe, who is now deputy director of the FBI, according to the Wall Street Journal.The report states Jill McCabe received an additional $207,788 from the Virginia Democratic Party, which is heavily influenced by McAuliffe.The money directed by McAuliffe began flowing two months after the FBI investigation into Clinton began in July 2015. Around that time, the candidate s husband was promoted from running the Washington field office for the FBI to the No. 3 position at the bureau. In a CNN report from October 18th, a week before the McAuliffe revelations,  According to notes from interviews conducted during an FBI investigation into Clinton s email practices, Undersecretary of State Patrick Kennedy personally tried to convince FBI officials that the email should be declassified. One interviewee described feeling  pressured  by another FBI official at Kennedy s request. The newly reopened FBI investigation into Clinton could be related to all or some of the items listed above, but there s no doubt that due to public backlash the FBI received following the first Clinton investigation, in addition to concerns over dealings between the FBI and Clinton associates   the agency needed to save face.It remains to be seen how new case will impact the US Presidential election.More from RT below (Image Source: youtube)FBI reopens Clinton investigation as new emails found   ComeyRTThe FBI has learned of more emails involving Hillary Clinton s private email server while she headed the State Department, FBI Director James Comey told several members of Congress, telling them he is reopening the investigation.

They went on to discuss clues in the case that point to collusion between the DC police and the DNC. The most shocking information comes at the 4:20 mark when Wheeler says this:Rod Wheeler:  Here s one other thing that is going to be startling I m just gonna say this right now. I reached out to the police department way back in March when the family first hired me right..to get involved. I didn t hear anything from the police department for 2-3 days.Guess what I learned yesterday from the family of Seth Rich? The police department did not call me back because someone, a high ranking official at the DNC check this out a high ranking official at the DNC when I called the police department, they got that information and called the Rich family wanting to know, why was I snooping around? The plot thickens in this case. Will we finally find the murderer of this young man and who is behind it?IN CASE YOU HAVEN T SEEN UPDATES ON THIS CASE:CONFIRMED BOMBSHELL: SETH RICH Sent Over 44,000 DNC Emails To Journalist, Best Friend Of Wikileaks Founder DC Police Officer Claims They Were Told To  Stand Down  On Case [VIDEO]Wow! The private investigator hired by the Rich family to look into the death of 27-year old murdered DNC staffer Seth Rich just revealed some stunning evidence. It s been confirmed that over 44,000 emails and over 17,000 attachments were sent to the now deceased investigative journalist and best friend of Wikileaks founder Julian Assange. Now that this new information has been made available to the public, will the media be asking Hillary or the DNC any questions about their involvement in Rich s death? Will the DOJ be opening an investigation into his death in light of this new stunning evidence? What about the alleged Russian hack of the DNC emails that the media tried to tie to President Trump?Just two months shy of the one-year anniversary of Rich s death, FOX 5 has learned there is new information that could prove these theorists right.Rod Wheeler, a private investigator hired by the Rich family, suggests there is tangible evidence on Rich s laptop that confirms he was communicating with WikiLeaks prior to his death.Now, questions have been raised on why D.C. police, the lead agency on this murder investigation for the past ten months, have insisted this was a robbery gone bad when there appears to be no evidence to suggest that.Wheeler, a former D.C. police homicide detective, is running a parallel investigation into Rich s murder. He said he believes there is a cover-up and the police department has been told to back down from the investigation. The police department nor the FBI have been forthcoming,  said Wheeler.  They haven t been cooperating at all. I believe that the answer to solving his death lies on that computer, which I believe is either at the police department or either at the FBI. I have been told both. When we asked Wheeler if his sources have told him there is information that links Rich to Wikileaks, he said,  Absolutely. Yeah. That s confirmed. Wheeler also told us,  I have a source inside the police department that has looked at me straight in the eye and said,  Rod, we were told to stand down on this case and I can t share any information with you.  Now, that is highly unusual for a murder investigation, especially from a police department. Again, I don t think it comes from the chief s office, but I do believe there is a correlation between the mayor s office and the DNC and that is the information that will come out [Tuesday].The Democratic National Committee staffer who was gunned down on July 10 on a Washington, D.C., street just steps from his home had leaked thousands of internal emails to WikiLeaks, law enforcement sources told Fox News.A federal investigator who reviewed an FBI forensic report detailing the contents of DNC staffer Seth Rich s computer generated within 96 hours after his murder, said Rich made contact with WikiLeaks through Gavin MacFadyen, a now-deceased American investigative reporter, documentary filmmaker, and director of WikiLeaks who was living in London at the time.  FOX5DCHere is the tweet announcing the death of Gavin MacFayden only weeks before the U.S. presidential election:Gavin Macfadyen was mentor to Assange (and his closest friend in London), to WikiLeaks\\' Sarah Harrison, Joseph Farrell and many others.  WikiLeaks (@wikileaks) October 23, 2016 I have seen and read the emails between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  the federal investigator told Fox News, confirming the MacFadyen connection. He said the emails are in possession of the FBI, while the stalled case is in the hands of the Washington Police Department.The revelation is consistent with the findings of Rod Wheeler, a former DC homicide detective and Fox News contributor and whose private investigation firm was hired by Rich s family to probe the case. Rich was shot from behind in the wee hours, but was not robbed. My investigation up to this point shows there was some degree of email exchange between Seth Rich and Wikileaks,  Wheeler said.  I do believe that the answers to who murdered Seth Rich sits on his computer on a shelf at the DC police or FBI headquarters. The federal investigator, who requested anonymity, said 44,053 emails and 17,761 attachments between Democratic National Committee leaders, spanning from January 2015 through late May 2016, were transferred from Rich to MacFadyen before May 21.

       " 'VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s shift to the right in a parliamentary election has paved the way for young conservative star Sebastian Kurz to become the next leader and opened a path for the resurgent far right to return to power. The People s Party, which named 31-year-old Foreign Minister Kurz its leader only in May, secured a clear victory on Sunday with a hard line on immigration that left little space between it and the anti-Islam Freedom Party (FPO). But Kurz was still well short of a majority and only two other parties won enough seats to give him control of  parliament in a coalition. An alliance with the FPO is far from certain, but it is the most likely outcome. That prospect prompted guarded expressions of concern from European leaders including Germany s Angela Merkel, who said the FPO s strong showing was a  big challenge  for other parties in Austria. Kurz has been careful to avoid saying which coalition partner he might favor. He has said any partner must be pro-European, without saying whether that rules out the FPO, which is critical of the bloc but no longer argues against membership.  The (election) result is above all a clear victory for the European Union, it is a clear victory for us as a pro-European force,  Kurz told Reuters. His party s manifesto calls for a smaller European Commission and a streamlined EU that focuses on  core competences  such as internal trade and securing the bloc s external borders. But he declined to be drawn on specific plans. Austria was a gateway into Germany for more than a million people fleeing war and poverty in the Middle East and elsewhere during Europe s migration crisis which began in 2015.  It also took in more than one percent of its population in asylum seekers that year. Many voters feel the country was overrun then. Austria s shift to the right came after German voters last month punished Merkel s open-door policy for migrants, pushing her conservative bloc to its worst showing since 1949 and putting the far-right AfD party in parliament.  The FPO was founded by former Nazis in the 1950s and went from minnow to political heavyweight in the 1990s under the charismatic Joerg Haider, who praised Hitler s employment policies. It was one of the first far-right parties to enjoy mainstream success in Europe since World War Two.  When the FPO went into government in 2000 with the conservative party Kurz now leads, the rest of the European Union reacted with outrage and imposed sanctions on Austria . The FPO is now a sister to France s National Front and the AfD. Though on course to be one of the world s youngest leaders, Kurz is a relative veteran in government. He entered cabinet as a secretary of state for integration six years ago and has been foreign minister for the past three. He made immigration his core issue, arguing against his own coalition government s decision to throw open Austria s borders in lock step with Merkel s Germany during the migration crisis. That helped cement his reputation as a polished straight talker and make him the country s most popular politician. Kurz called an end to a coalition with the Social Democrats, prompting Sunday s election, and the two sides are at loggerheads, making a tie-up with the FPO more likely.  The race between the FPO and Chancellor Christian Kern s Social Democrats was too close to call after Sunday s count, leaving it to postal ballots   roughly a sixth of all votes cast   to tell them apart. The bulk of those ballots were expected to be counted on Monday. The FPO was ahead on Sunday but pollsters  projections showed postal ballots swinging the vote against it, as they did in last year s close-fought presidential election. With most postal votes counted, the Social Democrats had taken the lead and were ahead by 2,540 votes, with both parties on 26.6 percent, Interior Ministry data showed on Monday night.   We are not yet in the phase of coalition talks,  said Kurz, adding that he would await Thursday s final result. If the FPO had came second, it would have improved its odds of going into government with Kurz, since the Social Democrats would only consider a  coalition of losers  with the FPO if the far-right party were the junior partner. In June the Social Democrats lifted a self-imposed ban on coalitions with the FPO that had been in place for 30 years, implicitly recognizing the difficulty of forming governments without a party on course to secure more than 26 percent of Sunday s votes. After decades in parliament, the Freedom Party has sought to become increasingly mainstream, purging its ranks of overt anti-Semitism and even openly courting Jewish voters, with limited success. World Jewish Congress President Ronald Lauder, who was the U.S. ambassador to Austria from 1986 to 1987, called for the FPO to be kept out of government.  It is sad and distressing that such a platform should receive more than a quarter of the vote,  Lauder said in a statement.      ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - In backing Roy Moore in Alabama’s U.S. Senate race even though the candidate faced allegations of sexual misconduct with teenage girls, President Donald Trump made a risky bet - and lost big.  The victory by Democrat Doug Jones over the Republican Moore in the Alabama special election on Tuesday was a catastrophe for Trump, portending a Democratic wave next year that could cost Republicans control of one or both houses of Congress. The stakes in Alabama were that high. Democrats already were confident they had a strong chance to retake the U.S. House of Representatives in next year’s congressional elections. Jones’ narrow victory increases their once-long odds of retaking control of the Senate as well. If Democrats were to recapture both chambers, they would serve as a check on Trump’s agenda and might even initiate impeachment proceedings against him.  “That Republicans lost in one of the most Republican states in the nation is a wake-up call no matter how flawed their candidate was,” said Jesse Ferguson, a Democratic strategist and former aide to Democrat Hillary Clinton’s presidential campaign.  Democrats never expected to have a chance in Alabama, where they had not won a U.S. Senate race in 25 years. But the combination of Trump’s unpopularity, the sexual misconduct allegations that erupted against Moore in November, and Trump’s enthusiastic support of him anyway gave them the opportunity, experts said. “Trump was the one who got Jones within firing range, and Moore allowed Jones to win,” said Kyle Kondik, a political analyst at the University of Virginia. Even as Democrats lost several special congressional elections this year, they consistently showed higher levels of turnout and engagement, which is attributable to Trump, Kondik said.   The Alabama race showed there were limits both to Trump’s endorsement power and his judgment.  Even as senior Republicans urged Trump to abandon Moore, the president decided instead in the campaign’s final days to throw the full weight of his office behind him. In the end, that was not enough, and early turnout reports suggested that many Republicans stayed home.  Moreover, despite the sexual misconduct allegations against Moore, the race near the end increasingly seemed to become about the president. Moore’s camp this week said the contest was specifically a referendum on Trump and his presidency.  “It is Donald Trump on trial in Alabama,” Dean Young, a strategist for Moore, told ABC News. Trump congratulated Jones on Twitter “on a hard fought victory” and added: “Republicans will have another shot at this seat in a very short period of time.” The loss was also a body blow to Steve Bannon, Trump’s former top strategist, who backed Moore in the primary against the Republican incumbent, Luther Strange, because he viewed Moore as a more reliable ally. Bannon also frequently characterized the race as less about Alabama and more about furthering Trump’s economic nationalist agenda. Bannon is looking to wage an insurgency against the Republican establishment in the 2018 congressional elections, particularly Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, who condemned Moore after several women accused him of unwanted sexual contact when they were in their teens and he was in his 30s. Moore, 70, has denied the allegations, and Reuters has not independently verified them. ANTI-ESTABLISHMENT Beyond Moore, Bannon is supporting anti-establishment candidates such as Kelli Ward in Arizona, Danny Tarkanian in Nevada and Kevin Nicholson in Wisconsin, all of whom oppose McConnell staying on as Senate leader.  Bannon also may ultimately support challenges against sitting Republicans in Mississippi and Wyoming. But Moore’s loss seems certain to dampen that effort, and Republicans who fear losing control of Congress may be even less likely to back outsider candidates who may turn off mainstream voters.  It is now an open question whether Trump will inject himself into more Republican primaries, given his setback in Alabama. “When you nominate candidates who are unqualified and an embarrassment to the party, you run the risk of ruining your entire brand,” said Josh Holmes, a Republican consultant and close ally of McConnell.  Bannon’s supporters say rank-and-file Republican voters are more likely to blame McConnell, not Bannon, for the loss in Alabama, arguing that McConnell and his well-resourced Senate Leadership Fund did nothing to help Moore. McConnell “actively opposed the Republican candidate in Alabama and threatened our Senate majority by helping to put a liberal Democrat in that seat,” said Andy Surabian, a former Bannon protégé who now advises a pro-Trump advocacy group, Great America Alliance. Even with the Alabama win, Democrats face a significant challenge next year if they are to take control of the Senate. They must defend 10 incumbents in states that were won by Trump and they must gain two seats currently held by Republicans. Their best opportunities to secure those seats lie in Arizona and Nevada, and perhaps Tennessee. Democrats need 24 seats to retake the House, but that is viewed as a more realistic goal because of the number of congressional districts where they are competitive, particularly in suburban areas.  Brian Walsh, president of another pro-Trump group, America First Policies, said Trump could not be blamed for Moore’s loss, arguing that the president’s late endorsement almost won the race for Moore, a deeply flawed candidate. “He was trying to push a boulder up a hill,” Walsh said.

       " 'HONG KONG (Reuters) - Hundreds of Hong Kong soccer fans booed and jeered the Chinese national anthem at an Asia Cup qualifier match on Tuesday in defiance of Communist Party rulers in Beijing. The booing of the anthem,  The March of the Volunteers , has become a fixture at football matches in the Chinese-ruled territory, with some parallels to protests in the United States where American football players have knelt during the national anthem, an act denounced by U.S. President Donald Trump. Now the former British colony is preparing to introduce a law that will penalize people who boo the anthem, a measure that critics say undermines the city s autonomy and freedoms guaranteed when it returned to China 20 years ago. Details of the law, including jail terms and the scope of enforcement, have yet to be set. China extended the law to cover Hong Kong earlier this month. Chinese President Xi Jinping in recent years has ushered in new legislation aimed at securing the country from threats both within and outside its borders, besides presiding over a sweeping crackdown on dissent and free speech.  Chinese officials have said the anthem law is necessary to safeguard the authority of the state. Several hundred fans greeted the anthem before the match against Lebanon with jeers and boos, with some unfurling banners that said  Die for Hong Kong , while others yelled  We are Hong Kong  in English, rather than the local Cantonese dialect.  Some security guards signaled to the supporters to behave.   I m not scared even if it becomes law ... I will go to the toilet instead of sitting when the national anthem is on,  Hong Kong supporter Bendter Chong said when asked if he would continue to jeer the anthem when the law is enacted.  Tensions between Hong Kong and mainland China have increased in recent years amid calls for greater democracy. Mass street protests in 2014 paralyzed parts of the city although they failed to secure concessions on electoral reform from Beijing. Most of the jeering was from youths, underscoring how the younger generation has become increasingly disaffected by political tension and economic hardship.  Security was tight at the Hong Kong Stadium, the venue for the city s annual Rugby Sevens tournament, where about 10,000 gathered for the match. The stadium has capacity for 40,000. The game ended Lebanon 1, Hong Kong 0.  I m not sure about the law, but for sure people will be more behaved,  said Hong Kong supporter Fai Chan.  But it is still a matter of whether it is worth our respect.  Hong Kong returned from British to Chinese rule in 1997 under a  one country, two systems  arrangement that guarantees a high degree of autonomy, including an independent judiciary and freedom of expression. In 2015, Hong Kong football fans booed the Chinese anthem during a World Cup qualifier, prompting a fine for the Hong Kong Football Association from world body FIFA. The association was warned by the Asian Football Confederation recently over the conduct of fans and said  a repeat violation may result in more severe punishment . ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A draft of President Donald Trump’s new counterterrorism strategy demands that U.S. allies shoulder more of the burden in combating Islamist militants, while acknowledging that the threat of terrorism will never be totally eliminated. The 11-page draft, seen on Friday by Reuters, said the United States should avoid costly, “open-ended” military commitments. “We need to intensify operations against global jihadist groups while also reducing the costs of American ‘blood and treasure’ in pursuit of our counterterrorism goals,” states the document, which is expected to be released in coming months. “We will seek to avoid costly, large-scale U.S. military interventions to achieve counterterrorism objectives and will increasingly look to partners to share the responsibility for countering terrorist groups,” it says. However, it acknowledges that terrorism “cannot be defeated with any sort of finality.” Michael Anton, spokesman for the White House National Security Council, said, “As part of its overall approach, the administration is taking a fresh look at the entire U.S.  national security strategy, to include the counterterrorism mission - which is especially important since no such strategy has been produced publicly since 2011.” The process is aimed at ensuring “the new strategy is directed against the pre-eminent terrorist threats to our nation, our citizens, our interests overseas and allies,” Anton said. “Moreover, this new strategy will highlight achievable and realistic goals, and guiding principles.” Combating Islamic extremism was a major issue for Trump during the 2016 presidential campaign. The draft strategy paper,  which officials said was still being fine-tuned at the White House, describes the threat from Islamic militant groups in stark tones.      It remains to be seen how Trump can square his goal of avoiding military interventions with ongoing conflicts involving U.S. troops in Iraq, Syria, Afghanistan, Yemen and elsewhere. Rather than scale back U.S. commitments, he has so far largely adhered to former Obama administration plans to intensify military operations against militant groups and granted the Pentagon greater authority to strike them in places like Yemen and Somalia. Trump may soon reverse years of Obama-ordered drawdowns in Afghanistan. His administration is now considering boosting by 3,000 to 5,000 soldiers the 8,400-strong U.S. contingent helping Afghan forces fight a resurgent Taliban, current and former U.S. officials say. A senior administration official noted that only a small number of troops have been added to U.S. forces in Iraq and Syria under Trump, at the discretion of his military commanders.  “If you do see additions elsewhere, they will be in keeping with this (draft) strategy,” said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The increased pace of U.S. military operations has seen a recent spate of American casualties. The latest came in Somalia, where a Navy SEAL died and two others were wounded in an attack by al Shabaab militants, U.S. officials said on Friday. Since President Barack Obama released the last U.S. counterterrorism strategy in 2011 before the emergence of Islamic State, the threat has “diversified in size, scope and complexity from what we faced just a few years ago,” the draft strategy said. In addition to Islamic State, the United States and its allies are endangered by a reconstituted al Qaeda, groups such as the Haqqani network and Hezbollah, as well as from homegrown extremists radicalized online, it said. Bruce Hoffman, director of Georgetown University’s Center for Security Studies and who reviewed the document at Reuters’ request, said the draft strategy “paints - and I think accurately - a more dire picture” of the threat than the Obama document, which sounded a “triumphalist” tone following al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden’s death in a 2011 U.S. raid in Pakistan. The senior administration official said the document describing an overarching counterterrorism approach is separate from a detailed strategy to defeat Islamic State that Trump also has ordered.  The draft strategy seen by Reuters appears to flow from Trump’s “America First” foreign policy calling for foreign aid cuts and more burden-sharing by allies and alliances such as NATO. It does not include a signature phrase from Trump’s 2016 campaign, “radical Islamic terrorism.” Instead, it says that jihadist groups “have merged under a global jihadist ideology that seeks to establish a transnational Islamic caliphate that fosters conflict on a global scale.” The draft’s first guiding principle is that the United States “will always act to disrupt, prevent and respond to terrorist attacks against our nation, our citizens, our interests overseas and our allies. This includes taking direct and unilateral action, if necessary.” The administration would boost U.S. homeland security by working with allies and partners to eliminate terrorist leaders, “ideologues, technical experts, financiers, external operators and battlefield commanders.” The draft also calls for denying militants physical and online sanctuaries in which to plan and launch attacks and “degrade their efforts to develop and deploy” chemical and biological weapons. Yet it provides few details on how the United States, which has led global counterterrorism efforts since the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks, can achieve those goals by passing more of the burden to other countries, many of which lack the requisite military and intelligence capabilities. The draft makes little mention of promoting human rights, development, good governance and other “soft power” tools that Washington has embraced in the past to help foreign governments reduce grievances that feed extremism. In contrast, the Obama counterterrorism strategy made “respecting human rights, fostering good governance, respecting privacy and civil liberties, committing to security and transparency and upholding the rule of law” the foremost of its guiding principles. “Soft power has a role to play, but not to the exclusion of kinetics,” or military action, said Hoffman. He called the draft “a very sober depiction of the threat and what is needed now and in the immediate future to counter it.” ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Former U.S. Vice President Joe Biden on Monday left the door open to a presidential run to challenge Republican President Donald Trump in the 2020 election and said he is focused now on boosting Democrats in the 2018 midterm races. Biden, who will turn 75 on Nov. 20, declined to seek the Democratic nomination for last year’s presidential election in the wake of his son’s death. He told NBC’s “Today” show in an interview that he was not yet ready to enter a political contest. “I honest to God haven’t made up my mind about that,” said Biden, who is promoting his memoir on Beau Biden, who died in 2015 from brain cancer. “Right now I want to focus on the book and I want to focus on winning the off-year elections. “I’m not closing the door,” said Biden, who added that he was in good health. But if he had to act right now, “I would say no because I am just working through a whole lot, I’m getting there and I want to focus on the book.” Biden served as vice president under Democratic former President Barack Obama for two terms but stood aside as the party nominated former Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who lost to Trump last year. Biden had sought the Democratic presidential nomination for the 1988 and 2008 elections. Biden, who represented Delaware in the Senate for 36 years, has long given voice to the working class. Although he campaigned for Clinton, he also has been critical after the Democrats’ loss in 2016, which gave Republicans control of the White House in addition to their hold Congress. Biden has criticized Trump in recent weeks, saying he “does not understand governance” and did not take a strong stand against white supremacists after a deadly rally in Charlottesville, Virginia, in August.

       " 'Torture is illegal in this country and the United States is bound by the United Nations and the Geneva Convention to not commit such a war crime.But Donald Trump intends to sign an executive order that would open the door for the CIA to use torture on detainees and reopen secret  black sites  that are used to make people disappear.According to the New York Times, the  sweeping executive order would clear the way for the Central Intelligence Agency to reopen overseas  black site  prisons, like those where it detained and tortured terrorism suspects before former President Obama shut them down. Republicans have been defending the use of torture since it was revealed that former President George W. Bush authorized waterboarding during his presidency. It s a form of torture that simulates drowning. Even Senator John McCain says that waterboarding is torture. He would know. He was tortured in Vietnam while Trump dodged the draft and spent his days womanizing and spending his daddy s money.Most tellingly, conservatives who say waterboarding isn t torture, like Trump propagandist Sean Hannity, cowardly refuse to be waterboarded themselves even though they claim it s not torture.The only thing standing in Trump s way is a 2015 law that Republicans can easily repeal now that banned American officials from torturing detainees.Of course, it really doesn t matter what the law is since Trump will likely ignore it anyway like he ignores everything else such as facts and reality.The United States Constitution expressly forbids the use of cruel and and unusual punishment. Furthermore, torture does not work as an information gathering technique because the victim will say anything to make the torture stop. So if the CIA tortures an innocent person, they would get false information no matter what they do. And such bad information is a threat to the lives of our soldiers in the field and can lead to disastrous decisions by government. This country should not be making decisions based on what a torture victim is telling their torturer.Using torture also opens the door for other nations to use torture against us and we would be no better than the nations that currently do use it.Donald Trump is not making America great. He s an embarrassment who is only weakening this country every single day he is allowed to continue being president. Our power and reputation in the world is becoming a joke that nations like Russia and China are laughing at because our loss is their gain. America is not only losing international prestige and respect, we are being destroyed from within as Trump continues to take a jackhammer to the foundation of this country, which will destroy lives both inside and outside our nation.Resistance to Donald Trump s regime is no longer enough.

       " 'Officially, history will record President-elect Donald Trump as having won the 2016 presidential race in Michigan by some 10,704 votes.But Dr. Jill Stein, the Green Party s presidential candidate in the 2016 election, believes that the numbers would be different if all 4.8 million votes cast in the Wolverine State were recounted.That won t happen, Stein conceded in a rally in downtown Detroit on Saturday, a day after the non-recused members of the Michigan Supreme Court ruled, by a 3-2 margin, against Stein s appeal, leaving the candidate with no recourse. We may be moving out of the court of law, but we re moving into the court of public opinion,  Stein said.The rally lasted about 40 minutes in freezing temperatures, and attracted dozens of the candidate s supporters. It took place near the foot of a street named ceremonially for Congressman John Conyers, Washington Boulevard. Bell, a Green Party member who helped supervise the vote-counting effort at Cobo, became emotional several times during her brief remarks, during which she called the election system in Michigan  a flaming hot mess,  a language Stein would herself adopt. Even if the results of the 2016 election won t change, and even if there won t be a full recount in Michigan, Stein said, the state needs election reform.Bell called out voting irregularities she d learned of, like how a polling place in Ionia County allegedly used a garbage can as a ballot box, or one in Gibraltar that sealed a ballot box with mere duct tape, or a precinct in Detroit that tabulated 300 votes but only 50 were found in the box. Hot mess! Hot mess!  Bell said before handing the microphone to Stein. Count every vote, and make sure every vote counts,  Stein said.  This dysfunction in our elections flows downhill. It flows to communities that do not have resources The equipment that s used is prone to break. And it s not just the 87 scanners that failed in Detroit on Election Day. What raised a  red flag  in Michigan, Stein said, was the 75,000 ballots cast without also making a choice in the presidential race. MLive',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A U.S. Senate tax-cut bill, differing from one in the House of Representatives, was expected to be unveiled on Thursday, complicating a Republican tax overhaul push and increasing skepticism on Wall Street about the effort. As the House tax committee worked on its bill, members of the Senate weighed new approaches to corporate taxes, deductions for state and local taxes and the estate tax on inherited assets, senators said, providing few details. John Cornyn, the No. 2 Senate Republican, told reporters that senators would be briefed on the bill on Thursday before its release.  House and Senate Republicans are working on separate plans for the biggest overhaul of the U.S. tax code since the 1980s. President Donald Trump and his House allies have proposed slashing the corporate tax rate to 20 percent from 35 percent, one of the costliest features of the wide-ranging House plan. The tax overhaul is a priority for Trump, who says it will boost economic growth and create jobs. Republicans have yet to score a major legislative win since he took office in January, although they control Congress as well as the White House. Democrats have blasted the proposals in the Republican tax legislation as giveaways to large corporations and the rich. Senator Orrin Hatch, chairman of the tax-writing finance committee, told reporters he would prefer not to delay a corporate tax cut by a year, which some lawmakers said was a possibility. “I’d prefer to get it done,” he said. Financial markets have rallied since Trump’s stunning election victory in November 2016, partly on expectations that he and Congress would slash taxes on businesses. Stock markets closed little changed on Wednesday, with investors focused on chances for a tax bill becoming law. “I do think there’s disappointment with Republicans kicking the tax bill around. ... Some of the things leaking out are not encouraging,” said Bucky Hellwig, senior vice president at BB&T Wealth Management in Birmingham, Alabama. The latest version of the House bill would add $1.7 trillion to the federal deficit over 10 years, said the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, which tallies the costs of legislation. That would violate a rule requiring the legislation to add no more than $1.5 trillion to the deficit. But Representative Kevin Brady, Republican chairman of the House tax committee, said he would revise the legislation on Thursday to bring it into compliance.  A report from the nonpartisan Tax Policy Center think tank said the biggest tax cuts would go to high-income households under the current bill, which would raise taxes on more than one in four taxpayers by 2027 because of the expiration of certain benefits including a $300 family credit,  Top earners with incomes of more than $730,000 would get 21 percent of the benefits in 2018 and nearly 50 percent in a decade, the report said. The House bill would repeal a tax deduction Americans can now take for state and local income and sales taxes, but preserve it for business owners. It would cap the deduction for state and local property tax paid at $10,000.  Republican Senator David Perdue told reporters the Senate bill could repeal the entire state and local tax (SALT) deduction, a concern for people in heavily Democratic high-tax states such as California, New York and New Jersey.    Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer of New York said victories for Democrats in state elections on Tuesday should be a warning to Republicans. “The Republicans should look at the elections last night, and it should be a giant stop sign for their tax bill,” Schumer said. There are enough Republicans from high-tax states in the House to torpedo the tax bill, given that Democrats broadly oppose it. Republicans, who have a slim 52-48 majority in the Senate, also may need support from Democrats to pass their version. The House and Senate must agree on a single version before it can be sent to the president. Republican Senator Susan Collins, whose vote is crucial, declined to say if the Senate bill would duplicate the House’s proposed estate tax repeal. But she told reporters: “It’s certainly true that I expressed reservations about having complete repeal.”   A Washington tax expert raised concern about a House provision to create a 25 percent tax rate for “pass-through” businesses, saying it would do little to help small business and be vulnerable to abuse. Pass-through businesses, which include mom-and-pop enterprises and large private companies, are not organized as publicly traded corporations. Profits are passed through to their owners as individual income and taxed at rates as high as 39.6 percent. Steven Rosenthal, a senior fellow at the Tax Policy Center, said the new pass-through rate “would add great complexity” and “provide plenty of opportunity for clever investors and business owners ... to game the system.” In addition, a proposed 20 percent excise tax meant to discourage foreign companies from shifting U.S. profits offshore “appears dead,” said Chris Krueger, an analyst at financial firm Cowen’s Washington Research Group. The tax was amended by the House committee after complaints from multinational companies. “Now, the one real safeguard in the plan ... is all but gone,” said Clark Gascoigne, deputy director of the FACT Coalition, a liberal tax activist group in Washington.

       " 'HARARE (Reuters) - Zimbabwe takes its next step into the post-Mugabe era soon, when its new president, Emmerson Mnangagwa, names two vice presidents - appointments that will signal whether he is breaking with the country s old guard. Mnangagwa, whose sacking as vice-president triggered the removal of Robert Mugabe, made no comments to the media on Wednesday before the first meeting of the ruling ZANU-PF party s bosses. Party spokesman Simon Khaya-Moyo has said he will choose his deputies either this week or later. Khaya-Moyo told reporters after the meeting that Mnangagwa assured senior party officials they would serve their full terms, comments that allayed concerns of a purge of the G40 faction loyal to Mugabe and his wife, Grace. Vice President Phelekezela Mphoko, who was considered an ally of the G40, has already been sacked from the party and his post, and some Mnangagwa supporters have called for unspecified action against G40. But the president has urged citizens not to undertake any form of  vengeful retribution . Party and government officials have refused to comment on speculation in privately owned newspapers and on social media that Mnangagwa is likely to make military chief General Constantine Chiwenga one of his deputies, as a reward for spearheading the de facto coup that ended Mugabe s rule. The new president has been criticized by some Zimbabweans and opposition parties for appointing Air Marshall Perrance Shiri as lands, agriculture and rural resettlement minister and Major-General Sibusiso Moyo as foreign and international trade minister, rather than bringing in younger candidates less associated with the Mugabe era. Finance Minister Patrick Chinamasa, who is the party s legal affairs secretary, presented a report on the economy at Wednesday s meeting, where he reiterated that the  new dispensation  in the country had brought hope and confidence in the economy, Khaya-Moyo said. Chinamasa promised in a budget speech last week to re-engage with international lenders, curb spending and attract investors to revive the economy.  Mnangagwa is under pressure to reverse the economic decline before elections next year and has vowed to focus on rejuvenating the struggling economy and creating jobs. Once seen among Africa s most promising economies, Zimbabwe now has an unemployment rate exceeding 80 percent. ',\n",

After standing in line for hours, Carr and her son finally entered the polling station.Here s what she says happened next.When my son and I voted, there were SEVEN voting  booths    these were cardboard dividers for privacy. There were seven. Think about that   there are seven of the very things that are needed to vote and look to cost about a dollar fifty, so I m sorry but I don t buy the idea I ve since heard that this was a money-saving decision. Why were there not more? But that didn t even matter because when my son and I entered, there were no other voters inside. When I walked up to the booths, there were no other voters in them and while I was voting, only my own son came to stand next to me. They were purposefully trickling people in, leaving two-thirds of the booths empty while 2000 people waited outside for hours.Thousands of others, who waited for hours to cast their vote, discovered that their party affiliation had somehow been changed on the voter registration rolls. These voters were either turned away altogether or forced to cast a provisional ballot.As Mayor Stanton also states, Arizona has long, documented history of throwing out provisional ballots. According to Stanton s letter, since 2006, Arizona officials have rejected more than 121,000 provisional ballots. That number does not include the thousands of voters who were improperly forced to vote by provisional ballot during the March 22 Presidential Preference Election.While election officials have attempted to cast blame on Independent voters, who they claim came out to vote in Tuesday s election even though they legally were barred from participating, there are two things wrong with this narrative.First, many people who have been registered democrats for years discovered that their party affiliation had been changed without their knowledge or permission.Second, the media, Arizona election officials and others also bear a large amount of blame for confusion on the part of independent voters, if they did indeed show up in record numbers at the polls. (There s no actual evidence that this even happened.)Arizona s Presidential Preference Election, which was held on March 22, is not the state s primary election.The state holds its primary election on August 30. The actual primary does not include presidential candidates. Anyone can vote in that election, including independent voters.The Presidential Preference Election is a closed election. Only registered members of a political party can participate in that election.So yes, independent voters can indeed vote in the state s primary. And no, Tuesday s Presidential Preference Election was not the state s primary. Independent voters were not allowed to participate in that election, which was consistently referred to as the  Arizona primary,  when it actually wasn t.Blaming voters for trying to vote is a disgusting tactic, especially given the confusing system and the horrifying lack of clarity from the media and election officials.Mayor Stanton spoke with KPNX on Wednesday. Watch the video below. The Phoenix mayor is not the only politician to criticize Tuesday s election fiasco. On Wednesday, Gov. Doug Ducey called the long lines and voter registration issues  unacceptable,  while also calling for changes to the state s closed Presidential Preference Election.Image credit: video screen capture via Marc Liverman on Facebook ',\n",
       " 'WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Just days after the United States said it would increase troop numbers in Afghanistan and ask its allies to do the same, New Zealand on Friday announced an extra three non-combat military personnel, boosting its military commitment to 13. U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday unveiled his strategy to end the conflict in Afghanistan, committing the United States to an open-ended conflict and signaling he would dispatch more troops to America s longest war. U.S. officials have said Trump had signed off on plans to send about 4,000 more U.S. troops to add to the roughly 8,400 now deployed in Afghanistan. U.S. Defense Secretary James Mattis has since said exact troop numbers are yet to be decided. Trump said he would ask coalition allies to support his new strategy, with additional troops and funding, to end the 16-year conflict. New Zealand Defence Minister Mark Mitchell s announcement boosting the country s Kabul-based troops to 13 follows a request for NATO (National Atlantic Treaty Organization) to send more troops to Afghanistan earlier this year. New Zealand has had troops in Afghanistan since 2001. Its presence has been decreasing since 2013 but it has kept some personnel on the ground to train local officers.  New Zealand will continue to stand alongside our partners in supporting stability in Afghanistan and countering the threat of international terrorism,  said Mitchell. Prime Minister Bill English said the government has ruled out making a decision on sending combat troops to Afghanistan before New Zealand s election on Sept. 23. Opposition leader Jacinda Ardern told local media this week she would not back sending troops to Afghanistan at the moment but was not privy to intelligence such decisions were based on. ',\n",

       " 'It s no secret that the comedic host of HBO s Real Time, Bill Maher, is no fan of religion. In fact, it s safe to say that he really pretty much hates the practice. He is one of America s most outspoken celebrity atheists, and Friday night s edition of his show saw him once again ripping religion for the amusement of his largely secular audience. What Maher had to say this time, though, wasn t just making fun of people who believe in god(s). He actually called for the Internal Revenue Service to make these institutions pay taxes.During his  New Rules  segment, Maher began: Why, in heaven s name, don t we tax religion? A sexist, homophobic magic act that s been used to justify everything from genital mutilation to genocide. You want to raise the tax on tobacco so kids don t get cancer, OK. But let s put one on Sunday school so they don t get stupid. Maher went on to say that the fact these churches owned billions in property got him, quote,  hopping mad.  He also pointed out something that likely has most religious people either panicking or in complete denial: religious belief is largely on the decline in the United States, which is traditionally seen as the most religious country in the developed western world. In fact, the youngest generation of Americans   Millennials   largely not only aren t actively religious, but they are uncomfortable with most mainstream religion, mostly due to the homophobia, misogyny, and other harmful ideas and practices therein.Maher continued on his rant: Almost a quarter of us are being forced to subsidize a myth that we re not buying into. Why am I subsidizing their Sunday morning hobby? They don t subsidize mine. After that brilliant closer, Maher flashed a photo of himself getting high with a friend on what is presumably one Sunday morning.The thing is, Bill Maher is right. We shouldn t be subsidizing churches. These people push all kinds of horrible things, including lobbying, at least indirectly, to enshrine bigotry into law against people they believe to be  sinners.  Our tax dollars should not be spent to uphold religion. People can believe what they like, but the rest of us shouldn t be paying for it.Thank you, Mr. Maher, for another hilariously brilliant   and oh so true   monologue on the truth about the tax-free status of America s religious institutions.Watch the video below, via Raw Story:https://youtu.be/Mw8MLub4siUFeatured image via video screen capture',\n",

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s announcement on Wednesday on banning transgender people from serving in the U.S. military unleashed a storm of legal threats from advocates who say they are seeking plaintiffs who want to file suit. Trump’s surprise tweets did not make clear when a ban reversing former President Barack Obama’s policy would go into effect, nor whether it applies to serving members of the military or those wishing to join. But if the U.S. Defense Department actively roots out transgender people and discharges them from the military, the Pentagon is likely to face an especially contentious fight,  legal experts say. “There’s no valid justification for excluding transgender people from the military,” said Jon Davidson, legal director for LGBT rights group Lambda Legal. “They are currently serving without a problem. There hasn’t been an extraordinary cost. There hasn’t been disruption.” Experts say singling out transgender people would violate their rights to equal protection under the law as guaranteed by the U.S. Constitution. Joshua Block at the American Civil Liberties Union said his inbox was flooded with emails about Trump’s ban, including from service members. “I think the most important thing for people to understand is that for the immediate future, nothing can happen to them ... Trump’s tweet is not self-executing,” said Block, a senior staff attorney on lesbian, gay, bisexual and transgender (LGBT) issues. Under Obama, the Defense Department declared in June 20016 that transgender people could serve openly in the armed forces. The Pentagon was considering a second step of allowing openly transgender people to enlist when Trump on Wednesday issued three tweets saying transgender people would not be allowed to serve any capacity in the military, citing disruptions and medical costs. The Pentagon referred all questions to the White House, where press secretary Sarah Huckabee Sanders said Trump made the decision in consultation with his national security team and that the Defense Department would work with the White House and take the lead on a lawful implementation.  Sarah Warbelow, the Human Rights Campaign’s legal director, said Trump’s declaration amounted to “discrimination on the basis of sex and identity,” and was therefore open to legal challenge. “The courts do provide quite a bit of deference to the military in determining its own policies,” she said. “However, that doesn’t mean the military is above the law.” But the Pentagon may have a clearer path to a ban should it merely prevent new transgender recruits from signing up. If the ban applies only to those seeking to enlist, the legal bar would be higher because the military already has wide leeway to exclude classes of people based on medical needs, Block said. If Trump did want to remove all existing transgender servicemembers from the ranks, it was unclear what legal mechanism he could use to forcibly discharge U.S. troops. If transgender people disclosed their identity as a result of the Obama policy and that policy is then changed, they would have a legal recourse should they be arbitrarily denied their jobs and benefits, Davidson said. Even those seeking to enlist might allege the government banned transgender individuals in an arbitrary way and without good reason. But at least one legal expert said a challenge would be difficult to mount because courts typically defer to the government on military matters. Eugene Fidell, who teaches military law at Yale Law School, said even if discharged transgender service members asked for military reviews of their cases and won, those decisions could be overturned by the secretaries of the four branches of the military, who are political appointees. It would difficult to convince federal courts to reverse the secretaries, Fidell said. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of U.S. members of Congress has backed a proposal for $7.5 billion of new military funding for U.S. forces and their allies in the Asia-Pacific region, where tensions have risen over China’s territorial ambitions and military buildup. Five members of the U.S. House of Representatives and eight senators from both the Democratic and Republican parties wrote to Defense Secretary Jim Mattis to support the Asia-Pacific Stability Initiative (ASPI) proposed in January by John McCain, chair of the Senate Armed Service Committee. Copies of the letters were seen by Reuters. Their signatories include members of the armed services committees in both houses of Congress. McCain’s proposal calls for $1.5 billion annually for five years to 2022 to boost U.S. munitions stocks in the region, build new military infrastructure, such as runways, and help allies and partners increase their capabilities. The House letter urged Mattis to incorporate McCain’s proposal in the fiscal 2018-22 defense budgets. “The Asia-Pacific region holds many interests for U.S. foreign policy that will require our government to continue to prioritize our time, energy and resources there,” it said. The letter called former President Barack Obama’s policy of giving precedence to the Asia-Pacific “sound” and it was “critical” that this be continued under President Donald Trump. It expressed concern about “the eroding military and economic balance that is the result of the People’s Republic of China’s two-decade military modernization, combined with the effect of years of sequestration on the U.S. military and our foreign policy apparatus.” The Senate letter also expressed concern about increasing Russian activity in the region and North Korea’s nuclear and missile programs. “ASPI will show both allies and adversaries that the U.S. remains committed to ensuring peace and security in a region that contains the world’s three largest economies, four most populous countries, six of the world’s largest armies, and five of the seven U.S. mutual defense agreements,” it said. Trump has vowed to take a tougher line with China and to build up the U.S. military, although it is unclear whether he will succeed in lifting caps on defense spending that have been part of “sequestration” legislation. China is due to announce its defense budget for this year this weekend, and its navy is likely to secure significant new funding as Beijing seeks to check U.S. dominance of the high seas and step up its projection of global power.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Nationals from seven Muslim-majority countries temporarily barred from the United States by President Donald Trump’s executive order may be blocked indefinitely, and others might be added to the list, Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly said on Tuesday. Under the order released on Friday, travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen may not enter the country for at least 90 days while Kelly and others determine whether there is enough information available to screen them. “Some of those countries that are currently on the list may not be taken off the list anytime soon, if they are countries that are in various states of collapse, as an example,” Kelly told a press conference. Kelly said others may be added if it is determined they “could tighten up their procedures” to ensure more secure vetting. Several lawsuits have been filed blocking portions of the order, which drew harsh criticism from some of Trump’s fellow Republicans, Democrats, human rights organizations and some Western U.S. allies.  Vice President Mike Pence was closely questioned about the order by Republican senators during their weekly caucus lunch. “Obviously what happened Friday, they have to understand, was not well done,” Republican Senator Bob Corker told reporters. “... There are a lot of issues here that I don’t think were well thought through.” Confusion mounted during the weekend as U.S. Customs and Border Protection, a division of the Department of Homeland Security, rushed to brief airlines and customs agents about how to implement Trump’s order. The executive action was not explicit about how to handle a wide range of people trying to enter the United States, including permanent residents, students and even Iraqi pilots training to protect U.S. troops. Acting Customs and Border Protection Commissioner Kevin McAleenan told reporters he had briefed appropriate parties “within two hours” of the order. Kelly said he knew the order was coming and “had people involved in the general drafting of it.” But a Department of Homeland Security official, speaking on the condition of anonymity, said Customs and Border Protection officers had no advance notice of the order or how to respond. Some issues were addressed on Tuesday. Kelly said people from the seven targeted nations who hold dual citizenship would be allowed to enter the United States on the passport of a non-restricted nation, which had been uncertain. The executive order also stopped the resettlement of refugees for 120 days. But the administration granted waivers to 872 “in transit” who will be arriving this week. Kelly came to the U.S. Capitol later on Tuesday to brief congressional leaders and the heads of national security committees about the order. He was peppered with questions from both Republicans and Democrats concerned about the lack of planning. Senator Claire McCaskill, the ranking Democrat on the Senate Homeland Security Committee, said Kelly made clear the White House is happy with the order, and that the administration had not wanted to wait to address details about its implementation. “It was pretty clear that the president wanted this executive order put in place, and he wanted it implemented immediately. And it’s not going anywhere,” she told reporters. Since the order, 721 travelers with visas from the seven countries were denied boarding U.S.-bound flights, according to McAleenan. The department has also processed 1,060 waivers for legal permanent residents, such as green card holders. Kelly said immigration and customs officials were in compliance with court orders and no agent knowingly or intentionally violated them. The Trump administration also sought to clarify on Tuesday that citizens of U.S. ally Israel who were born in Arab countries would be allowed into the United States. The U.S. Embassy in Tel Aviv said a valid U.S. visa in an Israeli passport would still be valid even if the passport holder was born in one of the seven countries. ',\n",
       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - Sebastian Gorka, a former adviser to U.S. President Donald Trump who quit after top White House political strategist Steve Bannon was ousted, has joined a nationalist pro-Trump campaign organization, the group announced on Tuesday. The MAGA Coalition, dedicated to helping advance Trump’s “America First” principles, said it had hired Gorka as “Chief Strategist.” MAGA is headed by Adam Gingrich, a Pennsylvania political operative who backed Trump’s presidential campaign. A MAGA statement announcing Gorka’s appointment said its mission was to “identify the obstructionists in (Washington) DC and to advocate the America First principles that catapulted Donald Trump to the White House”. It quoted Gorka, 46, as condemning “DC swamp-dwellers thinking they know better than the people they represent”.  Gorka has been an outspoken advocate of tough U.S. anti-terrorism policies and in the past asserted that U.S. efforts to counter Islamic State and other jihadist propaganda were “pin-pricks and often counter-productive”. Prior to his time on Bannon’s White House team, Gorka was national security editor at Breitbart.com, the far-right website which Bannon headed before joining the White House and then rejoined after leaving the White House last month. Gorka, the son of Hungarian refugees who was born in Britain, also previously taught classes at the U.S. Marine Corps University. While at the White House, Gorka regularly appeared on cable news shows to promote Trump’s policies. But intelligence professionals and diplomats viewed him as an ideologue who lacked real-world experience.  In late August, the conservative Federalist website published a letter from Gorka saying he was resigning from the Trump Administration. But a White House official said in a statement: “Sebastian Gorka did not resign, but I can confirm he no longer works at the White House.”      ',\n",

According to the New York Times, Kelly will be jumping ship to NBC where she will hist a daytime news and discussion program, anchor her own weekend show, and be a part of the network s special political coverage.This may or may not come as a shock to Fox, whose ousted former chairman Roger Ailes sexually harassed Kelly for about a decade, but perhaps they might be having some  hindsight  issues surrounding their recent decision to side with Trump over Kelly when The Donald was bullying her on social media, regular media, and everywhere else imaginable after she challenged him during a debate.Whatever her reason for leaving, she is passing up a pretty sweet $20 million a year that Fox offered her to stay after her current contract expires.

Sources declined to tell the New York Times what, exactly, Kelly s annual salary will be, but she is almost assuredly taking a pay cut based on past remarks.While it is entertaining to see Kelly  stick it to  Fox News, we have no choice but to wonder why NBC would hire someone who thinks that Santa and Jesus are both real (and white dudes), who blamed Sandra Bland for her own death, who thinks that pepper spray is a  food product, essentially,  and who has done and said so many horrific things over the years that a truly functional society would treat her as a pariah   though, of course, she was one of the few right-wing voices who actually stood up to Donald Trump to some degree.Naturally, Trump fans are celebrating the news:Megyn Kelly is moving to NBC!

       " 'PARIS (Reuters) - Battered and bruised from electoral defeat by Emmanuel Macron s centrists, France s Socialist Party is laying off most of its staff and selling its Paris base, while the centre-right Republicans limp on in search of a leader. Facing falling membership after winning just six percent of the vote in the presidential election, the centre-left party told staff on Wednesday it would have to fire most of them, days after its historic headquarters was put up for sale to raise funds. On the other side of the political divide, the conservative Republicans are leaderless and have struggled for months to decide whether to expel party members who have signed up to serve with Macron. The two parties ruled France for decades, but Macron s Republic on the Move has stolen the middle ground from under their feet.  Macron benefits from a large political space left vacant by the opposition,  said Vincent Thibault of Elabe pollsters.  He has to face very few attacks from the other parties.  Fewer lawmakers and local officials mean the Socialist Party s income has fallen to 8 million euros ($9.42 million) a year from 28 million previously. Party treasurer Jean-Francois Debat told Reuters around 60 of 97 staff would have to go.     While the Republicans are the largest opposition group in the lower house of parliament and hold a majority in the senate, they are in barely better shape. For the past five months they have struggled to stem Macron s poaching of their top officials, or to oppose economic policies that mirror their own. In the latest of several meetings on membership, the party decided in principle on Tuesday to expel Prime Minister Edouard Philippe and other ministers serving in Macron s government.     But having failed to gather enough officials at the meeting, they were forced to postpone the actual decision for a week, drawing scorn from critics.  It s grotesque,  Sebastien Lecornu, a junior minister and one of those facing expulsion, told Le Parisien daily.  They are punishing us for backing reforms that are useful to the country ... the right is committing suicide.       The far left and far right are also struggling to mount a credible opposition to 39-year-old Macron. The far-right National Front, weakened by its own divisions, has become close to inaudible. Its leader Marine Le Pen had the worst ratings on record for France 2 television s top political show last week, with only 1.7 million viewers. The far-left France Insoumise has been more vocal, and polls show it is seen as the strongest opponent. But it has struggled to get voters out on the streets against Macron s reforms and surveys show it is regarded more as a protest movement. ',\n",
       " 'MELBOURNE (Reuters) - Australia s embattled conservative Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull has shaken off speculation about the security of his leadership, declaring on Sunday he will lead his coalition government into the next election in 2019. Turnbull, who has faced a horror run in recent weeks, losing his one-seat majority and being called to stepdown before Christmas, said that he  runs the government  and that his party s policies would soon be converted into public support.  I have every confidence that I will lead the coalition to the next election in 2019 and we will win it,  Turnbull told Sky News television.  I am very confident we will be able to see a disciplined approach to teamwork within the coalition.     Three Australian prime ministers have been ousted by their own parties since 2010. Turnbull s confidence has been bolstered by the stunning by-election victory of his former deputy prime minister, Barnaby Joyce, who easily cruised to victory on Saturday night with a huge 65 percent primary vote. Barnaby was kicked out of parliament just over one month ago because he held dual citizenship with New Zealand, a status he has since rescinded. Under Australia s constitution dual citizens are banned from the national parliament. Barnaby s win restores Turnbull s slim one-seat majority in parliament and Turnbull, who is struggling with record low opinion polls, has claimed the victory as a vote of confidence in his performance. Turnbull has been under sustained attack for much of the year over issues including same sex marriage and the scandal-plagued banking sector, and has failed to end widespread disquiet within his coalition about his future as leader. On Friday, the conservative deputy premier of New South Wales state John Barilaro called for Turnbull to step down as a  Christmas gift  to the nation. The comment came just days after Turnbull was forced into an embarrassing policy reversal and called a Royal Commission into the country s banking and financial sector amid mounting political pressure. Turnbull has failed to stem a flow of disgruntled voters away from his conservative coalition to far-right parties and the fragility of his government has been exacerbated by a dual citizenship crisis which is forcing a number of lawmakers, like Barnaby, to recontest seats. One of those by-elections for the blue-ribbon conservative electorate of Bennelong in Sydney on Dec. 16 could see Turnbull again lose his majority in parliament if the opposition Labor achieves a surprise win.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department will require all nations to provide extensive data to help it vet visa applicants and determine whether a traveler poses a terrorist threat, according to a cable obtained by Reuters.  Countries that fail to comply with the new protocols or take steps to do so within 50 days could face travel sanctions.  The cable, sent to all U.S. diplomatic posts on Wednesday,  is a summary of a worldwide review of vetting procedures that was required under U.S. President Donald Trump’s revised March 6 executive order that temporarily banned U.S. travel by most citizens from six predominantly Muslim countries. The memo lays out a series of standards the United States will require of other countries, including that they issue, or have active plans to issue, electronic passports and regularly report lost and stolen passports to INTERPOL.  It also directs nations to provide “any other identity information” requested by Washington for U.S. visa applicants, including biometric or biographic details. The cable sets out requirements for countries to provide data on individuals it knows or has grounds to believe are terrorists as well as criminal record information.  Further, countries are asked not to block the transfer of information about U.S.-bound travelers to the U.S. government and not to designate people for travel watchlists based solely on their political or religious beliefs. “This is the first time that the U.S. Government is setting standards for the information that is required from all countries specifically in support of immigration and traveler vetting,” the cable said.  The cable can be read here: (reut.rs/2untHTl). The new requirements are the latest in a series of steps the Trump administration says it is taking to better protect the United States from terrorist attack.     However, former officials said much of the information sought is routinely shared between countries, including examples of passports and additional details about particular travelers that may present security concerns.  Some U.S. allies may worry about privacy protections if Washington is seen as seeking information beyond what is already shared, said John Sandweg, a former senior Homeland Security Department official now with the firm Frontier Solutions. “I don’t think you can ignore the political aspects of the unpopularity of the current administration. That puts political pressure to stand up to the administration,” he said. The cable lays out risk factors the U.S. government will consider when evaluating a country. Some of these are controversial and could be difficult for countries to prove to U.S. satisfaction, including ensuring “that they are not and do not have the potential to become a terrorist safe haven.” Countries are also expected to agree to take back citizens ordered removed from the United States. If they do not provide the information requested, or come up with an adequate plan to, countries could end up on a list to be submitted to Trump for possible sanction, including barring “categories” of their citizens from entering the United States. The real worries for countries may not come until the results of this review are known, said Leon Rodriguez, the former director of U.S. Citizenship and Immigration Services. “Once they start making decisions I think that is where there is going to be a lot of anxiety,” he said, saying delays in visa processing for nations that do not pose much of a threat could start to hurt “ordinary business and personal travel.” The most controversial of Trump’s immigration-related moves are two executive orders, challenged in federal court, which impose a temporary ban on travel to the United States for most citizens from Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria, and Yemen.  While the orders were initially blocked from being enforced, the Supreme Court on June 26 allowed the ban to go into effect for people from the six nations with no strong ties to the United States.  The cable requires countries to act quickly, but stressed that the United States would work with foreign nations to assess if they meet the standards and, if not, to come up with a plan to help them do so. The cable asks that U.S. diplomats “underscore that while it is not our goal to impose a ban on immigration benefits, including visas, for citizens of any country, these standards are designed to mitigate risk, and failure to make progress could lead to security measures by the USG, including a presidential proclamation that would prohibit the entry of certain categories of foreign nationals of non-compliant countries.” The cable says the U.S. government has made a preliminary determination that some countries do not meet the new standards and that others are “at risk” of not meeting them. It does not name these, listing them in a separate, classified cable. The State Department declined comment on the cable, saying it would not discuss internal communications. “The U.S. government’s national security screening and vetting procedures for visitors are constantly reviewed and refined to improve security and more effectively identify individuals who could pose a threat to the United States,” said a U.S. State Department official on condition of anonymity.

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - U.S. and Turkish troops are  illegal invader  forces on Syrian territory and Syria will  deal with  them, a top adviser to President Bashar al-Assad said on Tuesday. Bouthaina Shaaban also said in a television interview that Damascus would not give up on the northern city of Raqqa, which was liberated from Islamic State last month by the U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led Syrian Democratic Forces (SDF).  Turkey today is a colonizer country, its forces on our soil are illegal, just as the American forces are on our soil  illegally,  she told Lebanese channel al-Mayadeen.  We will deal with this issue as we deal with any illegal invader force on our lands,  she said, without elaborating. Assad s forces, helped by Russian air power and Iran-backed militias, have managed to reestablish control over most of Syria over the past two years. The United States and Turkey are backing various rebel groups opposed to both Assad and to Islamic State. Turkey has started setting up observation points in Idlib province in northwest Syria under a deal with Assad s allies, Russia and Iran. The U.S.-led coalition battling Islamic State in Syria has repeatedly said it does not seek to fight Assad s forces, though Washington and Ankara both want the president to step down. The SDF has said Raqqa will be part of a decentralized  federal Syria  and hopes for a new phase of negotiations that will shore up Kurdish autonomy in northern Syria, but last Friday a senior Iranian official said Syrian government forces would advance soon to take the city.  Everything is up to the Syrians and to discussions between Syrians, and there cannot be discussion on the division or cutting up of a part of the country or on so-called federalism,  Shaaban said. She added that what happened in Iraqi Kurdistan  should be a lesson  to the SDF, referring to Iraq s Kurdish leaders who suffered a major blow when the central government in Baghdad - backed by Iran and Turkey - retaliated against them for holding an independence referendum last month. Shaaban also said comments by the Syrian foreign minister in September, when he said Damascus was open to negotiations with the Kurds over their demand for autonomy within Syria s borders, had been misinterpreted.  I don t think any government can discuss with any group when it comes to the topic of the country s unity,  she said. Earlier on Tuesday, Assad said the army and its allies would keep fighting in Syria after it has driven Islamic State militants from their last significant stronghold in the country, in Deir al-Zor province. He also indicated that he might take the war to the SDF, which controls more than a quarter of Syria, by saying the war must target those who seek to  divide and weaken states . ',\n",
       " 'FBI Agents are coming forward now to voice their frustrations and concerns about FBI Director James Comey s inept policing of the FBI. Specifically, the Clinton email investigation was held up by Comey standing in the way. One of the specifics of the investigation that hindered it was that the Clinton house was never searched. The FBI always does a search of a household in an investigation. The New York FBI agents working the case were livid at the stonewalling in the Clinton case. FBI agents are now lawyering up and speaking up to tell what they know This is a textbook case where a grand jury should have convened but was not. That is appalling,  an FBI special agent who has worked public corruption and criminal cases said of the decision.  We talk about it in the office and don t know how Comey can keep going. DID ANYONE ELSE THINK THIS EXACT SAME THING:The agent was also surprised that the bureau did not bother to search Clinton s house during the investigation. We didn t search their house. We always search the house. The search should not just have been for private electronics, which contained classified material, but even for printouts of such material,  he said. There should have been a complete search of their residence,  the agent pointed out.  That the FBI did not seize devices is unbelievable. The FBI even seizes devices that have been set on fire. Another special agent for the bureau that worked counter-terrorism and criminal cases said he is offended by Comey s saying:  we  and  I ve been an investigator. The idea that the Clinton/e-mail case didn t go to a grand jury is ridiculous. According to Washington D.C. attorney Joe DiGenova, more FBI agents will be talking about the problems at bureau and specifically the handling of the Clinton case by Comey when Congress comes back into session and decides to force them to testify by subpoena. People are starting to talk. They re calling their former friends outside the bureau asking for help. We were asked to day to provide legal representation to people inside the bureau and agreed to do so and to former agents who want to come forward and talk. Comey thought this was going to go away. The most important thing of all is that the agents have decided that they are going to talk. Read more: Daily Caller',\n",
       " 'TRIPOLI (Reuters) - Libyan authorities are processing a request from Britain to extradite the brother of the bomber who killed 22 people in Manchester in May, but no decision has been taken yet, a government spokesman said on Thursday. The armed group holding the brother said that if the attorney general s office agreed to the request, the force would be  ready for the next step . Salman Abedi, a 22-year-old Briton born to Libyan parents, blew himself up at the end of a show by U.S. singer Ariana Grande in the deadliest militant attack in Britain for 12 years. His victims included seven children. More than 500 people were injured. On Wednesday, British police said they had issued an arrest warrant for his brother, Hashem Abedi, for murder, attempted murder and conspiracy to cause an explosion, and prosecutors had asked Libya to extradite him.  An official request has been received through the Libyan ministry of foreign affairs and the Libyan authorities are cooperating to process (the request) in accordance with Libyan legal procedures,  said Hassan al-Houni, a spokesman for the internationally recognized government in Tripoli.   No decision has been taken yet.  Days after the attack, the Special Deterrence Force (Rada), a counter-terrorism and anti-crime group aligned with the government, arrested Hashem Abedi and the brothers  father Ramadan. The father was released in August. Various armed factions in Tripoli have aligned themselves with the government, some with semi-official status for law enforcement. However, the government, which struggles to impose its authority, has limited power over them. Rada initially said it would not extradite Hashem, but then said it was ready to cooperate.  If there is agreement between the attorney general and the British authorities, we are ready for the next step,  spokesman Ahmad Ben Salim said. The Libyan attorney general s office could not be reached for comment. Islamic State said it was responsible in the immediate aftermath of the bombing but security services have always treated the claim with scepticism. In June, Rada said Hashem Abedi had told them his brother had been radicalised in Britain in 2015. They had both flown from Britain to Libya in April and Hashem said he had helped buy the equipment necessary for the attack although he had not known that Salman was planning a bombing, Rada said. British police say Salman Abedi returned to Manchester on May 18, four days before his attack. The family had emigrated to Britain during the rule of the late Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi. The brothers  parents returned to Libya during the 2011 revolution. Police have previously said they believed Salman Abedi had built the bomb himself and CCTV showed him buying nuts from a hardware store that were used as shrapnel as well as the tin that was believed to contain the explosives.

       " 'Susan Rice will not visit Capitol Hill today for a meeting with the House committee probing allegations she  unmasked  President Trump associates in Russian meddling probes.Hmmm If Democrats really wanted to get to the bottom of their  Trump-Russia collusion  witch-hunt, it would certainly make sense that Rice would be jumping at the opportunity to testify at the House hearings.Rice had been expected to face tough questions on her role in the matter while serving as then-President Barack Obama s national security adviser. Trump alleges Rice may have committed a crime by asking government analysts to disclose the names of his associates documented in intelligence reports.Fox News was initially told Rice would be giving closed-door testimony Tuesday before the Republican-led House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence.But that session has apparently been postponed.The panel is leading one of several investigations into Russian meddling in the 2016 White House race, which have engulfed the Trump administration and evolved to include questions about whether anybody on Trump s campaign team colluded with the Kremlin to defeat Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton.Ohio GOP Rep. Jim Jordan last week told Fox News that he wants Rice to answer the basic question:  Did you unmask the names and if so why? He also argued that Americans indeed deserve to know the truth about the Trump associates but they also want answers from high-ranking Obama administration officials who may have misled Americans on critical matters   including Rice, as U.S. ambassador to the U.N., saying the fatal 2012 Benghazi terror attacks were largely  sparked  by an anti-Muslim video. The American people want to get the truth on all of these issues,  said Jordan. He also raised concerns about how Obama Attorney General Loretta Lynch handled the Clinton email investigation and whether James Comey exposed classified information in an apparent effort to retaliate against Trump firing him as FBI director.Rice has denied that she did anything inappropriate, saying she was authorized as Obama s national security adviser to seek the identities of people whose names were redacted from intelligence reports.And she has suggested that her race and gender may be playing a role in the controversy, in a recent New York Magazine interview.   Fox NewsIt would be more shocking to the American people if Rice didn t use her race and gender as an excuse for committing heinous crimes against American citizens. It s the only card left in the deck for a cheating, lying and deceitful administration with their backs firmly against the wall Fox News legal anchor Gregg Jarrett said Rice is lying.

       " 'For nigh on two years now, wise people have been warning against the normalization of Donald Trump. However, the media insisted on giving him and his outrageous travesty of a campaign billions of dollars in free advertising, and refused to convey one simple fact to the American people: Donald Trump is in no way fit to president and Commander-in-Chief. In fact, he is dangerously unfit. Trump is clearly a narcissist, unbelievably vengeful and vicious, and in many ways seems to be VERY mentally unstable and unable to control his impulses. Despite these obvious traits that would make anyone unsuited to be president, America has elected him, and now we re in grave danger. The worst part of it? The media is rushing to normalize him once again, and with that normalization comes more danger than ever. Therefore no matter how much the media tells us to do so, no matter how many politicians tell us to do so, we must resist the normalization of this absolutely abnormal presidency. There s one person who is doing an amazing job of telling us just what we need to hear and understand: Keith Olbermann.On GQ s The Closer, Keith Olbermann has been busily railing Donald Trump in ways the mainstream media refuses to do. Now that Trump is the president-elect, he has come out with a brilliant video called  The Resistance  in which he explains the grave danger we are in, and why Trump must be resisted every step of the way. First, Olbermann says that he himself will help lead those of us who understand how dangerous Trump is: Since no Democratic or liberal politician has yet stepped forward out of the morass of Politics, Inc. to take on the responsibility of The Resistance, I, with complete awareness of the presumptuousness and arrogance of this statement, volunteer myself, and I will gladly turn over all these burdens to any more legitimate and informed lawmaker or political or cultural leader who has the guts to take these burdens. Then, Olbermann goes on to lay into Trump in spectacular fashion, laying out all of the reasons he cannot be accepted, and how we might go about making sure we never accept him as president: The first step is to complete the de-legitimizing of his presidency and his election. De-legitimizing that he himself began. Sixty-eight days until his inauguration, still bitching about his paranoid fantasies about the media, still lying about what he said during the campaign, still referring to himself in the third person, still obsessing over one newspaper  as if he were fifteen and it had refused to go with him to the junior prom. Give him a chance? What, in the hope that he will someday grow up enough to be able to see over the top of the Oval Office desk? Most importantly, Olbermann then reminds us all just what the people insisting we should give Trump a chance are really saying: All we are saying is, give fascism a chance.   Who knows, it might not be as bad as we think. It might not be a bottomless pit. After that, the bombastic host lays out his best zinger yet, though he is completely serious: We do not have time for the White House edition of  Celebrity Apprentice  starring President-elect P*ssy-grabber. Olbermann does warn against any crazy and/or illegal tactics, though, saying: I do not want violence, I m not proposing the overthrow of the government by any means other than legal and political. I think protests should be limited to Washington, Trump Tower and the Trump hotels. I have no pie-in-the-sky plan to have the Electoral College alter the outcome somehow, I will even acquiesce to a President Pence   just get this man out of here. Keith Olbermann is right. We need the truth here, and the truth is that this is how fascim takes over. We cannot allow Trump to become normalized, and we cannot, not for a second, treat him as any sort of legitimate president. To do so is to see the end of democracy as we know it.Mr. Olbermann, I salute you, and I proudly join your resistance to Donald Trump.Here is the must watch video, and I urge you to subscribe to the GQ YouTube channel, where  The Resistance  will be a regular series to help us all navigate the Donald Trump fascist rule.[ad3media campaign= 1356 ]Featured image via video screen capture',\n",

The reporter, April Ryan, said Manigault  physically intimidated  her in a manner that could have warranted intervention by the Secret Service.Ryan also said Manigault made verbal threats, including the assertion that Ryan was among several journalists on whom Trump officials had collected  dossiers  of negative information.Manigault, a onetime friend of Ryan s, declined to address Ryan s accusations on the record, offering only this emailed statement:  My comment: Fake news!  She did not specify what she considered false.As we have learned by now, when the Trump administration cries  fake news,  the allegations are generally true. Despite Manigault s denials, multiple witnesses confirm that the altercation did take place, with one remarking that the Trump official s actions were  Secret Serviceable,  meaning that it was a situation in which law enforcement needs to intervene.This isn t the first time Omarosa has informed the public of the Trump administration s plan to deal with those they view as enemies. In November, Manigault told the Independent Journal Review that  we re keeping a list  of people who have defied Trump. It s so great our enemies are making themselves clear so that when we get in to the White House, we know where we stand,  she said at the time.If a Trump official admitting that the administration is keeping lists of enemies and compiling  dossiers  for blackmail doesn t concern you, then there is something wrong.Featured image via Getty Images',\n",

This is the most amazing and honest letter to our Community Organizer In Chief that you will ever read. Although this letter was written in 2009, its content is surprisingly still very timely. He discusses Obama s disdain for our police, military and America in general and even addresses his warped views on race in America. Enjoy Dear President Obama,My name is Harold Estes, approaching 95 on December 13 of this year. People meeting me for the first time don t believe my age because I remain wrinkle free and pretty much mentally alert.I enlisted in the U.S. Navy in 1934 and served proudly before, during and after WW II retiring as a Master Chief Bos n Mate. Now I live in a  rest home  located on the western end of Pearl Harbor allowing me to keep alive the memories of 23 years of service to my country.One of the benefits of my age, perhaps the only one, is to speak my mind, blunt and direct even to the head man.So here goes.I am amazed, angry and determined not to see my country die before I do but you seem hell bent not to grant me that wish.I can t figure out what country you are the president of. You fly around the world telling our friends and enemies despicable lies like: We re no longer a Christian nation   America is arrogant    (Your wife even announced to the world,  America is mean-spirited.  Please tell her to try preaching that nonsense to 23 generations of our war dead buried all over the globe who died for no other reason than to free a whole lot of strangers from tyranny and hopelessness.) I d say shame on the both of you but I don t think you like America nor do I see an ounce of gratefulness in anything you do for the obvious gifts this country has given you. To be without shame or gratefulness is a dangerous thing for a man sitting in the White House.After 9/11 you said,  America hasn t lived up to her ideals.  Which ones did you mean?1. Was it the notion of personal liberty that 11,000 farmers and shopkeepers died for to win independence from the British ?2. Or maybe the ideal that no man should be a slave to another man that 500,000 men died for in the Civil War?3. I hope you didn t mean the ideal 470,000 fathers, brothers, husbands, and a lot of fellahs I knew personally died for in WWII, because we felt real strongly about not letting any nation push us around because we stand for freedom.4. I don t think you mean the ideal that says equality is better than discrimination. You know the one that a whole lot of white people understood when they helped to get you elected.Take a little advice from a very old geezer, young man. Shape up and start acting like an American. If you don t, I ll do what I can to see you get shipped out of that fancy rental on Pennsylvania Avenue. You were elected to lead not to bow, apologize and kiss the hands of murderers and corrupt leaders who still treat their people like slaves.And just who do you think you are telling the American people not to jump to conclusions and condemn that Muslim major who killed 13 of his fellow soldiers and wounded dozens more. You mean you don t want us to do what you did when that white cop used force to subdue that black college professor in Massachusetts who was putting up a fight? You don t mind offending the police calling them stupid but you don t want us to offend Muslim fanatics by calling them what they are, terrorists.One more thing. I realize you never served in the military and never had to defend your country with your life but you re the Commander-in-Chief now, son. Do your job. When your battle-hardened field General asks you for 40,000 more troops to complete the mission, give them to him. But if you re not in this fight to win, then get out. The life of one American soldier is not worth the best political strategy you re thinking of.You could be our greatest president because you face the greatest challenge ever presented to any president.You re not going to restore American greatness by bringing back our bloated economy. That s not our greatest threat. Losing the heart and soul of who we are as Americans is our big fight now. And I sure as hell don t want to think my president is the enemy in this final battle.Sincerely,Harold B. EstesHarold B. Estes and many of his peers are part of a generation that is known as  The Greatest Generation.

       " '(Reuters) - Republican White House hopeful Donald Trump is seeking $10 million in damages from a fired former employee, shedding light on a campaign that has at times seen high-profile exits and internal fights spill over into public view. Trump in May started arbitration proceedings against Sam Nunberg, a former adviser who was fired in 2015, accusing him of violating a confidentiality agreement, according to a court filing obtained by Reuters.     “He has a confidentiality agreement which he has repeatedly breached, and we’ve taken action to enforce it,” said Alan Garten, general counsel with the Trump Organization who is representing the campaign in the arbitration.  Nunberg did not respond to a request for comment. The flare-up comes after a period in which campaign in-fighting led Trump to fire some top aides, including national political director Rick Wiley and campaign manager Corey Lewandowski. Other staffers have separately resigned from Trump’s campaign. Trump’s legal conflicts, which also include a lawsuit over his Trump University real-estate seminars, have at times distracted public attention from his campaign. Nunberg in court documents dated Tuesday accused Trump of starting arbitration proceedings to retaliate against him for switching his support to rival presidential hopeful Ted Cruz during the Republican primaries. Cruz dropped out of the race in early May. Garten said the suit was unrelated. Nunberg also said Trump tried to use the arbitration to “cover up media coverage of an apparent affair” between two members of his presidential campaign staff. “The Trump campaign is attempting to bring a frivolous and retaliatory arbitration proceeding against me essentially to punish me and shut me up,” Nunberg said in an affidavit accompanying his petition to halt the arbitration proceedings.  The petition was filed on Tuesday in New York state court in Manhattan. The Trump campaign fired Nunberg in August 2015 after the discovery of Facebook posts that critics deemed racist. Nunberg at the time denied he wrote the posts. He said in the court filings that Trump accused him of being the source for a New York Post story in May that recounted a public argument between Lewandowski, who was then with the campaign, and Hope Hicks, Trump’s spokeswoman. In the affidavit, Nunberg said the argument was part of an “sordid and apparently illicit affair” between the two. He denied being the source for the New York Post story, saying the argument occurred in public and others saw it. Garten called the allegation “categorically untrue” and said Nunberg had recently asked for his job back. “This is an individual who time and time again has demonstrated that he will say anything that is outrageous, regardless of whether it’s factually accurate, to get his name out there and create trouble,” Garten said. Hicks and Lewandowski did not respond to requests for comment. ',\n",
       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - Britain s main opposition Labour Party must commit to staying in the European Union s single market after Brexit and put an end to Prime Minister Theresa May s  destructive Brexit , several of its lawmakers said on Sunday. At the beginning of the party s annual conference, Labour lawmakers and trade union leaders wrote an open letter to their leader, calling on Jeremy Corbyn to  go further  than his current position to press for being part of the single market during any transition after Britain leaves in March 2019. After months of sticking to a position little different from the governing Conservative Party s pursuit of a clean break with the EU, Labour changed tack last month by saying, if in power, the party would press for full access to the single market during a transition - something that could continue beyond.  We have watched with dismay as the government has used a narrow referendum result to justify an extreme approach to Brexit,  the lawmakers said in a letter published in Britain s Observer newspaper.  So at our conference this week, Labour should commit to staying in the Single Market and Customs Union   ruling out no options for how to achieve this.  Labour s earlier move was aimed at increasing pressure on May, weakened after losing her party s majority in parliament in a June election she did not need to call and struggling to unite her own party over Brexit. But Labour is also keenly aware that many of its supporters, especially in northern and central England, voted for Brexit and want controls on immigration which many blame for stretching public services, such as hospitals and schools. Corbyn, who says he is preparing for government, told the BBC he was listening to those members of the Labour Party who want to keep the closest possible ties with the EU, but he did not say whether he would change the party s policy. Instead, he said he believed a transitional period with full single market access should last for as long as is necessary and offered some support for continued migration. In the letter, Labour lawmakers attacked the Conservative Party s  damaging promise to cut net migration to the tens of thousands .  Labour must be clear: migrants are not to blame for falling wages, job insecurity, bad housing and overstretched public services,  the letter said. ',\n",

       " 'Has anyone seen Barack Obama lately? What about Valerie Jarrett, who actually MOVED IN to the Obama household shortly after exiting the White House? Why would Obama s 60-year old former senior advisor move into his house with his wife and daughter who is still in high school? Unless there was some obvious reason for her living with the Obama s, it makes no sense whatsoever. Why does no one in the media find this arrangement to be even remotely odd? Is it possible that Barack Obama and his evil puppet-master had something to do with orchestrating what many believe was a fake protest in Charlottesville, as a way to create hate for white people, the Right and more importantly to give Americans a reason to blame President Trump and the Republican Party for the actions of the racist groups who participated in the protests.Immediately after the violence in Charlottesville took place, President Trump took to Twitter and turned to the media to (rightfully) condemn both sides of the conflict.We ALL must be united & condemn all that hate stands for. There is no place for this kind of violence in America. Lets come together as one!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) August 12, 2017Curiously, the former president, who s been keeping a very low profile leading up to the Charlottesville protests, tweeted a response to Charlottesville. CNN called Obama s response on Twitter,  The most linked tweet in the history of Twitter.  CNN was so giddy over the response to Obama s tweet, they actually published an entire story on the success of his tweets:Former President Barack Obama s tweet reacting to the attack in Charlottesville, Virginia, is the most liked tweet ever on the social network.Obama s reaction to the Charlottesville attack is also the fifth-most retweeted behind a tweet from a teen who wanted free chicken nuggets from Wendy s, Ellen Degeneres  tweet from 2014 Oscars, a tweet from singer Louis Tomlinson to his One Direction bandmate Harry Styles and Ariana Grande s previously mentioned tweet.So, what exactly was the media s role in using the Charlottesville protests to push the false narrative that,  President Trump is a racist? Nation One News decided to do a little digging into the leader of the allegedly  White Supremacist  leader who organized the  Unite the Right  rally in Charlottesville, and here are a few very curious things they found:First of all, the ACLU defended Jason Kessler and forced the city to keep his permit in place. This was after the city raised concerns about the ability of Law Enforcement to keep Antifa, BLM, and the New Black Panthers from clashing with the White Supremacists who were attending with Jason Kessler.Here are a few things you need to know about Jason Kessler.First, he supports gun control. Second, he LOVES Obama and Clinton! Third, He LOVED the Iran deal struck by Obama!Fourth, Hates Republicans and compared them to Dahmer.Finally, he claims he was  Red Pilled  into becoming a Trump Supporter ?He claims he was  red pilled  by the  media instigating the Baltimore riots.  However, an Advanced search of his Tweets only reveals one Tweet raising questions or assigning blame for the Baltimore Riots. That Tweet was sent a month AFTER this so called  red pill  or change of heart.So who is this guy really? Well, at least some of rumors on the Internet are True, he was, in fact, a Liberal and he admitted it. His reason for changing his mind doesn t add up, based on the evidence.He has Tweeted 4843 times and he never mentioned the Baltimore Riots prior to his change of heart.One last thing.We are researching to determine if he used to work for or with CNN. CNN has not responded to our calls or emails. It is possible that another Jason Kessler worked for CNN, however, the Jason Kessler from Charlottesville have a gap in his Linked In profile from 2009 to 2013.According to SNOPES, the left wing  fact-checker  source, they ve talked to CNN, who confirms they never employed the Jason Kessler who clashed with BLM and Antifa in Charlottesville. So cased closed right?Here is what the LEFT-wing SNOPES had to say:Did Kessler write articles for CNN that were sympathetic to the Occupy movement?False. Kessler says he never worked for CNN, and we spoke to a source at CNN who confirmed it. A writer named Jason Kessler was once employed by CNN, and he did cover Occupy Wall Street protests among many other topics, but according to CNN it was not the same Jason Kessler who went on to lead Unite the Right.Except that Americans have become much less trusting of these so-called  fact-checkers  and sources they used to believe were honest about the news they reported. We no longer believe anything SNOPES or the Very Fake News CNN has to say. Jason Kessler used to run a blog called jasonkessler.net, however, the site is conveniently taken down. ',\n",
       " 'RIYADH (Reuters) - All major Gulf stock markets slid on Tuesday on jitters about Saudi Arabia s sweeping anti-graft purge, a campaign seen by critics as a populist power grab but by ordinary Saudis as an overdue attack on the sleaze of a moneyed ultra-elite. U.S. President Donald Trump endorsed the crackdown, saying some of those arrested have been  milking  Saudi Arabia for years, but some Western officials expressed unease about the possible reaction in Riyadh s opaque tribal and royal politics. Authorities detained dozens of top Saudis including billionaire Prince Alwaleed bin Talal in a move widely seen as an attempt by Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman to neuter any opposition to his lightening ascent to the pinnacle of power. Admirers see it as an assault on the endemic theft of public funds in the world s top oil exporter, an absolute monarchy where the state and the ruling family are intertwined.  Corruption should have been fought a long time ago, because it s corruption that delays society s development,  Riyadh resident Hussein al-Dosari told Reuters.  God willing, everything that happened ... is only the beginning of what is planned,  said Faisal bin Ali, adding he wanted to see  correcting mistakes, correcting ministries and correcting any injustices against the general population.  But some analysts see the arrests as the latest in a string of moves shifting power from a consensus-based system dispersing authority among the ruling Al Saud to a governing structure centered around 32-year-old Prince Mohammed himself. Investors worry that his campaign against corruption - involving the arrests of the kingdom s most internationally known businessmen - could see the ownership of businesses and assets become vulnerable to unpredictable policy shifts. Saudi banks have frozen more than 1,200 accounts belonging to individuals and companies in the kingdom and the number keeps rising, bankers and lawyers said. The authorities sought to reassure the business community late on Tuesday, with the central bank saying it was freezing suspects  personal bank accounts at the request of the attorney general but not suspending operations of their companies.  In other words, corporate businesses remain unaffected. It is business as usual for both banks and corporates,  the bank said in a statement, adding there were no restrictions on money transfers through proper banking channels. A separate statement said Prince Mohammed had directed a powerful ministerial committee, the Council for Economic Affairs and Development, to ensure that national and multinational companies, including those wholly or partly owned by individuals under investigation, were not disrupted.  The Council recognized the importance of these companies for the national economy, and the importance of ensuring that investors could operate with confidence in Saudi Arabia,  the state news agency SPA said. In Washington, Heather Nauert, spokeswoman for the U.S. State Department, said it had urged Saudi Arabia to undertake any prosecutions of corruption suspects in a  fair and transparent  manner. She said the United States had received assurances from the Saudi government that it would do so. But another U.S. official later told reporters she had misspoken and that they had no such assurances that they could discuss in public. The Saudi stock index .TASI sank 0.7 percent in heavy trade, led by shares in companies linked to people detained in the investigation.  The market, which was down 3.1 percent at one stage, would have finished much lower without apparent buying by government-linked funds seeking to prevent a panic, fund managers said. A mass pull-out of foreign funds was not apparent. Among the companies, Prince Alwaleed s Kingdom Holding 4280.SE plunged by its 10 percent daily limit, bringing its losses in the three days since the investigation was announced to 21 percent. The fall has wiped about $2 billion off his fortune, previously estimated by Forbes magazine at $17 billion. In Dubai, where Saudis have been significant investors, the index .DFMGI slipped 1.8 percent. The index in Abu Dhabi .ADI, less exposed to Saudi money, fell only 0.4 percent. But Kuwait continued to slide, its index .KWSE losing 2.8 percent.  The show of investor nerves coincided with sharply heightened strains between Riyadh and Tehran, reflected in a  fresh denunciation of adversary Iran by Prince Mohammed over its role in Yemen, and by continuing mutual acrimony over political turmoil in Lebanon, another cockpit of Iranian-Saudi rivalry. Displaying an apparently undimmed taste for navigating several challenges simultaneously, Prince Mohammed said Iran s supply of rockets to militias in Yemen is an act of  direct military aggression  that could be an act of war.  He was speaking in a phone call with the British foreign minister after Saudi forces intercepted a ballistic missile they said was fired toward Riyadh on Saturday by the Houthis. A Saudi-led coalition, which backs Yemen s internationally-recognized government, has been targeting the Houthis in a war which has killed more than 10,000 people and triggered a humanitarian disaster in one of the region s poorest countries. Iran has denied it was behind the missile launch, rejecting the Saudi and U.S. statements condemning Tehran as  destructive and provocative  and  slanders . The coincidence of heightened Saudi-Iranian tensions and Saudi domestic political upheaval has stirred unease among some Western governments and analysts about the emergence of an impromptu policy-making style under Prince Mohammed and turmoil in a region traditionally seen as a haven of stability.  He seems to be pushing the creation of a personalized system of rule without the checks and balances that have typically characterized the Saudi system of governance,  wrote Marc Lynch, professor of political science and international affairs at George Washington University, in the Washington Post.  In both domestic and foreign affairs, he has consistently undertaken sudden and wide-ranging campaigns for unclear reasons which shatter prevailing norms.   Among those held in the anti-graft purge was Prince Miteb bin Abdullah, who was replaced as minister of the National Guard, a pivotal power base rooted in the kingdom s tribes. That recalled a palace coup in June that ousted Mohammed bin Nayef, known as MbN, as heir to the throne. MbN made his first confirmed public appearance since then at the funeral for Prince Mansour bin Muqrin, deputy governor of Asir province, who was killed in a helicopter crash on Sunday. No cause has been given for the crash. A photo shared online by a state media photographer showed MbN greeting another royal at the first major family gathering since the anti-corruption sweep began. The crackdown removed any remaining political counterweights to the crown prince, according to Steffen Hertog, a Saudi scholar at the London School of Economics.  This allows for fast decision-making and reduces costly involvement of princes in state contracts, but also potentially reduces internal criticism and review of new policy initiatives,  he said. A former senior U.S. intelligence official cautioned that given the National Guard s loyalties, Prince Mohammed could face a backlash.  I find it difficult to believe that it (National Guard) will simply roll over and accept the imposition of new leadership in such an arbitrary fashion,  he said. But the purge may go some way to soothing public disgust over financial abuses by the powerful, some Saudis say.  There is no doubt that it (the detentions) soothes the anger of the regular citizen who felt that such names and senior leaders who appeared in the list were immune from legal accountability,  said Saudi-based political analyst Mansour al-Ameer.  Its spread to the general population is evidence that no one is excluded from legal accountability, and this will eventually benefit the citizen and (national) development.  ',\n",
       " 'MANILA (Reuters) - At least 26 people were killed while several residents were missing in an island province in central Philippines after tropical storm Kai-tak brought heavy rains that triggered landslides, local authorities and media said on Sunday. Kai-tak cut power supplies in many areas, forced the cancellation of several flights, stranded more than 15,000 people in various ports in the region and prompted nearly 88,000 people to seek shelter in evacuation centers. The Provincial Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Office of Biliran island said 26 residents had died, but the National Disaster Risk Reduction and Management Council (NDRRMC) has yet to make any official announcement about fatalities. Biliran Governor Gerardo Espina Jr confirmed the deaths in an interview with DZMM radio, with 23 people still missing, he said.  We received reports of three deaths coming from the DILG (Department of the Interior and Local Government) but these are for confirmation,  said NDRRMC spokeswoman Romina Marasigan.  We are still trying to check the others.  Many areas were flooded, damaging crops and infrastructure. Kai-tak has weakened to a tropical depression after  barrelling through the eastern region of Visayas on Saturday, hitting islands and coastal towns such as Tacloban City where supertyphoon Haiyan claimed 8,000 lives in 2013. Locally known as Urduja, Kai-tak was packing winds of 55  kilometers (31 miles) per hour with gusts of up to 80 km/h, according to a weather bureau bulletin issued at 2000 GMT. ',\n",

A weaponized drone/unmanned aerial vehicle (UAV)/unmanned aerial system (UAS) with a remotely detonated IED allows for a precision strike to take place against an intended target,  Robert Bunker and John P. Sullivan, the authors of the new analysis, wrote.The drone-IED combination was found in central Mexico, by federal police who did a traffic stop on a stolen pickup truck with four men in it.Police found an AK-47, ammunition, phones and what the Small Wars Journal authors said appears to be a 3DR Solo Quadcopter, which retails for about $250 online. Taped to the drone was an IED, which could be trigger by remote detonator.Mr. Bunker and Mr. Sullivan said the  dron bomba,  as they labeled it, was the next step for cartels that have been using papas bombas, or potato bombs   a roughly shaped sphere with a core of explosives and nails and other shrapnel packed inside for the most lethal reach.The analysts said several examples of potato bombs have been detected in Mexico this year.In August, U.S. Border Patrol agents nabbed a $5,000 drone and seized a $46,000 meth load in southern California, after one agent detected it flying overhead. Agents also apprehended the man assigned to pick up the load, who said he had made a number of such pickups and was paid $1,000 each time.Meanwhile, the chiefs of the FBI and National Counterterrorism Center told Congress last month that they are worried Islamic State terrorists who have pioneered weaponized drones in the Middle East will use the tactic inside the U.S. to spread a toxin or drop a grenade.

       " \"Donald Trump is no stranger to doing business in the Middle East, yet for some unknown reason, he could never quite crack the Qatar market. Sure, he had been dealing in the hotel business with the Saudis for at least two decades and has his name on quite a few golf courses in the UAE, however, no matter how hard he tried, business deals in Qatar always seemed unattainable for him.Now a feud between these three Gulf nations broke out on June 5, when Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates and Arab allies all broke off trade, travel and diplomatic relations with Qatar as punishment for what they said was its support of terrorism. Many scholars, however, believe that the fallout is the result of a struggle for power and autonomy, but it didn t take long for Trump to throw his support behind the United Arab Emirates and Saudi Arabia in the dispute; the two countries out of the three where he has business interests. Trump said his reason for backing Saudi Arabia and the UAE is that Qatar is a  funder of terror at a very high level,  but was this his only reason?The Pentagon and the State Department have a different opinion on the issue to the alleged president, with the secretaries of defence and state trying to encourage unity against a common enemy in ISIS by staying completely neutral on the topic of Qatar, but unlike Donald Trump, the Pentagon and the State Department don t have personal assets in the area. That s right, Trump is the first U.S. president in 40 years to maintain private business interests after entering the White House and many critics believe maintaining a business empire will skew the president s ability to make rational diplomatic decisions that truly are for the good of the people. Trump may have signed his business empire over to his sons at a press conference in January, but as the Director of the Office of Government Ethics warned, stepping away from management without giving up ownership does not diminish his financial incentives or conflicts Other countries in the Middle East see what is happening and may think,  We should be opening golf courses  or  We should be buying rooms at the Trump International,  said Brian Egan, a State Department legal adviser under the Obama administration.  Even if there is no nefarious intent on behalf of the president or the Trumps, for a president to be making money from business holdings in sensitive places around the world is likely to have an impact. When the trouble between Saudi Arabia, UAE and Qatar kicked off, Dana Smith, the American Ambassador to Qatar, retweeted a Treasury Department article praising Qatar for cracking down on extremist financing, which you can read below.This is so important, I'm sharing it again. Great partnership, real progress to counter terrorist financing. #Qatar https://t.co/yjnEg2IJlF  Dana Shell Smith (@AmbDana) October 26, 2016Not long after Smith s tweet, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged Qatar  to be responsive to the concerns of its neighbors,  while also adding,  We call on the Kingdom of Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt to ease the blockade against Qatar. Then there s Trump s response. He was completely in favor of the blockade the second it started, declaring on Twitter that his visit  was already paying off  and he continued to defend it even after Tillerson had called for it to be eased, saying that  The time had come to call on Qatar to end its funding  of terrorism. Remember, this is the man who said of the Saudis back in 2015 that he likes them because they buy apartments from him.  They spend $40 million, $50 million. Am I supposed to dislike them? I like them very much. It s not just the purchasing of apartments that Trump has to thank Saudi Arabia for   In 1995, Donald Trump sold the Plaza Hotel to a partnership consisting of a Saudi prince, the same prince that paid $18 million for Trump s yacht in 1991 and a Singaporean investor. This $325 million deal on the Plaza enabled Trump to escape a default on his loans.So next time you hear Trump weigh in on the Middle East, ask yourself if he is thinking of the safety of the American people or his own back pocket.Featured image via Chris Kleponis-Pool/Getty Images\",\n",
       " 'ZURICH (Reuters) - A Swiss federal court has dismissed the asylum appeal of a woman convicted in Spain of supporting the Basque separatist group ETA, but said she was now free to remain in Switzerland after Madrid dropped her sentence. The case of Nekane Txapartegi, who said she was tortured while in custody in Spain before fleeing in 2007, has drawn considerable attention in Switzerland, with members of a  Free Nekane  movement staging rallies in Zurich and other cities. The United Nations  special rapporteur on torture and Amnesty International had also urged Swiss authorities not to extradite Txapartegi to Spain. On Friday the Swiss court said the asylum issue was no longer relevant because Spain s High Court had ruled that her sentence - initially 11 years in jail, later reduced to 3-1/2 years - had reached its statute of limitations.  As with every European citizen, Ms. Txapartegi may stay in Switzerland within the rules of free movement,  a spokesman for the State Secretariat for Migration said. Switzerland is not in the European Union but EU citizens can settle there provided they are in gainful employment or can prove they have sufficient funds to support themselves. Swiss authorities arrested Txapartegi in Zurich in April 2016 after they discovered she had been living under an assumed name in Switzerland since 2009. They agreed in March this year to extradite her but freed her in September after the Spanish decision to drop her jail sentence. Txapartegi had told Swiss authorities she was tortured into confessing support for ETA while in Spanish custody. The Swiss Federal Office of Justice said at the time she  could  not credibly show that she was actually tortured . On Friday the Swiss court said that, given the conditions prevailing in Spain at the time of her arrest, she may well have been subjected to physical and psychological abuse, but said it no longer needed to evaluate her claims. ETA, which killed more than 850 people in a decades-long campaign to carve out a separate state, effectively ended its armed resistance this year when it surrendered its weapons. ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Tuesday reaffirmed support for the United States’ longstanding security alliances around the world but insisted that friends and partners from Europe to the Middle East to the Pacific must “pay their fair share of the cost.” In his first nationally televised speech to Congress since taking office on Jan. 20, Trump sought to reassure allies still uneasy over doubts he raised during the 2016 presidential campaign about his commitment to their defense and to maintaining a U.S. global leadership role. But he also made clear that he expects those countries to shoulder more of the burden of their own security needs, echoing a campaign message that some allies had taken advantage of Washington’s generosity in providing them a security umbrella. “Our foreign policy calls for a direct, robust and meaningful engagement with the world,” Trump told a joint session of Congress. “It is American leadership based on vital security interests that we share with our allies across the globe.” He specifically assured NATO allies of his new administration’s continued commitment to the decades-old alliance. However, he made no mention of one of the main sources of European concern: his friendly overtures during the campaign toward Russian President Vladimir Putin. “We strongly support NATO, an alliance forged through the bonds of two World Wars that dethroned fascism and a Cold War that defeated communism,” Trump said. “But our partners must meet their financial obligations,” he said. “And now, based on our very strong and frank discussions, they are beginning to do just that.” Then, deviating from his prepared remarks, Trump added: “In fact, I can tell you the money is pouring in. Very nice.” But he offered no specifics. Some critics had accused Trump of failing to recognize the benefit that accrued to the United States of having strong democratic allies helping to stabilize volatile areas like the Middle East, Ukraine and South Asia. Trump’s remarks followed the deployment earlier this month of senior Cabinet members to Brussels, Bonn and Munich, Germany, aimed at calming European worries. The Europeans heard from Defense Secretary James Mattis that the North Atlantic Treaty Organization military alliance was not “obsolete” after all, despite Trump’s suggestions to the contrary. Vice President Mike Pence told them that Russia would be “held accountable” for its actions in Ukraine.  Mattis made his first foreign trip to South Korea and Japan, where he sought to ease  concerns about what Trump’s self-styled “America First” strategy means for U.S. foreign policy in Asia. While seeming to tackle some of the doubts of U.S. allies, Trump still made clear that he wanted them to do more. “We expect our partners, whether in NATO, in the Middle East, or the Pacific, to take a direct and meaningful role in both strategic and military operations, and pay their fair share of the cost,” he said.

I didn t think I would get admitted to Stanford at all, but it s quite refreshing to see that they view my unapologetic activism as an asset rather than a liability,  he added.Ahmed said he included a reference to Black Lives Matter because he feels  unapologetic progressivism is a central part of my identity, and I wanted that to be represented adequately in my application.

       " '21st Century Wire says The intelligence agencies of the US and the UK were chartered to serve the government and protect national security by gathering information, analyzing data and making recommendations to government officials. At least that is how it was sold to the public in the beginning.But what do we see now? We see intelligence agencies in both the US and the UK being used to serve as a political sledge hammer in the realms of foreign policy, media subversion, disinformation operations, regime change, assassination, domestic wiretapping, full spectrum surveillance and all things dirty in the political black bag of tricks. The report below raises some major questions that citizens of the US and UK should be asking themselves about their intelligence services.Are the CIA and MI6 protecting national security at all anymore?Why are these intelligence agencies actively involved in the creation and dispersal of false documents and reports?Is their end game to subvert the inauguration a democratically elected government official in the United States?Who is cheering on these intelligence agencies?Will Trump be victorious against the intelligence apparatus?One thing is certain: no functioning democracy can survive for long if its intelligence agencies feel they are more important than our elected officials  Consortium News Exclusive: President-elect Trump is in a nasty slugfest with U.S. intelligence agencies as they portray him as a Russian tool and he blasts their attempt to delegitimize his election, says ex-British intelligence officer Annie Machon.Annie Machon Consortium NewsThe clash between plutocratic President-elect Trump and the CIA is shaping up to be the heavyweight prize fight of the century, and Trump at least is approaching it with all the entertaining bombast of Mohammed Ali at the top of his game. Rather than following the tradition of doing dirty political deals in dark corners, more commonly known as fixing the match, Trump has come out swinging in the full glare of the media.In that corner, we have a deal-making, billionaire  man of the people  who, to European sensibilities at least, reputedly espouses some of the madder domestic obsessions and yet has seemed to offer hope to many aggrieved Americans. But it is his professed position on building a rapprochement with Russia and cooperating with Moscow to sort out the Syrian mess that caught my attention and that of many other independent commentators internationally.In the opposite corner, Trump s opponents have pushed the CIA into the ring to deliver the knock-out blow, but this has yet to land. Despite jab after jab, Trump keeps evading the blows and comes rattling back against all odds. One has to admire the guy s footwork.So who are the opponents ranged behind the CIA, yelling encouragement through the ropes? The obvious culprits include the U.S. military-industrial complex, whose corporate bottom line relies on an era of unending war. As justification for extracting billions   even trillions   of dollars from American taxpayers, there was a need for frightening villains, such as Al Qaeda and even more so, the head choppers of ISIS. However, since the Russian intervention in Syria in 2015, those villains no longer packed as scary a punch, so a more enduring villain, like Emmanuel Goldstein, the principal enemy of the state in George Orwell s 1984, was required. Russia was the obvious new choice, the old favorite from the Cold War playbook.The Western intelligence agencies have a vested interest in eternal enemies to ensure both eternal funding and eternal power, hence the CIA s entry into the fight. As former British MP and long-time peace activist George Galloway so eloquently said in a recent interview, an unholy alliance is now being formed between the  war party  in the U.S., the military-industrial-intelligence complex and those who would have previously publicly spurned such accomplices: American progressives and their traditional host, the Democratic Party.Yet, if the Democratic National Committee had not done its best to rig the primaries in favor of Hillary Clinton, then perhaps we would not be in this position. Bernie Sanders would be the President-elect.Two-Party ShamThese establishment forces have also revealed to the wider world a fact long known but largely dismissed as conspiracy theory by the corporate mainstream media, that the two-party system in both the U.S. and the U.K. is a sham. In fact, we are governed by a globalized elite, working in its own interest while ignoring ours. The Democrats, openly disgruntled by Hillary Clinton s election loss and being seen to jump into bed so quickly with the spooks and the warmongers, have laid this reality bare.In fact, respected U.S. investigative journalist Robert Parry recently wrote that an intelligence contact told him before the election that the intelligence agencies did not like either of the presidential candidates. This may go some way to explaining the FBI s intervention in the run-up to the election against Hillary Clinton, as well as the CIA s attempts to de-legitimize Trump s victory afterwards.Whether that was indeed the case, the CIA has certainly held back no punches since Trump s election. First the evidence-lite assertion that it was the Russians who hacked the DNC emails and leaked them to WikiLeaks: then the fake news about Russia hacking the voting computers; that then morphed into the Russians  hacked the election  itself; then they  hacked  into the U.S. electric grid via a Vermont utility.  All this without a shred of fact-based evidence provided, but Obama s expulsion of 35 Russian diplomats last month solidified this dubious reality in Americans  minds.All this culminated in the  dirty dossier  allegations last week about Trump, which he has rightly knocked down   it was desperately poor stuff.This last item, from a British perspective, is particularly concerning. It appears that a Washington dirt-digging company was hired by a Republican rival to Trump to unearth any potential Russian scandals during the primaries; once Trump had won the nomination this dirt-digging operation was taken over by a Democrat supporter of Hillary Clinton. The anti-Trump investigation was then sub-contracted to an alleged ex-British spy, an ex-MI6 man named Christopher Steele.The Role of MI6Much has already been written about Steele and the company, much of it contradictory as no doubt befits the life of a former spy. But it is a standard career trajectory for insiders to move on to corporate, mercenary spy companies, and this is what Steele appears to have done successfully in 2009. Of course, much is predicated on maintaining good working relations with your former employers.That is the aspect that interests me most   how close a linkage did he indeed retain with his former employers after he left MI6 in 2009 to set up his own private spy company? The answer is important because companies such has his can also be used as cut-outs for  plausible deniability  by official state spies.I m not suggesting that happened in this case, but Steele reportedly remained on good terms with MI6 and was well thought of. For a man who had not been stationed in Russia for over 20 years, it would perhaps have been natural for him to turn to old chums for useful connections.But this question is of extreme importance at a critical juncture for the U.K.; if indeed MI6 was complicit or even aware of this dirt digging, as it seems to have been, then that is a huge diplomatic problem for the government s attempts to develop a strong working relationship with the US, post-Brexit. If MI6 s sticky fingers were on this case, then the organization has done the precise opposite of its official task    to protect national security and the economic well-being of the UK. MI6 and its U.S. intelligence chums need to remember their designated and legislated roles within a democracy   to serve the government and protect national security by gathering intelligence, assessing it impartially and making recommendations on which the government of the day will choose to act or not as the case may be.The spies are not there to fake intelligence to suit the agenda of a particular regime, as happened in the run-up to the illegal Iraq War, nor are they there to endemically spy on their own populations (and the rest of the world, as we know post-Snowden) in a pointless hunt for subversive activity, which often translates into legitimate political activism and acts of individual expression).And most especially the intelligence agencies should not be trying to subvert democratically elected governments. And yet this is what the CIA and a former senior MI6 officer, along with their powerful political allies, appear to be now attempting against Trump.Chances for PeaceIf I were an American, I would be wary of many of Trump s domestic policies. As a European concerned with greater peace rather than increasing war, I can only applaud his constructive approach towards Russia and his offer to cooperate with Moscow to stanch the bloodshed in the Middle East.That, of course, may be the nub of his fight with the CIA and other vested interests who want Russia as the new bogeyman. But I would bet that Trump takes the CIA s slurs personally. After all, given the ugliness of the accusations and the lack of proof, who would not?So, this is a world championship heavy-weight fight over who gets to hold office and wield power, an area where the U.S. and U.K. intelligence agencies have considerable experience in rigging matches and knocking out opponents. Think, for instance, Iranian Prime Minister Mohammad Mossadeq in 1953; Chilean President Salvador Allende in 1973; Iraqi leader Saddam Hussein in 2003; and Libyan leader Muammar Gaddafi in 2011.

       " 'HARARE (Reuters) - Retired correspondent Cris Chinaka worked for Reuters in Harare from 1990 to 2015. Before that he reported on Zimbabwe for the ZIANA news agency and MOTO, a weekly newspaper. Here he reflects on a third of a century of covering  Uncle Bob . There are two images of Robert Gabriel Mugabe that jump out of my memory to illustrate the contrasting sides of the man who led Zimbabwe for 37 years. The first is of a combative and ebullient 57-year-old, dressed in an olive green military-type suit in the dying days of what was then white-run Rhodesia. Waving a clenched fist in the air, he was scolding his opponents and rallying his supporters as they marched confidently towards the birth of a new nation: Zimbabwe. The second is of a shrunken 93-year-old slumped in a cushioned seat, snoozing. His wife Grace, more than 40 years his junior, whispers in his ear while placing a colorful cowboy hat on his head as thousands of fawning ZANU-PF party faithful applauded. In the nearly four decades that separated those two episodes, Zimbabwe had, in the eyes of its critics, declined into the same state as its leader: hollowed out, impotent and for some an object of ridicule. That first image is from my first meeting with Mugabe, in February 1980, at a ZANU-PF rally in the southeastern province of Masvingo, ahead of the vote that would mark independence from  Britain. As Mugabe was ushered off the stage by his security guards, I introduced myself, shook his hand and asked for an interview. He was warm and attentive at this approach from a junior reporter and said my newspaper, the MOTO weekly, was one of his favorite publications. Aside from its nationalist editorial line, the paper may also have appealed to the Jesuit-educated Mugabe as it was published by the Catholic Church to which he belonged. Shortly after our conversation, Mugabe survived what would be one of many assassination attempts when a land mine exploded,  narrowly missed his vehicle in the motorcade heading back to the capital, Harare. I had a longer one-on-one meeting three years later in March 1983 in India, where I was on a Commonwealth scholarship studying for a postgraduate degree in journalism. Mugabe prided himself on his elephantine and encyclopedic memory, but he must have been briefed on the backgrounds of the students at the Zimbabwean mission function in Delhi. When I introduced myself, he remarked,  Oh, you are our Roman Catholic man, right?  Five years later, when I was covering an official visit to Brussels for Zimbabwe s national news agency, Mugabe s chief of protocol told him:  Your Excellency, that young Roman Catholic man is now a father.  On the return journey, Mugabe came through from the presidential section of the plane into economy class, as he frequently did on such trips, to chat with members of the delegation. This time he sat next to me. He asked about my wife and our new baby daughter. We also discussed my job and current affairs. As he got up to leave after a 30-minute conversation, Mugabe said:  You sound like an intelligent young man. Why did you go into journalism?  Was he just joking, or was this a rare insight into what Mugabe - a man who would later be accused of gagging free speech and individual rights - really thought about the news business?  YOU RE THE ONE WHO SAYS I M DYING?  Mugabe knew the name of my daughter, Tariro, and for many years he would ask after her. I sometimes thought he remembered because she was born around the same time as his own daughter, Bona. On other foreign trips around Africa and Europe, I had opportunities for discussions with Mugabe, invariably about the subject of his mission, but I always got a sense that he was only giving away glimpses of his real thoughts and feelings. Even as his years advanced and his ability to recall distant facts and figures deserted him, he retained a sense of humor - especially at suggestions that he was on his way out. In 2010, having secured an interview for Reuters, I was ushered into his office and greeted him as he sat behind his desk. In return, he remarked with a smile:  Aargh, so you are the man who has been reporting that I am dying?  The interview lasted 90 minutes, and covered everything from his health, the desperate state of the economy and the Western sanctions that his ZANU-PF government blamed for the ills that had befallen the nation. My story focused on his denial that he was suffering from cancer and featured, for the first time, a line that he would repeat many times over the following years.  Jesus died once, and resurrected only once - and poor Mugabe several times,  he said, clapping his hands in glee. ',\n",
       " 'America s next president could be eased into office not just by TV ads or speeches, but by Google s secret decisions, and no one except for me and perhaps a few other obscure researchers would know how this was accomplished.Research I have been directing in recent years suggests that Google, Inc., has amassed far more power to control elections indeed, to control a wide variety of opinions and beliefs than any company in history has ever had. Google s search algorithm can easily shift the voting preferences of undecided voters by 20 percent or more up to 80 percent in some demographic groups with virtually no one knowing they are being manipulated, according to experiments I conducted recently with Ronald E. Robertson.Given that many elections are won by small margins, this gives Google the power, right now, to flip upwards of 25 percent of the national elections worldwide. In the United States, half of our presidential elections have been won by margins under 7.6 percent, and the 2012 election was won by a margin of only 3.9 percent well within Google s control.There are at least three very real scenarios whereby Google perhaps even without its leaders  knowledge could shape or even decide the election next year. Whether or not Google executives see it this way, the employees who constantly adjust the search giant s algorithms are manipulating people every minute of every day. The adjustments they make increasingly influence our thinking including, it turns out, our voting preferences.What we call in our research the Search Engine Manipulation Effect (SEME) turns out to be one of the largest behavioral effects ever discovered. Our comprehensive new study, just published in the Proceedings of the National Academy of Sciences (PNAS), includes the results of five experiments we conducted with more than 4,500 participants in two countries. Because SEME is virtually invisible as a form of social influence, because the effect is so large and because there are currently no specific regulations anywhere in the world that would prevent Google from using and abusing this technique, we believe SEME is a serious threat to the democratic system of government.According to Google Trends, at this writing Donald Trump is currently trouncing all other candidates in search activity in 47 of 50 states. Could this activity push him higher in search rankings, and could higher rankings in turn bring him more support? Most definitely depending, that is, on how Google employees choose to adjust numeric weightings in the search algorithm. Google acknowledges adjusting the algorithm 600 times a year, but the process is secret, so what effect Mr. Trump s success will have on how he shows up in Google searches is presumably out of his hands.***Our new research leaves little doubt about whether Google has the ability to control voters. In laboratory and online experiments conducted in the United States, we were able to boost the proportion of people who favored any candidate by between 37 and 63 percent after just one search session. The impact of viewing biased rankings repeatedly over a period of weeks or months would undoubtedly be larger.In our basic experiment, participants were randomly assigned to one of three groups in which search rankings favored either Candidate A, Candidate B or neither candidate. Participants were given brief descriptions of each candidate and then asked how much they liked and trusted each candidate and whom they would vote for. Then they were allowed up to 15 minutes to conduct online research on the candidates using a Google-like search engine we created called Kadoodle.Each group had access to the same 30 search results all real search results linking to real web pages from a past election. Only the ordering of the results differed in the three groups. People could click freely on any result or shift between any of five different results pages, just as one can on Google s search engine.When our participants were done searching, we asked them those questions again, and, voil : On all measures, opinions shifted in the direction of the candidate who was favored in the rankings. Trust, liking and voting preferences all shifted predictably.More alarmingly, we also demonstrated this shift with real voters during an actual electoral campaign in an experiment conducted with more than 2,000 eligible, undecided voters throughout India during the 2014 Lok Sabha election there the largest democratic election in history, with more than 800 million eligible voters and 480 million votes ultimately cast. Even here, with real voters who were highly familiar with the candidates and who were being bombarded with campaign rhetoric every day, we showed that search rankings could boost the proportion of people favoring any candidate by more than 20 percent more than 60 percent in some demographic groups.Given how powerful this effect is, it s possible that Google decided the winner of the Indian election. Google s own daily data on election-related search activity (subsequently removed from the Internet, but not before my colleagues and I downloaded the pages) showed that Narendra Modi, the ultimate winner, outscored his rivals in search activity by more than 25 percent for sixty-one consecutive days before the final votes were cast. That high volume of search activity could easily have been generated by higher search rankings for Modi.Google s official comment on SEME research is always the same:  Providing relevant answers has been the cornerstone of Google s approach to search from the very beginning. It would undermine the people s trust in our results and company if we were to change course. Could any comment be more meaningless? How does providing  relevant answers  to election-related questions rule out the possibility of favoring one candidate over another in search rankings? Google s statement seems far short of a blanket denial that it ever puts its finger on the scales.There are three credible scenarios under which Google could easily be flipping elections worldwide as you read this:First, there is the Western Union ScenarioGoogle s executives decide which candidate is best for us and for the company, of course and they fiddle with search rankings accordingly. There is precedent in the United States for this kind of backroom king-making. Rutherford B. Hayes, the 19th president of the United States, was put into office in part because of strong support by Western Union. In the late 1800s, Western Union had a monopoly on communications in America, and just before the election of 1876, the company did its best to assure that only positive news stories about Hayes appeared in newspapers nationwide. It also shared all the telegrams sent by his opponent s campaign staff with Hayes s staff. Perhaps the most effective way to wield political influence in today s high-tech world is to donate money to a candidate and then to use technology to make sure he or she wins. The technology guarantees the win, and the donation guarantees allegiance, which Google has certainly tapped in recent years with the Obama administration.Given Google s strong ties to Democrats, there is reason to suspect that if Google or its employees intervene to favor their candidates, it will be to adjust the search algorithm to favor Hillary Clinton. In 2012, Google and its top executives donated more than $800,000 to Obama but only $37,000 to Romney. At least six top tech officials in the Obama administration, including Megan Smith, the country s chief technology officer, are former Google employees. According to a recent report by the Wall Street Journal, since Obama took office, Google representatives have visited the White House ten times as frequently as representatives from comparable companies once a week, on average.Hillary Clinton clearly has Google s support and is well aware of Google s value in elections. In April of this year, she hired a top Google executive, Stephanie Hannon, to serve as her chief technology officer. I don t have any reason to suspect Hannon would use her old connections to aid her candidate, but the fact that she or any other individual with sufficient clout at Google has the power to decide elections threatens to undermine the legitimacy of our electoral system, particularly in close elections.This is, in any case, the most implausible scenario. What company would risk the public outrage and corporate punishment that would follow from being caught manipulating an election? Second, there is the Marius Milner ScenarioA rogue employee at Google who has sufficient password authority or hacking skills makes a few tweaks in the rankings (perhaps after receiving a text message from some old friend who now works on a campaign), and the deed is done. In 2010, when Google got caught sweeping up personal information from unprotected Wi-Fi networks in more than 30 countries using its Street View vehicles, the entire operation was blamed on one Google employee: software engineer Marius Milner. So they fired him, right? Nope. He s still there, and on LinkedIn he currently identifies his profession as  hacker.  If, somehow, you have gotten the impression that at least a few of Google s 37,000 employees are every bit as smart as Milner and possess a certain mischievousness well, you are probably right, which is why the rogue employee scenario isn t as far-fetched as it might seem. And third and this is the scariest possibility there is the Algorithm ScenarioUnder this scenario, all of Google s employees are innocent little lambs, but the software is evil. Google s search algorithm is pushing one candidate to the top of rankings because of what the company coyly dismisses as  organic  search activity by users; it s harmless, you see, because it s all natural. Under this scenario, a computer program is picking our elected officials.To put this another way, our research suggests that no matter how innocent or disinterested Google s employees may be, Google s search algorithm, propelled by user activity, has been determining the outcomes of close elections worldwide for years, with increasing impact every year because of increasing Internet penetration. SEME is powerful precisely because Google is so good at what it does; its search results are generally superb. Having learned that fact over time, we have come to trust those results to a high degree. We have also learned that higher rankings mean better material, which is why 50 percent of our clicks go to the first two items, with more than 90 percent of all clicks going to that precious first search page. Unfortunately, when it comes to elections, that extreme trust we have developed makes us vulnerable to manipulation.In the final days of a campaign, fortunes are spent on media blitzes directed at a handful of counties where swing voters will determine the winners in the all-important swing states. What a waste of resources! The right person at Google could influence those key voters more than any stump speech could; there is no cheaper, more efficient or subtler way to turn swing voters than SEME. SEME also has one eerie advantage over billboards: when people are unaware of a source of influence, they believe they weren t being influenced at all; they believe they made up their own minds.Republicans, take note: A manipulation on Hillary Clinton s behalf would be particularly easy for Google to carry out, because of all the demographic groups we have looked at so far, no group has been more vulnerable to SEME in other words, so blindly trusting of search rankings than moderate Republicans. In a national experiment we conducted in the United States, we were able to shift a whopping 80 percent of moderate Republicans in any direction we chose just by varying search rankings.There are many ways to influence voters more ways than ever these days, thanks to cable television, mobile devices and the Internet. Why be so afraid of Google s search engine? If rankings are so influential, won t all the candidates be using the latest SEO techniques to make sure they rank high?SEO is competitive, as are billboards and TV commercials. No problem there. The problem is that for all practical purposes, there is just one search engine. More than 75 percent of online search in the United States is conducted on Google, and in most other countries that proportion is 90 percent. That means that if Google s CEO, a rogue employee or even just the search algorithm itself favors one candidate, there is no way to counteract that influence. It would be as if Fox News were the only television channel in the country. As Internet penetration grows and more people get their information about candidates online, SEME will become an increasingly powerful form of influence, which means that the programmers and executives who control search engines will also become more powerful.Worse still, our research shows that even when people do notice they are seeing biased search rankings, their voting preferences still shift in the desired directions even more than the preferences of people who are oblivious to the bias. In our national study in the United States, 36 percent of people who were unaware of the rankings bias shifted toward the candidate we chose for them, but 45 percent of those who were aware of the bias also shifted. It s as if the bias was serving as a form of social proof; the search engine clearly prefers one candidate, so that candidate must be the best. (Search results are supposed to be biased, after all; they re supposed to show us what s best, second best, and so on.)Biased rankings are hard for individuals to detect, but what about regulators or election watchdogs? Unfortunately, SEME is easy to hide. The best way to wield this type of influence is to do what Google is becoming better at doing every day: send out customized search results. If search results favoring one candidate were sent only to vulnerable individuals, regulators and watchdogs would be especially hard pressed to find them.For the record, by the way, our experiments meet the gold standards of research in the behavioral sciences: They are randomized (which means people are randomly assigned to different groups), controlled (which means they include groups in which interventions are either present or absent), counterbalanced (which means critical details, such as names, are presented to half the participants in one order and to half in the opposite order) and double-blind (which means that neither the subjects nor anyone who interacts with them has any idea what the hypotheses are or what groups people are assigned to). Our subject pools are diverse, matched as closely as possible to characteristics of a country s electorate. Finally, our recent report in PNAS included four replications; in other words, we showed repeatedly under different conditions and with different groups that SEME is real.Our newest research on SEME, conducted with nearly 4,000 people just before the national elections in the UK this past spring, is looking at ways we might be able to protect people from the manipulation. We found the monster; now we re trying to figure out how to kill it. What we have learned so far is that the only way to protect people from biased search rankings is to break the trust Google has worked so hard to build. When we deliberately mix rankings up, or when we display various kinds of alerts that identify bias, we can suppress SEME to some extent.It s hard to imagine Google ever degrading its product and undermining its credibility in such ways, however. To protect the free and fair election, that might leave only one option, as unpalatable as it might seem: government regulation.Authored by Robert Epstein (@DrREpstein   senior research psychologist at the American Institute for Behavioral Research and Technology), originally posted at Politico.com Via: Zero Hedge',\n",
       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - A close ally of President Xi Jinping is expected to be promoted to vice chairman of China s Central Military Commission, four sources said, as Xi cements his control over the armed forces. Zhang Youxia, 67, one of just a few senior military officers with combat experience, is tipped to become one of at least two vice chairmen of the commission, the sources, including three with direct ties to the leadership, told Reuters. Xi is chairman of the commission, which has overall control of the People s Liberation Army, as well as the nation s president and general secretary of the Communist Party of China. Zhang would replace Fan Changlong, who is expected to retire during the 19th Communist Party Congress which begins on Wednesday. The other vice chairman, Xu Qiliang, is expected to stay on, the sources said. Both Xi and Zhang are from the northwestern province of Shaanxi and both are children of former senior officials who fought together in the civil war in the 1940s. China s Defence Ministry did not respond to a faxed request for comment. The party has been studying a proposal to increase the number of vice chairmen on the military commission from two to four and reduce the number of other committee members, currently eight, some of the sources said. Xi has shaken up the commission and military since assuming power late in 2012 as he roots out corruption and streamlines the 2 million-strong armed forces, the world s largest. Some 300,000 troops have been laid off and advanced new equipment such as stealth fighters has been developed. While China has not fought a war in decades, it is taking an increasingly assertive line in the disputed East China Sea and South China Sea, as well as over self-ruled Taiwan, which is claimed by China. Two outgoing members of the commission are currently under investigation for suspected graft, sources have told Reuters, though the government has yet to confirm this.  It isn t the first time the military has faced corruption issues. A previous vice chairman, Guo Boxiong, was jailed for life for graft last year, while another former vice chairman, Xu Caihou, died of cancer in 2015 before he could face trial over alleged corruption. Zhang is currently the eighth-ranked member of the 11-man military commission. Zhang is also expected to be promoted to the Communist Party s 25-member Politburo, one of its elite ruling bodies, three of the sources said. One source with ties to the leadership said that the fathers of Xi and Zhang - Xi Zhongxun and Zhang Zongxun - had been close.  The two fathers fought together in the civil war that ended in 1949 with the Communist victory and proclamation of the People s Republic of China. Both men rose to senior positions in the government and military.  The second generation of the two families are also close,  the source added, referring to Xi and Zhang. Born in Beijing, Zhang Youxia joined the army in 1968, rising through the ranks and joining the military commission in late 2012.  He fought against Vietnam in a brief border war in 1979 that China launched in punishment for Vietnam invading Cambodia the previous year and ousting the Beijing-backed Khmer Rouge. Zhang was 26 when he was sent to the frontlines to fight the Vietnamese, where he performed well and was quickly promoted, according to state media. He also fought in another border clash with Vietnam in 1984.  During the battle, whether attacking or defending, Zhang Youxia performed excellently,  the official China Youth Daily wrote in August in a piece entitled,  These Chinese generals have killed the enemy on the battlefield . Another officer recently promoted, Li Zuocheng, who was named chief of the Joint Staff Department of the People s Liberation Army in August, also fought in the 1979 war. Li is also likely to become one of the commission s vice chairmen, but it was unclear if he will also join the Politburo, the sources said. One of the sources, who has ties to the military, said Zhang had a reputation when he was based in northeastern China of walking around his base dressed in civilian clothes, prompting challenges from junior soldiers who didn t recognize him.  He doesn t put on airs and likes getting down in the dirt with ordinary soldiers, to know what their lives are like, how they are living and what they are eating,  said the source, speaking on condition of anonymity because of the sensitivity of the matter.

Russian bombers had used unprecedented force in the final stages to finish off the militant group, a senior Russian officer said.   The mission to defeat bandit units of the Islamic State terrorist organization on the territory of Syria, carried out by the armed forces of the Russian Federation, has been accomplished,  Colonel-General Sergei Rudskoi, head of the general staff s operations, said on Rossiya 24 TV channel. Syrian government forces were now combing and de-mining  areas where Islamic State had had their strongholds, he said.  The final stage of the defeat of the terrorists was accompanied by the unprecedented deployment and intense combat use of Russia s air force,  he said. The air strikes included 14 sorties of groups of long-range bombers from Russia made in the past month, he said. Russia s military deployed in Syria would now focus on preserving ceasefires and restoring peaceful life, he said.  ',\n",

In a victory for Native American tribes and conservationists, the designation protects land that is considered sacred and is home to an estimated 100,000 archaeological sites, including ancient cliff dwellings.It s a blow for state Republican leaders and many rural residents who fear it will add another layer of unnecessary federal control and close the area to energy development and recreation, a common refrain in the battle over use of the American West s vast open spaces.In Nevada, a 300,000-acre Gold Butte National Monument outside Las Vegas would protect a scenic and ecologically fragile area near where rancher Cliven Bundy led in an armed standoff with government agents in 2014. It includes rock art, artifacts, rare fossils and recently discovered tracks. Today s actions will help protect this cultural legacy and will ensure that future generations are able to enjoy and appreciate these scenic and historic landscapes,  Obama said in a statement.His administration has rushed to safeguard vulnerable areas ahead of President-elect Donald Trump s inauguration. It has blocked new mining claims outside Yellowstone National Park and new oil drilling in the Arctic Ocean.Obama s creation and expansion of monuments covers more acreage than any other president.But Trump s upcoming presidency has tempered the excitement for tribal leaders and conservationists, with some worrying he could try to reverse or reduce some of Obama s expansive land protections.U.S. Rep. Rob Bishop of Utah, who opposes the Bears Ears Monument, has suggested presidents have the power to undo monuments, though it has not been done before.  FOX NewsBut instead of the picture actually reflecting the land hijacked to make the  national monument  he uses a pic of the wrong area, Arches National Park.As Jason Chaffetz noted, Obama didn t consult him or anyone else in Utah for their approval or their concerns about taking the land.The problem of the Federal government taking private and state land has exploded under Obama, and this is just the latest example.

       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - The new U.S. administration must fully understand the importance of the “one China” policy and appreciate that the issue of Taiwan is highly sensitive for the Beijing government, China said on Monday. U.S. President Donald Trump, who was inaugurated on Friday, said in December the United States did not necessarily have to stick to its long-standing position that Taiwan is part of “one China”. Earlier, Trump broke with decades of precedent by taking a telephone call from Taiwan President Tsai Ing-wen. According to Beijing’s one China principle, Taiwan and mainland China are inalienable parts of a single “China”. Beijing views Taiwan as a wayward province, to be brought under its control by force if necessary.  However, proudly democratic Taiwan shows not interest in being ruled by Beijing. “We urge the new administration to fully understand the high sensitivity of the Taiwan issue and to continue pursuing the one China policy,” Chinese foreign ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying told a regular briefing in Beijing.         Hua called the policy the “political foundation” of future relations between the United States and China. She said any U.S. government had the obligation to stand by the promises made by both main U.S. political parties and “strictly” maintain non-diplomatic relations with Taiwan. Hua also reiterated China’s position on the South China Sea, saying the United States should not meddle in issues of China’s sovereign territory. Both “history and reality” prove good relations between China and the United States were positive for the Asia-Pacific region, she said. China claims most of the energy-rich South China Sea through which about $5 trillion in ship-borne trade passes every year. Neighbours Brunei, Malaysia, Taiwan and Vietnam also have claims. U.S. Secretary of State nominee Rex Tillerson has previously suggested that China would not be allowed access to islands in the region, prompting Chinese state media to say the United States would need to “wage war” to cut off China’s access.

       " 'With a battle heating up between Republicans and Obama on a Supreme Court nomination, the president chooses to skip the funeral of longtime Supreme Court Justice Scalia. This is a classless move by Obama who s got a track record of not showing up at important funerals. He expects the Republicans to be bipartisan, yet he shows his true colors when he does something like this. The White House has confirmed reports that President Barack Obama will not be attending the funeral of late Supreme Court Justice Scalia s funeral which is scheduled for Saturday. Instead, the president and first lady Michelle Obama will pay their respects to Scalia on Friday, when the Justice s body lies in repose in the Great Hall of the Supreme Court building. The White House added that Vice President Joe Biden will attend Saturday s funeral at the Basilica of the National Shrine of the Immaculate Conception.The last supreme court justice to pass away was Justice William Rehnquist in 2005. Then-President George W. Bush not only attended the service, but delivered a eulogy along with Justice Sandra Day O Connor.Critics claim that his decision not to attend Justice Scalia s funeral is just the latest in a string of snubs over the past several years. While Obama has attended some high profile funerals like those of former South African President Nelson Mandela and Senator and ex-KKK member Robert Byrd, the president has skipped out services for a number of high-profile conservatives and members of the U.S. military:Margaret Thatcher When the Iron Lady passed away in 2013, the Obama administration sent what the Daily Signal referred to as  a low-level delegation similar in size and scope to the delegation sent to the funeral of Venezuelan strongman Hugo Chavez. Chris Kyle After Navy SEAL sniper Chris Kyle was murdered on a gun range in 2013, the president opted not to attend his Texas funeral. Furthermore, the president ruffled even more feathers by failing to acknowledge Kyle in his State of the Union address which was held on the same day.Major General Harold Greene Army Major General Harold Greene became the highest ranking combat fatality since Vietnam after he was ambushed by an Afghan police officer in August of 2014. The president was not present when Greene was laid to rest in Arlington National Cemetery. The administration also came under criticism for failing to even releasing a statement upon receiving news of the president s death.Zeinuti Onyango The funeral of President Obama s aunt Zeinuti Onyango was not the high-profile affair of a high ranking government official, but the fact that the decided to play a few rounds of golf instead of attending is somewhat telling. The Kenyan-born Onyango passed away at the age of 61 in 2014.The list could go on and on but here s some great advice from a liberal pundit for Obama:MSNBC host Chris Hayes:  Some amazing advice my mom gave me once:  If you re wondering whether you should go to the funeral, you should go to the funeral.

       " ' I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn t lived that life    Supreme Court Justice SotomayorAs the main stream media does a hit job on Donald Trump for expressing his view that the presiding judge in the Trump University case is biased against him because of Trump s views on immigration, we have a RACIST Latina Supreme Court Justice who s openly declaring that the ethnicity and sex of a judge makes a difference in their judging! So which is it?  The left wants to have it both ways but they re being outed as total hypocrites! Unreal! Judge Sotomayor questioned whether achieving impartiality  is possible in all, or even, in most, cases.  She added,  And I wonder whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society. AND THEY RE CALLING TRUMP A RACIST?WASHINGTON   In 2001, Sonia Sotomayor, an appeals court judge, gave a speech declaring that the ethnicity and sex of a judge  may and will make a difference in our judging. In her speech, Judge Sotomayor questioned the famous notion   often invoked by Justice Ruth Bader Ginsburg and her retired Supreme Court colleague, Sandra Day O Connor   that a wise old man and a wise old woman would reach the same conclusion when deciding cases. I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn t lived that life,  said Judge Sotomayor, who is now considered to be near the top of President Obama s list of potential Supreme Court nominees.Her remarks, at the annual Judge Mario G. Olmos Law and Cultural Diversity Lecture at the University of California, Berkeley, were not the only instance in which she has publicly described her view of judging in terms that could provoke sharp questioning in a confirmation hearing.This month, for example, a video surfaced of Judge Sotomayor asserting in 2005 that a  court of appeals is where policy is made.  She then immediately adds:  And I know   I know this is on tape, and I should never say that because we don t make law. I know. O.K. I know. I m not promoting it. I m not advocating it. I m   you know. The video was of a panel discussion for law students interested in becoming clerks, and she was explaining the different experiences gained when working at district courts and appeals courts. Her remarks caught the eye of conservative bloggers who accused her of being a  judicial activist,  although Jonathan H. Adler, a professor at Case Western Reserve University law school, argued that critics were reading far too much into those remarks.Republicans have signaled that they intend to put the eventual nominee under a microscope, and they say they were put on guard by Mr. Obama s statement that judges should have  empathy,  a word they suggest could be code for injecting liberal ideology into the law.Judge Sotomayor has given several speeches about the importance of diversity. But her 2001 remarks at Berkeley, which were published by the Berkeley La Raza Law Journal, went further, asserting that judges  identities will affect legal outcomes. Whether born from experience or inherent physiological or cultural differences,  she said, for jurists who are women and nonwhite,  our gender and national origins may and will make a difference in our judging. Her remarks came in the context of reflecting her own life experiences as a Hispanic female judge and on how the increasing diversity on the federal bench  will have an effect on the development of the law and on judging. In making her argument, Judge Sotomayor sounded many cautionary notes. She said there was no uniform perspective that all women or members of a minority group have, and emphasized that she was not talking about any individual case.She also noted that the Supreme Court was uniformly white and male when it delivered historic rulings against racial and sexual discrimination. And she said she tried to question her own  opinions, sympathies and prejudices,  and aspired to impartiality.Still, Judge Sotomayor questioned whether achieving impartiality  is possible in all, or even, in most, cases.  She added,  And I wonder whether by ignoring our differences as women or men of color we do a disservice both to the law and society. Read more: NYT ',\n",
       " 'Are there any coincidences in the quid pro quo world of Obama s Chicago style politics?  Here s the link story we posted about Chobani and their naked lesbian ad. The video of their ad can be seen below:New York yogurt manufacturer Chobani just landed a massive U.S. Department of Agriculture contract for school lunches after years of lobbying lawmakers and President Obama on its products.The upstate-New York Greek yogurt maker will be distributing its products to schools nationwide next year as a USDA-approved meat substitute for school lunches, capping off a pilot program in a dozen states made possible by extensive lobbying efforts.Chobani Greek Yogurt first gained approval by the USDA for school lunches in 2013 as part of a pilot program after U.S. Sen. Charles Schumer and other New York lawmakers pressured USDA officials to include it in a pilot program for four states. The USDA s typically years-long approval process for new products was miraculously slashed to only about 8 months for Chobani.That pilot program was expanded last year to a dozen states after reportedly positive feedback from students, Syracuse.com reports. After at least three calls from the persistent senator, (U.S. Secretary of Agriculture Tom) Vilsack helped arranged a Sept. 20, 2012 meeting in Schumer s Capitol Hill office with Kevin Concannon, the key official for food, nutrition and consumer services,  the New York Daily News reports.Chobani owner Hamdi Ulukaya was also named by President Obama as a  Presidential Ambassador for Global Entrepreneurship,  which included a  closed-press  meeting with the president at the White House, according to the Daily Sabah.The special treatment was undoubtedly the result of Ulukaya s savvy political sense.According to a Green Monsters! blog about the original pilot program:  Chobani has made a significant financial investment to be at the forefront of this new program and potentially come out as the victor. The New York-based company has already paid $80,000 to Cornerstone Government Affairs to lobby Congress on its behalf. Among its lobbyists are former agricultural department employees.The lobbying firm was also hired following New York Senator Charles Schumer s petition to the USDA asking that Greek yogurt be added school lunch program.The decision on Greek yogurt came rather quickly in just eight months although the agriculture department typically takes years to assess a new product.  The tofu industry waited a decade before an ok,  reports NY Daily News.Senator Schumer also worked with Senator Kirsten Gillibrand of New York to push the Greek yogurt pilot program through. Both senators see it as a win-win for the children and the diary industry.The financial benefit has the potential to be quite considerable for New York in particular. Five years ago, the New York dairy industry was producing barely any revenue. Now it generates almost 40 percent of the $6.5 billion in U.S. yogurt sales annually. Businessweek magazine has even called upstate New York  the Silicon Valley of yogurt. So, after a couple of years of lobbying and a pilot test program, Chobani   the top selling Greek yogurt brand in the U.S.   landed a contract for schools in all 50 states in April. The initial contract is worth $148,019 for the first two months of the 2015-16 school year, Syracuse.com reports.The government will then seek quarterly bids for the remainder of the school year.Chobani s fast-track to school cafeterias across the U.S.   with a contract awarded faster than other companies have even gained approval for their products   raises the same question Green Mosters! blogger Kristina Pepelko first raised in 2013: is the National School Lunch Program and the tightened restrictions on school food truly designed to produce healthier students, or are special interest lobbyists driving menu recommendations from Washington, D.C.?Chobani s senior director of nutrition and regulatory affairs, Robert Post, obviously wants the public to believe it s the former. This is an important step that Chobani is taking in its continued mission to bring nutritious, delicious and natural food to all people of all ages,  he said in a statement. Allowing children to have healthy and delicious options for their lunch tray ingredients is one of the most important things Chobani can do as a company, and we decided to offer out products at significantly reduced prices as we want to extend our mission beyond our cups and into the communities we live in,  Post said.Chobani officials have not disclosed the  significantly reduced prices  for their products, or the potential value of the new government contract, Syracuse.com reports.Via: EAG News',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Secret Service is investigating an incident at presidential candidate Donald Trump’s rally in Radford, Virginia in which an agent shoved a Time magazine photographer to the ground, an agency spokesman said on Tuesday. “We are investigating the matter fully to find out what our employee did and what the other person did,” Kevin Dye told Reuters.  Video footage of the altercation on Monday, which was posted on the Internet, shows Time magazine photographer Christopher Morris getting close to the agent, who threw him to the ground and Morris kicking the agent from the floor. The magazine said Morris was knocked to the ground after stepping out of the press hold to take a picture of protesters. A Trump campaign spokeswoman acknowledged the incident, but said the campaign was not aware of the details. In a statement published in Time, Morris said he had covered the White House for nine years without altercations with the Secret Service. “The rules at Trump events are significantly stricter than other campaigns and make it very difficult to work as a photographer, as many others have pointed out before me,” Morris said. “I regret my role in the confrontation, but the agent’s response was disproportionate and unnecessarily violent.” Free speech advocates have decried Trump’s treatment of protesters and reporters at his rallies, including ushering out dissenters and shouting at the press.   The Secret Service said it would never intervene to quiet protesters or restrict journalists unless there was a public safety matter.  “The Secret Service’s role is to protect the candidate and the public,” Dye said. “(Agents are) not in any way responsible for removing protesters. We have a strong commitment to upholding the First Amendment.” Trump and Ben Carson are the only two Republican presidential contenders to receive Secret Service protection, along with Democratic contenders Hillary Clinton and Bernie Sanders. Candidates must request the coverage.  White House spokesman Josh Earnest on Tuesday acknowledged that the Secret Service has indicated it would “look at this particular situation.” ',\n",

       " 'The Supreme Court did something amazing on Monday. They decided, with a unanimous conscience, that the principle of  one person one vote  was the way to go in a Democratic Republic like the United States.Still reeling from the disastrous decision that struck down the Voting Rights Act in 2013, Republicans sought to double down on their assaults on voting rights through racist gerrymandering.Today, the Supreme Court gave Republicans a well-deserved  F-You  when they rejected the GOP s appeal to a lower Virginia court ruling that overturned the redistricted map.Sending the case back to the lower court, the Supreme Court basically said they got it right, and see no reason to consider an appeal, thus giving Democrats (and the people of Virginia) the fairness they deserved and were robbed of in 2012.Two years ago, a federal court struck down Virginia s newly drawn congressional maps because the drawers packed tens of thousands of black voters into an already heavily black, heavily Democratic congressional district. The redrawing, which heavily favored Republicans, allowed the GOP to win 8 out of the state s 11 congressional districts, even though President Obama won the state by three points and the electorate was down ticket.While it won t capture a majority of the 8 seats held by Republicans, the decision will certainly be turning the 4th Congressional District blue. Currently represented by Randy Forbes, the district will go from having a 48 percent Democratic electorate to a rightful 60 percent.With Democrats aiming to take back the House and keep the swing state of Virginia blue in November, this decision has come at a very good time.Looks like another gerrymandering, redistricting ploy from the Republicans to steal the elections has gone down in flames. Last year, the Supreme Court smacked down Republicans in Arizona when they tried to pull the same shenanigans. With Arizona s booming Hispanic and Latino populations, GOP control is on the verge of collapsing.Republicans want to hold onto absolute power, and they are seeing it slip away from them. So they try to cheat to win. And sometimes the Supreme Court does he right thing and blocks them from doing just that.Since it wasn t picked up, that means at least 5 Justices (out of eight) or more said no. If Scalia was still alive, I wonder if the case would have been picked up. And had it been picked up, how would the Court have decided it?Maybe Republicans shouldn t be so quick to turn down a moderate Merrick Garland confirmation. Not that he outcome would have been any different in their favor.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'HOUSTON (Reuters) - Buckeye Partners LP s Yabucoa oil terminal in Puerto Rico remained closed on Friday, the company said, days after Hurricane Maria left a trail of destruction and at least 25 people dead across the Caribbean. The U.S. oil storage and transportation company did not say if the tanks at the 4.6-million-barrel terminal were damaged by the storm, which made landfall near Yabucoa, but it said a full assessment of the facility is under way.  We are working to maintain the safety and well-being of our Yabucoa, Puerto Rico employees,  it said in a statement. A larger terminal operated by U.S. NuStar Energy LP on the island of St. Eustatius, with capacity to store up to 13.03 million barrels of oil, also has been unable to reopen after a previous hurricane, Irma, affected several tanks. The closure of oil terminals in the Caribbean and restrictions to load and discharge large vessels in several Texas ports have constrained flows of crude and refined products across the Atlantic in recent weeks. Maria, the second major hurricane to hit the Caribbean this month, lashed the Turks and Caicos Islands on Friday after knocking out power to all of Puerto Rico and pushing several rivers to record flood levels.

       " 'VIENNA (Reuters) - The head of the U.N. nuclear watchdog said on Monday Iran was abiding by the rules set out in a nuclear accord it signed with six world powers in 2015, after Washington suggested it was not adhering to the deal. The State Department must notify Congress every 90 days of Iran s compliance with the deal. The next deadline is October and U.S. President Donald Trump has said he thinks by then the United States will declare Iran non-compliant. Yukiya Amano, the head of the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), said Iran had not broken any promises and was not receiving special treatment.  The nuclear-related commitments undertaken by Iran under the (deal) are being implemented,  he said in the text of a speech to a quarterly meeting of the IAEA s 35-member Board of Governors.  Most sanctions on Iran were lifted 18 months ago under the deal and, despite overstepping a limit on its stocks of one chemical, it has adhered to the key limitations imposed on it. In April, Trump ordered a review of whether a suspension of sanctions on Iran related to the nuclear deal, negotiated under President Barack Obama, was in the U.S. national security interest. He has called it  the worst deal ever negotiated.  The U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, traveled to Vienna last month to speak with Amano about Iran and asked if the IAEA planned to inspect Iranian military sites, something she has called for. Iran dismissed the U.S. demand as  merely a dream . Amano declined to comment on Haley s statements when asked by reporters. Iran has been applying an Additional Protocol, which is in force in dozens of nations and gives the IAEA access to sites, including military locations, to clarify questions or inconsistencies that may arise.  We will continue to implement the Additional Protocol in Iran ... as we do in other countries,  Amano said, referring to so-called complementary access visits granted under the protocol, details of which Amano said were confidential.  I cannot tell you how many complementary accesses we have had, but I can tell you ... that we have had access to locations more frequently than many other countries with extensive nuclear programs.  He called verification measures in Iran  the most robust regime  currently in existence. In addition, the IAEA can request access to Iranian sites including military ones if it has concerns about activities or materials there that would violate the agreement, but it must show Iran the basis for those concerns. That means new and credible information pointing to such a violation is required first, officials from the agency and major powers say. There is no indication that Washington has presented such information. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. House of Representatives on Thursday passed a $1.2 trillion bill to fund most government activities in the fiscal year beginning Oct. 1, knowing the Senate will disagree with many controversial elements and force a negotiation that could stretch into December. The bill, passed by a 211-198 vote largely along party lines in the Republican-controlled House, provides $658.1 billion for the Department of Defense and $44.3 billion for the Department of Homeland Security, including roughly $1.6 billion for construction of physical barriers along the U.S.-Mexican border. The $31.4 billion allotted for the Department of the Interior, the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA), the Forest Service, the Indian Health Service and related agencies cut the EPA’s funding by $534 million when compared to the prior fiscal year. The funding measure also included a provision that would stop the Internal Revenue Service from implementing a provision of the 2010 Affordable Care Act, commonly known as Obamacare, that imposes a tax penalty on individuals who elect to go without health insurance. Representative Kevin McCarthy, a member of Republican leadership, said the funding measure would make “major changes to the way Washington spends taxpayer dollars.” “Our funding legislation forces the government to do what it ought to do and to stop doing what it shouldn’t do,” McCarthy said in a statement, praising it for “strengthening our national defense, veterans’ programs, and border security,” and “cutting abusive Washington agencies like the IRS and the EPA.” Democrats warned that the bill, which bundled together 12 separate funding measures and earned just one Democratic vote, would need substantial revision in the Senate, where Republicans hold 52 of 100 seats but most legislation requires 60 votes for passage. “These bills cannot be enacted into law because they cannot gain Democratic votes,” Democratic Representative Nita Lowey said in a statement, calling the House-passed bill “inadequate and partisan.”   ',\n",

       " 'GAZA (Reuters) - Rival Palestinian factions Fatah and Hamas agreed on Wednesday to delay final transfer of power of the Gaza Strip from Hamas to the Western-backed Palestinian government by 10 days to Dec. 10 to allow time to  complete arrangements , officials said. The factions signed a reconciliation deal brokered by Egypt last month after Hamas agreed to hand over administrative control of Gaza, including the key Rafah border crossing, a decade after seizing the enclave in a civil war. The deal bridges a bitter gulf between the Western-backed mainstream Fatah party of Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas and Hamas, an Islamist movement designated as a terrorist group by Western countries and Israel. The agreement states that Hamas, which has disbanded its administration, would complete the handover by December 1 but disputes over the transfer process have emerged in recent days and Cairo has sent a senior security delegation to the territory to try to resolve the deadlock. In a brief joint statement, Fatah and Hamas said they had asked Egypt to delay the timetable from Dec 1 so that they could   complete the arrangements to successfully conclude reconciliation steps to which the Palestinian people aspire . Completion will also strengthen Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas s standing at any potential resumption of the stalled peacemaking process with Israel, analysts say. It was initially unclear whether the deadline extension would prevent the 40,000-50,000 Hamas-hired employees being paid their November salaries on time.  Hamas has demanded that Abbas lift sanctions he has imposed on Gaza such as slashing salaries of Palestinian Authority-hired public servants and limiting electricity imported from Israel for Gaza.  The Palestinian Authority has demanded that it must have full control of Gaza in order to be able to discharge its administrative powers there and failure to pay the salaries could endanger further reconciliation steps. Earlier on Wednesday, tension between the two factions rose when Hamas refused to allow Palestinian Authority employees to return to their jobs at three ministries as instructed by the government.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department on Saturday moved to begin admitting refugees, including Syrians, as soon as Monday after a federal judge on Friday blocked a Trump administration temporary ban on refugee admissions.An email from the State Department’s refugee office reviewed by Reuters Saturday said the U.S. government is working with its legal team and interagency and overseas partners to comply with the ruling. Trump’s Jan. 27 executive order had suspended refugee admissions for 120 days and indefinitely barred Syrian refugees but U.S. Judge James Robart in Seattle on Friday blocked the president’s order. A U.S. State Department official told Reuters on Saturday that officials “expect some refugees to arrive Monday.” The U.S. instructed the International Organization for Migration “to rebook refugees of all nationalities, including Syrians, who were” to schedule to arrive since the Trump’s order was signed, the email said. “We are focusing on booking refugee travel through February 17. We are asking that arrivals resume this Monday, the first normal travel day of the week, if possible.  We are aware that some refugees may not be ready to depart on short notice,” the email said. A United Nations spokesman, Leonard Doyle, told the New York Times about 2,000 refugees were ready to travel. Refugees do not usually enter on weekends, a U.S. official said, as the department hews to a strict set of rules on how their admissions are processed.  Other travelers from seven Muslim majority countries affected by President Donald Trump’s week-old curb on immigration can rework their flights after the judge’s order, as long as they have valid visas.  Refugees fleeing war, hunger and persecution have less autonomy. Advocates working on their behalf urged the government to move quickly on admitting them.       International Refugee Assistance Project Director Becca Heller called for “the instant resumption of the U.S. Refugee Admissions Program to immediately take the most vulnerable refugees out of harm’s way.” During the week of the ban, the government admitted 843 refugees - but no Syrian refugees, government figures show. Officials previously told Reuters that they were “in transit” and had already been cleared for resettlement before the ban took effect. For refugee families, they are trying to keep expectations in check and hope they do not end up back where they started.  Ayham Oubeid, a Syrian living in Cleveland, has been waiting for over a year for his brother George’s family to come to the United States as refugees. His brother, who has health issues, is living in Dubai on a work visa that covers him, his six-year-old daughter and five-months pregnant wife. George left his job and moved the family out of their apartment when he was told they would be resettled in the United States on Feb. 13. But the family’s plane tickets were canceled when Trump announced the temporary ban. Without George’s job, the family could lose the work visa and be sent back to Syria in the midst of its deadly civil war. Upon hearing of the judge’s ruling from Friday, Oubeid called George. He was careful not to be too hopeful, knowing the judge’s order could be overturned. “I don’t want to get excited. I don’t want my brother to get excited. Because it was hard for him when he lost everything and was told he couldn’t come,” Oubeid said. ',\n",

He turned himself in to police a month later, according to the police report obtained by Radar. He was charged with a felony and two misdemeanors and pleaded no contest in April 2016, in exchange for his probationThis thug was let off easy after committing that crime since he was given summary probation in lieu of jail time, after pleading no contest to one felony and two misdemeanors he was charged with. However, on August 4, 2016, right after partying with the president s daughter, he was found to be in  violation of supervision  and ordered back to court for probation violation, Radar reported.Bennett is the younger brother of Chance the Rapper and son of a politically connected dad who worked for both President Barack Obama and Mayor Rahm Emanuel.Chancelor Bennett (better known as  Chance The Rapper ) is seen above in the center of the photo with his brother, Taylor, and their father Ken.

       " 'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - Temporary border controls inside the European Union s free-travel zone could be extended for up to three years during a crisis, the European Commission proposed on Wednesday, giving it more leeway to stem migration. The proposal by the EU executive comes as border controls in Germany, Austria, Denmark, and Norway expire, part of the European Union s response to a surge of refugees and migrants in November 2015 that tested EU rules on passport-free travel. Those countries must lift the frontier checks by November this year under a two-year-limit set by the bloc in the so-called Schengen area, which is named after a town in Luxembourg and aims to be a symbol of free movement in the bloc.  While not referring to the four countries, the Commission s plan, if agreed by EU governments, would allow them to keep the controls in place for another year if they can justify them. EU home affairs commissioner Dimitris Avramopoulos said the threat of migrants coming through Greece and the Western Balkans was no longer a valid excuse for frontier checks.  No internal border control ... in relation to those from the eastern Mediterranean will be possible after November,  Avramopoulos told a news conference.  All member states maintain the possibility to introduce internal border controls for other threats to their internal security,  he said, stressing those  must remain exceptional.  Germany has long argued it needs the controls to combat the threat of Islamic militancy in Europe. The EU has taken in more than 1.7 million people from the Middle East and Africa since 2014. But after a mass influx in 2015, numbers have gone down steadily following a 2016 deal that closed the route from Turkey to Greece. The EU has also stepped up support for Libya to curb arrivals in Italy. Sweden has lifted its border checks but has stepped up internal controls. Norway is part of Schengen but not the EU. ',\n",
       " 'Legendary newsman Dan Rather has lived through and covered several presidencies so he knows what he s talking about.Rather was just a boy of 13 when Franklin D. Roosevelt died in 1945. In 1950, he began his career in journalism while Harry Truman was in office.Since then, Rather has witnessed every presidential beginning and has even reported on them.And according to Rather, Donald Trump s first two months in the presidency are the worst he has ever seen.Rather posted his observation on Facebook early Monday morning, even going so far as to quip that the only president who had a worse start was William Henry Harrison, who died one month after being sworn in.We re roughly two months into the Trump Presidency, and it is the worst start to a time in office I have ever seen. I am not alone in this conclusion. Many Presidential scholars are saying it s the worst start of any Presidency in the history of the country.Now William Henry Harrison in 1841 talked too long in the cold of his inauguration. He caught pneumonia and died a month later. So, yes, I suppose you could say that his time was worse.One of those Presidential scholars is Douglas Brinkley, who said that that Trump s administration is so bad that treason is hanging over it. This is the most failed first 100 days of any president,  Brinkley concluded.Rather then briefly listed some of Trump s failures.So after two tumultuous, chaotic and in many ways outrageous months (an embarrassing defeat on ACA repeal, the deepening Russia probe, the striking down of the travel ban) where do we stand? Where does all of this go?Rather went on to warn the American people that  a weak President running a weak, ragtag administration is a prescription for trouble. Trouble internationally could come from enemies and other competitors who may see opportunities for advantage and overreach. Trouble internally could easily come from a worried, divided nation, and opportunistic ideologues and politicians who try to exploit the situation.Rather concluded by urging people to remain vigilant and continue fighting.Donald Trump and his entire administration is a bad joke. He has turned our nation into a laughingstock around the world and has repeatedly demonstrated that he is incompetent.Trump should resign before he embarrasses our country and himself even further.Featured Image: Matthew Eisman/Getty Images',\n",

It didn t take long before he and Republican congressional candidate Dan Bongino got into a vicious fight over Bongino s blatant ignorance.Insisting that Trump s comments were not actually implying violence, Bongino brushed the matter off and showed a horrifying amount of disrespect when he claimed he was  trying not to break down in laughter  over Lemon s concern about Trump s remarks. Lemon fought back and said Trump needed to be more accountable and responsible with his words, and Bongino countered,  You didn t come into this with a clear and open mind! That s when Lemon lost it. Reacting to an unfathomable lack of logic, Lemon responded the way everyone should. The furious host went off: What you re saying right now makes no sense! I m sitting at home, I m watching Donald Trump. I have two ears and I have two eyes and I can see the reactions  We re not stupid!  You should be ashamed of yourself! Bongino yelled back at Lemon for talking to me as if I m a child!  and as Lemon criticized him for  lying , Bongino s temper tantrum got so bad that he yelled for the network to cut off his mic: You don t know crap about this, Don! You re a TV guy! I was a Secret Service Agent! Now cut off my mic! Do what you wanna do! Bongino s request was ignored, and Lemon (with the rest of the guests) spent the remaining segment trying to make Bongino understand why Trump s comments were so unsettling. The two men spent the show basically at each other s throats. Bongino continued to deny the fact that the Secret Service is actually taking this matter very seriously despite the evidence Lemon kept pointing out, and the CNN host became increasingly frustrated with Bongino s stupidity.You can watch Lemon unload on Bongino below:Featured image is a screenshot',\n",

       " 'It s no secret that Donald Trump s second-in-command, Mike Pence, is a bigot. He first rose to national prominence amid a sea of scandal over a sweeping law that he signed as governor of Indiana that was clearly designed to discriminate against LGBTQ people. In fact, the law was so terrible that the state s largest newspaper, the Indianapolis Star, devoted an entire front page to a message to Pence:  FIX THIS NOW. After that, Pence s approval ratings plummeted, and it became clear that there was no way he could get re-elected, even after soliciting the help of the Koch Brothers, and therefore became Trump s running mate instead.Now, since Pence s bigotry is so well known, he is generally not well received at events where people have objections to overt discrimination against marginalized groups of people. To that end, it should come as no surprise that the graduates at Notre Dame walked out when Pence spoke at their commencement. Of course, Pence s fellow bigoted Republican senator, Tom Cotton, is fuming that the students had the gall to stand up for what they believe in. Cotton told NBC News via a statement: It is especially unfortunate that students walked out of the vice president s speech on Sunday   because if any young people needed to hear how important freedom of speech is to our country, it would be them. I think the vice president deserves credit for speaking out on the spread of intolerance at college campuses   and I know he deserved better treatment than what he received this weekend. No, Senator Cotton, Pence deserved exactly what he got, and then some. It s really pretty simple: If Pence wants people to stop treating him like a bigot, he needs to stop acting like one. This is a man who regularly and openly expresses hatred against any group of Americans who aren t just like him   and makes the laws to match. Tell me, sir, if this were an overt racist or anti-Semite speaking at commencement, would you be defending that person as well?Didn t think so. Bigotry is bigotry, and Mike Pence exudes it in spades. Hopefully, he is humiliated like this everywhere he goes until he simply refuses to appear in public again.Featured image by Chip Somodevilla via Getty Images',\n",
       " 'HONG KONG (Reuters) - Macau has suspended a pro-democracy lawmaker for alleged  disobedience  after he took to the street instead of staying on a sidewalk during a protest, as activists warn suppression of civil rights is growing in the China-ruled gambling hub. The suspension of the lawmaker is the first since 1999, when the former Portuguese colony returned to China within a  one country, two systems  framework that allows a free press and an independent judiciary, liberties denied on the mainland.  It s a dark day for Macau,  said Jose Coutinho, one of four legislators who voted against the suspension in Monday s secret ballot, which drew 28 votes in favor.  I am sad and disillusioned with this outcome.   There were numerous illegalities in the ballot and the lawmaker, 26-year-old Sulu Sou, should have been given an opportunity to defend himself, Coutinho added. Sou is awaiting trial over a protest in 2016 against a perceived conflict of interest in the transfer of 100 million yuan ($15 million) from the charitable government-linked Macau Foundation to a Chinese university on whose board its chief executive, Fernando Chui, sits.   No date has been set for Sou s trial, but the assembly vote strips him of his duties, and he can only return if he is found not guilty or gets a jail term shorter than 30 days.   Many in Macau fear the decision signals authorities intend  to follow a path similar to that of former British colony Hong Kong, which has jailed several pro-democracy activists, including a lawmaker, Nathan Law, in the past year.  This may be the beginning of the death sentence to Macau s rule of law, and it will end up having an impact in the casino industry,  said Jorge Menezes, a lawyer who has lived in Macau since 1997.  Sou was stripped of his rights to participate in the debate and vote in a clear violation of the assembly s rules,  said Menezes, adding that such violations could apply elsewhere in Macau, including the casino industry. Macau is the world s biggest gambling hub, home to U.S. companies Las Vegas Sands, Wynn Resorts and MGM Resorts as well as Melco Resorts, Galaxy Entertainment and SJM Holdings.  The casinos have all reaped billions of dollars in the only place where Chinese citizens are allowed to gamble but will be at the mercy of authorities when their licenses start to expire in 2020. Sou, who has challenged the government on several issues since becoming a lawmaker in September, vowed to fight on.  We stick together for the very same goal that put us on this course to fight for justice,  grassroots supporter the New Macau Association, which has stood by him, said on social media site Facebook.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress on Wednesday passed and sent to President Barack Obama legislation strengthening legal protection for companies’ trade secrets, including manufacturing processes and computer methods. The House of Representatives voted 410-2 to approve the “Defend Trade Secrets Act” on the heels of it being unanimously passed by the Senate earlier this month. The legislation, which is backed by the White House, would open the door for companies to sue in federal court for damages related to theft of trade secrets. House Judiciary Committee Chairman Bob Goodlatte said the measure “will help American innovators protect their intellectual property from criminal theft by foreign agents and those engaging in economic espionage.” In urging its passage, Goodlatte rattled off iconic U.S. products including fried chicken from the fast food restaurant KFC and Coca Cola, saying the legislation would provide further protections for their secret recipes.  Theft of intellectual property, including trade secrets, is estimated to cost American firms more than $300 billion a year, according to a 2013 report by the Commission on the Theft of American Intellectual Property. Trade secret theft already is a federal crime, but without the right to sue in federal court, companies must seek redress in state courts amid a patchwork of state laws. Corporations such as Boeing Co and Johnson & Johnson, as well as the U.S. Chamber of Commerce and computer software lobbyists representing companies such as Apple Inc and Microsoft Corp, have pushed for the enhanced protections. Backers of the legislation have cited a case last year in which a South Korean company, Kolon Industries, was found guilty in U.S. federal court of conspiracy to steal trade secrets from DuPont. The foreign firm was ordered to pay $85 million in criminal fines and $275 million in restitution for illegally obtaining information on the chemical company’s Kevlar body armor, which resulted in nearly $1 billion in economic losses for DuPont, according to lawmakers. In allowing civil suits in federal court for illegal procurement of trade secrets including manufacturing processes, formulas, computer algorithms, industrial designs, business strategies and customer lists, the legislation aims to create uniform standards for what constitutes trade secret theft. “In today’s digital environment, it has never been easier to transfer trade secrets across the globe with the click of a cell phone, tablet, or computer key,” said Representative Jerrold Nadler, the leading Democratic co-sponsor of the legislation.

If confirmed, it would be the fourth such U.S. strike inside Pakistan since President Donald Trump took office in January.  Two Pakistani intelligence officials and a local government officer said an unmanned aerial vehicle dropped two missiles on a compound housing  militants under the command of a senior network commander, Abdur Rasheed Haqqani.  Villagers initially reported a blast in the Upper Kurram area to authorities, said one of the officials, adding,  We got it from our informant later that it was a U.S. drone strike that targeted Haqqanis.    It was not clear if the commander was among those killed, added the officials, who sought anonymity as the issue is a sensitive one. Trump s new strategy for the Afghanistan war calls for a tougher stance with Pakistan against militants such as the Haqqani network who have bases inside Pakistan. Since the Afghan policy review, the U.S. has been pushing Islamabad for decisive action against the Haqqani network militants, who are notorious for using Pakistani soil to launch attacks against American-led NATO troops in Afghanistan. Islamabad denies the allegations, and, instead, blames Kabul for not taking out militants who use Afghan territory as a base for attacks on targets in Pakistan.  Pakistan has been facing a deadly Islamist militancy for more than a decade. Gunmen attacked a minority Shi ite Muslim mosque in Islamabad, the capital, on Wednesday, killing two people.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump decided to fire FBI chief James Comey before Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein wrote a memo outlining his own concerns, Rosenstein said in a statement on Friday that lent credence to Trump’s version of events. When it was announced this month that Comey had been fired, White House officials initially pointed to the Rosenstein memo as a reason for firing the FBI director, who was overseeing an investigation into any collusion between Russia and the Trump campaign during the 2016 U.S. presidential election. Trump said in a subsequent interview with NBC News that he had been planning to fire Comey before he received the Rosenstein memo. In a statement on Friday seen by Reuters, Rosenstein writes: “I informed the senior attorney that the president was going to remove Director Comey, (and) that I was writing a memorandum to the attorney general summarizing my own concerns.”  The statement, first reported by NBC News, Rosenstein goes on to outline some of his concerns with Comey’s job performance. But toward the end of the 2 1/2-page document, Rosenstein writes: “My memorandum is not a statement of reasons to justify a for-cause termination (firing).” After Rosenstein briefed members of the House of Representatives on Friday, Congressman Darrell Issa was asked by reporters if Rosenstein indicated whether anyone had asked or encouraged him to write the memo about Comey. “I don’t believe he ... indicated anyone directed him but in fact he wrote the memo,” said Issa, who, like Trump, is a Republican. Some Democrats left the briefing saying they were not satisfied with the information Rosenstein provided. “There was a presentation followed by Q and A and not a whole lot of A,” said Democratic Representative Charles Crist. Representative Brad Sherman, also a Democrat, said Rosenstein “avoided at least 10 times” Democrats’ queries into whether the Justice Department official was pressured to write a memo critical of Comey. Sherman, a member of the House Foreign Affairs Committee, told reporters that while Washington investigations are exploring whether there was collusion between Trump campaign officials and the Kremlin and a possible cover-up, “neither of them have been proven.” ',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump has been bragging nonstop about the Carrier deal that supposedly kept more than 1,000 jobs in the U.S., but workers at the company are calling him out for being full of it. On Tuesday, the Carrier union s president said point blank that Trump  lied his ass off  when it came to the terms of the deal.United Steelworkers 1999 President Chuck Jones said that when Trump first said that he was going to save those 1,350 at the Indiana plant, he was hopeful. As The Hill explains,  Carrier had originally planned to move the jobs to Mexico, but decided to keep 730 of the jobs in Indiana after receiving $7 million in tax breaks from the state, where Vice President-elect Mike Pence is governor. Jones, giving the billionaire con-man far more credit than he deserves, fully expected that when Trump got up in front of the cameras on Dec. 1, he would explain that 550 of those jobs weren t saved at all. But he got up there,  Jones said,  and, for whatever reason, lied his ass off. Last week, Trump couldn t stop boasting about the deal during his ridiculous celebratory rally. Now they re keeping   actually the number s over 1,100 people,  he said,  which is so great. But Jones says this is utter bullsh*t. Trump and Pence, he explains, were more than a little misleading and some of the jobs they claimed to have saved weren t ever even slated to go to Mexico in the first place. Trump and Pence, they pulled a dog and pony show on the numbers,  Jones said.  I almost threw up in my mouth. But that won t stop Trump from bragging, and it won t stop his supporters from continuing to buy his lies hook, line, and sinker every damn time.

       " 'The Republican war on poor people has been killing Americans and now we have the proof. A study published this week in the Journal of the American Medical Association shows clearly that poverty compounded by Republican refusal to spend money on the poor is unnecessarily shortening the lives of millions of people. We know that it s unnecessary because in the parts of the country where the poor are not treated like animals, they live longer.It s so bad that in some of the poorer parts of America, people have a life expectancy on par with developing African nations:The poor in some cities   big ones like New York and Los Angeles, and also quite a few smaller ones like Birmingham, Ala.   live nearly as long as their middle-class neighbors or have seen rising life expectancy in the 21st century. But in some other parts of the country, adults with the lowest incomes die on average as young as people in much poorer nations like Rwanda, and their life spans are getting shorter.Meanwhile, the rich continue to live longer because in America, even longevity is for sale to the highest bidder: the gap in life spans between rich and poor widened from 2001 to 2014. The top 1 percent in income among American men live 15 years longer than the poorest 1 percent; for women, the gap is 10 years. These rich Americans have gained three years of longevity just in this century. They live longer almost without regard to where they live.Here s the map put together by the New York Times color coded for average lifespan. Notice that most of the low-end life expectancy is located squarely in Republican controlled states:This is a direct result of Republicans refusing to lift a finger to help those most in need. Between refusing to expand Medicaid, savage cuts to food stamps and a general attitude of  die quickly,  conservative politics are killing people with their greed and inhumanity.But it s more than just a lack of access to doctors that is killing the poor. By denying them any kind of economic help, the poor are forced to eat junk food because that s all they can afford. By denying them a proper education and job opportunities, the poor are highly stressed, already bad for your health, and have been turning to drugs and alcohol to cope:Life expectancy for the poor is lowest in a large swath that cuts through the middle of the country, and it appears in pockets in the rest of the country, in places like Nevada. David M. Cutler, a Harvard economist and an author of the paper, calls it the  drug overdose belt,  because the area matches in part a map of where the nation s opioid epidemic is concentrated.The good news/bad news is that in the places where the poor are not treated like lepers, they love much longer and healthier lives. Birmingham, Alabama took numerous measures to improve the public s health and, shockingly, it helped:In the area in and around Birmingham, Ala., the life span for adults in the bottom quarter of income rose 3.8 years for men and 2.2 years for women from 2001 to 2014.Clearly, they must have used the big government to tell you what size soda to drink, right? Well, not so much:The county expanded availability of preventive health care like vaccinations and mammograms by opening clinics in poorer neighborhoods in the 1990s and early 2000s (though recently it has closed some of the clinics). Although a relatively high percentage of the population lacks health insurance, a portion of local taxes goes to hospital care for those who cannot pay. The county has been ahead of the rest of Alabama in banning smoking in restaurants and workplaces, with a law enacted in 2012. And philanthropic foundations backed by old industrial money have funded campaigns to make people healthier in the Birmingham area.If the Republican-controlled legislature of Alabama had expanded Medicaid instead of throwing a temper tantrum, these measures would be even MORE effective. Still, Birmingham proves that even with a state government dedicated to hurting the poor, local governments can, and do, still mitigate much of the damage.The bottom line here is that while the rich reap the benefits of better doctors, less stress and access to healthy foods, the poor in large swathes of the country are denied the same, mostly by the rich and their puppets in the Republican Party. The net result is that millions of people are dying before their time so a small group of people can amass more wealth and power. Sadly, this drive to succeed at the expense of others is the new American Dream.The only silver lining here is that many of those same poor people have finally, finally figured out that Republicans are not going to help them. Sure, they turned to Donald Trump for leadership but even after he s gone, they ll remember who s been stabbing them in the back for decades. They may never embrace the Democrats but maybe, just maybe, they ll start demanding Republicans stop catering to the rich while throwing the poor the crumbs.We can only hope.Featured image via NY Times',\n",
       " 'The average American makes about $50,000 a year   and too many Americans scrape by on much less. So how much does Trump pay his staff? According to the public filing of payroll released by the White House, an absurd amount, apparently.Since taking office, Trump has staffed his White House with a number of unquestionably unqualified people   including former reality tv stars. His only job requirement is that they be loyal to him   and he measures that loyalty in how well they lie for him on television. The most opportunistic of his staff has risen to that challenge and he subsequently paid them handsomely for the job. Of Trump s staff, a few people stick out for the ridiculous amount of money they make for doing, essentially, nothing:Omarosa, who was hired by Trump because she appeared on  The Apprentice  with him, makes $179,700 per year. It s entirely unclear what she does exactly. Likewise with scandal-laden Seb Gorka, who gets paid $155,000 but legally can t do the job Trump hired him for because he s so shady that intelligence officials wouldn t give him security clearance. Instead, he hangs out at the White House and collects a paycheck.Kellyanne Conway and Sean Spicer both get paid the same $179,700 that Omarosa does, but that money covers not only their jobs and expenses but also their human dignity. Both Trump staffers are required to repeatedly and shamelessly lie and defend Trump no matter what indefensible thing he said or did. Spicer at least has the decency to look like the toll is killing him inside. Conway appears to actually enjoy the dishonesty, and one suspects she would probably do the job for free if she had to.Hilariously, former Fox News host K.T. MacFarlane gets paid the same amount that Trump s top staff does, including Reince Priebus. She has been sidelined since her friend Michael Flynn was booted from his job and his replacement, H.R. McMasters told Trump he wouldn t take the job unless she was removed. Now she putters around the White House under the vague title  Assistant to the President  doing who knows what. For that, she earns $179,700.The release of the White House payroll only goes to show just how cartoonish Trump s administration is. Filled with disgraced lobbyists, Fox News hosts, former reality tv stars, and a variety of other opportunistic liars, it s no wonder the White House barely functions and is plagued with in-fighting, backstabbing, and scandals. It turns out, if you hire a bunch of clowns, the West Wing can fit an awful lot of them inside. Each cashing a paycheck for more than many Americans make in three years of work.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden will raise the minimum age at which workers can take their state pension over the coming years, a move designed to match an increase in average life spans, the major political parties said on Thursday. Workers can currently choose to take their state pension from the age of 61. This will be raised successively to 64 by 2026. The current pension system was designed around 20 years ago and Swedes now live around 2.5 years longer on average.  That is positive but it means that pensions ... have to last a longer time,  the parties said in a statement.  In order to maintain a good and sustainable pension level, therefore, people need to work longer.  The reforms will also make it harder for companies to get rid of people who want to continue to work after the mandatory pension age and tighten requirements for funds providers in the pension system after a number of scandals. [L8N1CU16Y]       The deal, which will not affect state finances either positively or negatively, was agreed between the minority coalition of the Social Democrats and Greens, the Moderates - the biggest opposition party - and the Center, Liberal and Christian Democrat parties.

       " 'Sounds like they should call themselves the Brownshirts, because that s what this group basically is.At Donald Trump rallies across the nation, his supporters have committed violence against protesters with little or no restraint   or consequences for that matter.One rally in North Carolina last week alone saw two black men get physically assaulted by racist white guys who clearly didn t care if they were being filmed or not, but they attacked their victims anyway despite not being provoked to do so. They didn t do it in self defense, but out of hatred and entitlement.Rallies in St. Louis and Chicago have nearly sparked race wars between white racists and protesters, and Trump has even led his supporters in a pledge that included the Nazi salute.Trump claims that his rallies are not violent and that no one has ever been injured at one of his events.So, it really comes as no surprise at all that a group of Trump supporters are actually forming a militia to beat up protesters who they claim are  Far-left agitators  and the real culprits committing violent acts.A group on Twitter called  Lion s Guard,  described themselves as  An informal civilian organization dedicated to protecting the safety and security of innocent, peaceful Trump supporters from violent Far-Left agitators. The group then tweeted out an invitation to other Trump supporters who would like to  forcefully protect  rallies and referred to themselves as the real victims of beatings and violence. Do you want to provide security protection to innocent people who are subject to harassment and assault by Far-left agitators? If so, you are welcome to join. That s the mission   to protect innocents who can t hire their own security guards. We are unarmed but willing to forcefully protect people if need be. We are *defensive*, *protective* of innocents who are being beaten and harassed for their political views. And then the page was taken down after the page owner received a threat, but they promised to create a website to coordinate actions the group takes.Here s a screenshot of the Twitter page via RT.Image via RTAgain, this group sounds like wannabe members of the Brownshirts who served Adolf Hitler during his rise to power in Germany, whose primary purpose was to provide protection for Nazi rallies and assemblies from those they deemed socialists and communists. At one such assembly in November 1919, Hitler s Brownshirt friends ejected hecklers by force by throwing them down the stairs. At another meeting in February 1920, dissenters who tried to shout Hitler down were violently removed. And in November 1921, a melee broke out when the Brownshirts attacked protesters during a Hitler speech.This is same kind of violence that is already occurring at Trump rallies across the country and now a group of his supporters are taking it a step further by creating a group dedicated to  forcefully  taking down protesters if a Trump supporter merely feels threatened.Trump has already been repeatedly labeled a fascist this month, and this new group only makes that label stick.

       " 'TRIPOLI (Reuters) - In a square behind Libya s central bank, black market dealers, some of them armed, carry small plastic bags filled with dollars and larger ones with dinars in and out of one of many informal exchanges. Traders buy food and other goods from abroad at the official rate and sell them at the unofficial one, pocketing vast profits; others make equally large sums by smuggling out heavily subsidized fuel. In the back streets of the old city meanwhile, ordinary people have resorted to selling jewelry or dollars hidden at home as six years of post-dictatorship chaos take their toll.  I haven t been paid for four months,  said Fatima, 40, from the southern city of Sabha as she sold three small gold charms to pay for diabetes treatment for her sister, Hasina, who added:  We re helpless, there s nothing else we can do.  In other signs of rising poverty, elderly women beg motorists for cash on Tripoli s streets and families queue for charity food handouts. The U.N. estimated that about 1.3 million people in Libya need humanitarian assistance this year. Their situation took another turn for the worse in the past two weeks after the black market rate of the dinar, which has long languished at record lows, slid again, fuelling inflation that is already around 25-30 percent. The central bank blamed the audit bureau and the U.N.-backed government for restricting letters of credit that fund basic supplies to a divided country where a security vacuum and smuggling networks have destabilized the wider region. Officials had come across suspect requests - one to import tuna worth $120,000, more than the country consumes in a year, according to a Libyan entrepreneur who declined to be named, fearing retribution from Libya s powerful armed groups. Just $2.5 billion of an expected $7.4 billion of credit has been allocated, the trader said, helping knock the dinar from around 8.5 to 9.25 against the dollar on the black market. Its value has fallen by more than 600 percent since early 2014. The economy ministry was not immediately available for comment on a complex credit system that passes through commercial banks and where the audit bureau had documented earlier abuses and lack of oversight.  We re talking about an extremely bad economic and financial situation,  Central Bank Governor Sadiq al-Kabir said in a rare news conference on Tuesday.  Everyone, whether legislative or executive, holds responsibility equally.  Traders and economists say political uncertainty is a major factor weakening the currency, with U.N. talks to broker a deal between rival factions currently suspended. Libya is struggling to fund food imports and defend its foreign reserves, which the World Bank estimates will stand at $67.5 billion at the end of this year, compared to $123.5 billion in 2012. International experts say the only way to resolve the issue is to devalue the dinar from the official exchange rate of 1.37 to the dollar, but agreeing an economic strategy in a country dominated by armed factions with rival governments and no budgets is no simple task. A powerful or well-connected minority who are profiting from a flourishing shadow economy have little interest in change.      The central bank did not comment on devaluation, but economists and diplomats say the bank is reluctant to devalue without a policy plan in place to deal with the resulting shock. Libya managed this year to lift oil production to about 1 million barrels a day, but output is stuck well below the levels before the 2011 uprising that toppled Muammar Gaddafi. Revenues that normally account for about 80 percent of gross domestic product are largely used to pay salaries, including those of armed factions added to the state payroll for their role in the uprising. Subsidies include a $4 billion-plus annual fuel subsidy that is among the most generous in the world. Premiums on the official exchange rate and subsidized fuel make Libya  a criminal and terrorist cross-border funding paradise , said Husni Bey, chairman of HB Group, one of Libya s biggest private firms.  Most instability in Libya today is of a criminal nature... due to the lack of equitable exchange rate for the Libyan dinar and the subsidies that must be changed from goods to direct cash contributions.  Last year Libya spent around $26 billion, but earned just $6 billion.  This year we estimate that revenues should increase to around $14 billion, but spending will likely be more than double this,  said Mark Griffiths, Libya Mission Chief for the International Monetary Fund.  This is not sustainable.   The government has sought to reduce the public salary bill by 5 billion dinars annually, clamping down on abuse by removing some 100,000 people who had been claiming several salaries, according to a finance ministry report. Libyans became used to plentiful public jobs and state handouts as Gaddafi sought to buy loyalty like other Middle Eastern oil producers. Migrant workers used to do the manual work, now Libyans without contacts have taken their place. Salman Rashid, a public servant, said he had received just three months-worth of pay in the past year.  It s not enough for basic needs,  he said.  Now I work on construction sites and in buildings maintenance.  Entrepreneurs have withdrawn deposits from banks for fear of employees leaking word of them to kidnappers and others also prefer to keep money at home. In a second shop in the old city, a woman who gave her name as Karima was changing 500 euros.  I need to go to Tunis for surgery and am selling my foreign currency holdings,  she said.  Times are very difficult now.  Shop owner Salahedin Zarti, 52, said up to 10 people come in daily to sell necklaces, bracelets and rings.  In the beginning it was every day, but now I think people are starting to run out of jewelry,  he said. ',\n",

Since being elected last month, Trump has ben naming the dirtiest, swampiest monsters to head his cabinet and Administration. Bankers, donors, politicians galore are lining up to turn the United States into a fascist regime for the rich and powerful.Yet, somehow, his voters don t believe it for a second. They re still convinced he s going to drain the swamp, and anyone who says otherwise is just trying to tear him down.Only New Gingrich, and his all-knowing wisdom, inadvertently has exposed Trump for the fraud he really is. Talking to NPR s  Morning Edition,  the former Speaker (who left in disgrace), told reporters that Donald Trump will no longer be using the  cute  slogan of  drain the swamp  because it s not going to happen:I m told he now just disclaims that. He now says it was cute, but he doesn t want to use it anymore   [He had] written what I thought was a very cute tweet about  the alligators are complaining,  but somebody wrote back and said they were tired of hearing this stuff.And just like that, another Trump promise   and one of his biggest   goes down in flames because the elite Republicans (which includes Gingrich) don t want to hear it anymore. So that makes Trump either a liar or a turtle-on-a-fencepost. Or both. Gingrich added that  he s in a different role now, and maybe he feels that as president, as the next president of the United States, that he should be marginally more dignified than talking about alligators in swamps. Not only is he being  more dignified  than th alligators, he s giving them government positions   like the Treasury Department, the SEC, and even the Transportation Department.And just like that, Trump drops another thing people trusted him with.

       " 'During a recent interview on CNN with Donald Trump, the real estate mogul denied knowing anything about former KKK Grand Wizard David Duke and the Ku Klux Klan. He was even asked by Jake Tapper if he would disavow any endorsements by white supremacists and white supremacy groups. Trump responded: I don t know anything about David Duke. I don t know anything about what you are even talking about with white supremacy or white supremacists. So, I don t know. I mean, did he endorse me or what s going on? Because I know nothing about David Duke, I know nothing about white supremacists. And so, you are asking me a question that I m supposed to be talking about people that I know nothing about. When pressed further, Trump had the audacity to say, regarding the KKK: Well, I have to look at the group. I mean, I don t know what group you re talking about. You wouldn t want me to condemn a group that I know nothing about. I d have to look. If you would send me a list of the groups, I will do research on them, and certainly I would disavow if I thought that there was something wrong. You can t acknowledge off the top of your head that what the KKK stands for is horrifying?Well, the White House has now offered their response to Donald Trump s pathetic answers surrounding David Duke and the KKK. Press Secretary Josh Earnest, during a press conference on Monday, stated: I think my observation is simply that, you know Mr. Trump says that there s more that he needs to learn about Mr. Duke before he can render an opinion. But I think we now know all we need to know about Mr. Trump to render our personal opinion of his candidacy. Earnest, in so many words, just pretty much insinuated that most sane-minded people should be able to surmise that Donald Trump not only embraces his racist base of support, but is likely racist himself. Who the hell doesn t know what the KKK is and who David Duke is? Trump s playing dumb, because he knows most of his base is in full support of open racism. It s how Trump has run his campaign from the start.And yes, Earnest is correct, we no know all we need to know about Donald Trump to render our own personal opinions. If you re a Trump supporter at this point, you re likely racist. That s just a fact. If you re not, WTF are you doing?

Minus 18 wrote on the event page: Imagine being told by your school that the clothes you feel comfortable wearing to a formal aren t considered  normal  or don t conform to a dress code. Imagine not being allowed to take a partner of the same sex, or being too afraid to attend altogether. It isn t unusual for LGBTQ teens to be bullied or banned when they try to bring a same-sex date or wear attire that doesn t satisfy strict gender norms. The Formal is a place where teens can be themselves and feel comfortable wearing whatever with whomever, without worrying that others will take issue with it. Knowing just how important LGBTQ events are, Minus 18 was also crowdfunding for any students who couldn t afford their $40 tickets to the dance.Unfortunately, some people just can t let others be. The Stop Safe Schools Coalition, a conservative group of bigots that go out of their way to ruin schools and groups that foster safe and inclusive environments for same-sex attracted, intersex, and gender diverse students, staff and families,  decided to try and ruin the gala.Using their 700+ Facebook fans, the right-wing group begged people to buy up as many tickets as possible so that LGBTQ teens wouldn t be able to. The group posted: The more tickets sold to us the more youth we protect. They are non-refundable unfortunately so if you are then unable to attend you can t get your money back or a ticket sold to someone else. Little did they know, that while these homophobes thought they were robbing tickets from LGBTQ teens, they were actually buying them FOR the teens! What The Stop Safe Schools Coalition had actually done was share Minus 18 s crowdfunding campaign   which allowed conservatives to unknowingly making donations to send needy LGBTQ students TO the dance. As one person hilariously pointed out on the Facebook page: You realize that if the conservatives do buy all the tickets, you can just allow registered people on a waiting list in for free? They re effectively subsidizing tickets for those who can t buy one. This is one time where the stupidity of conservatives actually paid off. Thanks to their ignorance, Minus 18 DOUBLED their crowdfunding goal of $15,000 for 500 tickets.

       " 'VATICAN CITY (Reuters) - The funeral of Cardinal Bernard Law, who resigned as Archbishop of Boston 15 years ago after covering up years of sexual abuse of children by priests, was held in the Vatican on Thursday without a mention of what led to his downfall. About 200 people attended the funeral Mass in a chapel in the apse of St. Peter s Basilica and presided over by a senior cardinal, Angelo Sodano. The wooden coffin lay on the floor with an open book of the gospels resting on it. Pope Francis entered the chapel for a few minutes after the Mass to bless the coffin and conduct a brief service known as the Final Commendation and Farewell - which he does for all  cardinals who die in Rome.  He dedicated his whole life to the Church,  Sodano said in his homily in praise of Law, who died on Wednesday.  Sodano listed the stages of Law s clerical life and said the late Pope John Paul had  called him to Rome  to be archpriest of a Rome basilica. But Sodano made no mention of the reason why he left Boston.  Unfortunately, each of us can sometimes be lacking in our mission,  Sodano said. The pope read out a Latin prayer, part of which reads:  May he be given a merciful judgement . About 15 cardinals attended, though not Law s successor in Boston, Cardinal Sean O Malley. O Malley said on Wednesday that Law served at a time  when the Church failed seriously in its responsibilities ...  Law was Archbishop of Boston for 18 years when he resigned on Dec. 13, 2002, climaxing a tumultuous year that sparked the greatest crisis in the history of the American Catholic Church. A succession of devastating news stories by Boston Globe reporters showed how priests who sexually abused children had been moved from parish to parish for years under Law s tenure without parishioners or law authorities being informed. Victims groups have expressed outrage that Law s funeral was being in St. Peter s and that he would be buried in a crypt in a chapel of the Rome Basilica of Santa Maria Maggiore, where he served as archpriest.  Survivors of child sexual assault in Boston, who were first betrayed by Law s cover-up of sex crimes and then doubly betrayed by his subsequent promotion to Rome, were those most hurt,  SNAP, a victim s group, said in a statement on Wednesday. After Pope Francis left Thursday s funeral, two nuns in brown robes knelt by the coffin and arched over it to pray. After the funeral, Cardinal Franc Rode of Slovenia praised Law as  a good man with good intentions .  All these provisions about paedophilia were not as severe as they are now so one can t say that he made that many mistakes,  Rode told Reuters Television, saying it was  another era . He did not elaborate. About a half dozen ambassadors attended. The United States  official representative was Louis Bono, the current chief of mission at the U.S. Embassy to the Vatican. U.S. Ambassador-designate Callista Gingrich and her husband Newt Gingrich, former speaker of the House of Representatives, attended in a private capacity.

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - Polarized by years of civil war, Syrians were split on Friday over a U.S. strike on a government airbase, with those in rebel-held areas cautiously welcoming it but Damascus residents decrying it as Western aggression. The cruise missile strike near the city of Homs early in the day came in response to what Washington and its allies said was a chemical weapons attack this week by Syrian forces. Damascus has strongly denied using chemical weapons. Some residents of Idlib province, where the chemical attack took place killing scores of people, said they hoped the U.S. strike would weaken Assad’s government. “The American strike was good, it’s positive - we support any strike against the Syrian regime,” 29-year-old Alaa al-Zir said. “We hope there will be more strikes - and other action - to follow ... so the revolutionaries can advance further and these massacres against civilians can stop,” he said. Another man, Qadi Hajj Qadur, said the strike was likely too little, too late from the United States under new President Donald Trump, but that it was still a positive development and signaled hope for an end to the conflict. “It’s been seven years and we’ve experienced killing and they (the international community) didn’t impose a no-fly zone, they didn’t do anything. “Now America has come and wants to defend us. Is Trump a friend? I don’t know. But hopefully something good will come from him, and there will be a (peace) agreement, and this corrupt regime which slaughtered people can be gone.” Syria’s opposition has long urged the creation of a no-fly zone or provision of anti-aircraft weapons to rebel groups, and criticized what it saw as U.S. inaction under Barack Obama. Trump’s decision to launch missiles at a Syrian government target marks a dramatic departure and was welcomed by the opposition, who called for further strikes. Syria’s government controls most of the west of the country including its largest population centers, but rebels still hold Idlib province as a stronghold, with pockets of control in other areas including outside Damascus. The Damascus government said the U.S. strike was “rash” and an act of “flagrant aggression”, but did not expect a bigger escalation.  In an interview with the Lebanese TV station al-Mayadeen, Assad aide Bouthaina Shaaban said any Syrian who welcomed the strike was a traitor. Damascus residents struck a defiant tone, echoing the government’s vow to escalate the pace of its attacks on insurgents and to win back the whole country. Others said the U.S. attack was no surprise and vowed to stand up to Washington. “Talk in the U.N. Security Council about (Syria using) chemical weapons is lies, and Syria knows this. They just wanted to have an excuse to strike,” said a Damascus fireman, who did not give his name. “It doesn’t make a great difference anyway. What the militants (rebels) have done to our country has more of an effect than Tomahawk missiles.” “The blood of martyrs is what waters the earth of the country. Either we die, or we win,” he said.

       " 'Are you paying attention America? Yesterday, the UK voted to leave the European Union. On referendum day, Lord Ashcroft surveyed 12,369 people after they had voted to help explain the result   who voted for which outcome, and what lay behind their decision.Lord Ashcroft polls   70% of Muslims voted to remain in the UE. This provides additional refutation of the claim made by our rulers that immigration doesn t change anything. In the Scottish referendum, a majority of people born in Scotland voted for independence; it was the votes of (first-generation) immigrants that swayed the result in favour of maintaining the United Kingdom. Now, in this second referendum, the British people as a whole might well have lost their independence because of the votes of African and Asian colonists who only arrived in their country within the last few decades. In the end, this was narrowly averted. But it shows the extent to which the demographic window is closing on the hopes for European survival.White voters voted to leave the EU by 53% to 47%. Two thirds (67%) of those describing themselves as Asian voted to remain, as did three quarters (73%) of black voters. Nearly six in ten (58%) of those describing themselves as Christian voted to leave; seven in ten Muslims voted to remain.A majority of those who backed the Conservative in 2015 voted to leave the EU (58%), as did more than 19 out of 20 UKIP supporters. Nearly two thirds of Labour and SNP voters (63% and 64%), seven in ten Liberal Democrats and three quarters of Greens, voted to remain.Nearly half (49%) of leave voters said the biggest single reason for wanting to leave the EU was  the principle that decisions about the UK should be taken in the UK . One third (33%) said the main reason was that leaving  offered the best chance for the UK to regain control over immigration and its own borders.  Just over one in eight (13%) said remaining would mean having no choice  about how the EU expanded its membership or its powers in the years ahead.  Only just over one in twenty (6%) said their main reason was that  when it comes to trade and the economy, the UK would benefit more from being outside the EU than from being part of it. A small majority of those who voted to remain think that for most children growing up today, life will be better than it was for their parents; leavers think the opposite by 61% to 39%. Leavers see more threats than opportunities to their standard of living from the way the economy and society are changing, by 71% to 29%   more than twice the margin among remainers.Nearly three quarters (73%) of remainers think life in Britain is better today than it was 30 years ago; a majority (58%) of those who voted to leave say it is worse.

       " 'KOSAMBI, Indonesia (Reuters) - Two explosions tore through a fireworks factory on the outskirts of Indonesia s capital on Thursday, killing at least 47 people and injuring dozens. It was one of Indonesia s worst industrial disasters and is likely to cast a new spotlight on lax safety standards in the Southeast Asian country, where rules are often ignored or weakly enforced. Workers had no time to escape from the plant in Tangerang, an industrial and manufacturing hub to the west of Jakarta, after the explosions that one neighbor described as a  roar  that could be heard miles away. A video of the scene inside the warehouse, widely shared on social media, showed charred bodies sprawled about the burnt-out factory, and Reuters reporters at the scene saw grass scorched over an area about 10 meters (33 feet) from the site.  People were burned so badly you couldn t see their faces ... It was really bad,  said search and rescue official Deden Nurjaman, who expected the death toll to climb as more bodies were found inside the factory. Fireworks are frequently used in Indonesia for religious and other celebrations, and are widely available. There have been a series of major fires in Indonesia this year, including one that engulfed one of Jakarta s main markets. Thick, dark plumes of smoke billowed from the factory through the afternoon as an inferno took hold. As night fell, the PT Panca Buana Cahaya Sukses warehouse was still smoldering and there was a stench of chemicals and burning plastic. Jakarta police spokesman Argo Yuwono told Metro Television that 47 bodies had been discovered, 46 people were injured and 10 people were unaccounted for. He said the missing might have left with light injuries or not have been working at the time. One of the first policemen on the scene, Raymond Masengi, told Metro TV that he and other officers had to smash holes in the factory wall to help the injured escape. Fiza, a doctor in the emergency unit at Tangerang General Hospital, said he was treating seven people, some of them with burns to more than 80 percent of their bodies. Three were in critical condition. A nearby mosque held prayers for the victims. Forensic police worked in fading light to examine the debris, setting up a few floodlights to try and establish the cause of the blaze.  Yuwono said police were looking into the permit of the factory, which was close to a school and housing and - according to media reports - had been operating for only two months.     A witness who lives around the corner from the factory said she heard an explosion  like a roar .  I dressed and stepped outside the house, and saw the flames, they were almost in my face. The smoke, the heat was in my face. I panicked, I was scared, I picked up my son and ran away from the fire,  said Kartini, 40, who uses one name, like many Indonesians. Hundreds of children at a school just 100 meters (yards) from the factory jumped in terror over a wall as the explosions boomed, dropping books and bags in their haste to get away.  Science teacher Asep Mahmud, 47, said:  There were several small explosions and then one really big one that shook our buildings and desks.

       " \"Well, well, well As a famous  reverend  once said, Obama s  chickens have come home too roost OR AS MIKE HUCKABEE SAID:.@GovMikeHuckabee: I think it's easier to find Bigfoot and Amelia Earhart than it is to find collusion between the Russians and Donald Trump pic.twitter.com/RA68QqD9kG  Fox News (@FoxNews) October 29, 2017Obama for America (OFA), the former president s political organization, has directed nearly a million dollars to the very same law firm that funneled money to Fusion GPS, the firm behind the infamous Steele dossier.Since April of 2016, Obama For America (OFA) has paid over $972,000 to Perkins Coie, records filed with the Federal Election Commission (FEC) show.The Washington Post reported last week that Perkins Coie, an international law firm, was directed by both the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton s campaign to retain Fusion GPS in April of 2016 to dig up dirt on then-candidate Donald Trump. Fusion GPS then hired Christopher Steele, a former British spy, to compile a dossier of allegations that Trump and his campaign actively colluded with the Russian government during the 2016 election. Though many of the claims in the dossier have been directly refuted, none of the dossier s allegations of collusion have been independently verified. Lawyers for Steele admitted in court filings last April that his work was not verified and was never meant to be made public.FEC records as well as federal court records show that Marc Elias, the Perkins Coie lawyer whom the Washington Post reported was responsible for the payments to Fusion GPS on behalf of Clinton s campaign and the DNC, also previously served as a counsel for OFA. In Shamblin v. Obama for America, a 2013 case in federal court in Florida, federal court records list Elias as simultaneously serving as lead attorney for both OFA and the DNC.OFA, which managed Obama s successful re-election campaign in 2012, retooled after that campaign to focus on enacting the president s agenda during his final term in office. The group reorganized again after the 2016 election and planned to use its staff and resources to oppose President Donald Trump. During the entire 2016 campaign cycle, the group spent only $4.5 million, according to FEC records.Federal records show that Hillary Clinton s official campaign organization, Hillary For America, paid just under $5.1 million to Perkins Coie in 2016. The DNC paid nearly $5.4 million to the law firm in 2016.The timing and nature of the payments to Perkins Coie by Obama s official campaign arm raise significant questions about whether OFA was funding Fusion GPS, how much Obama and his team knew about the contents and provenance of the dossier long before its contents were made public, and whether the president or his government lieutenants knowingly used a partisan political document to justify official government actions targeting the president s political opponents named in the dossier. According to the Washington Post, Fusion GPS was first retained by Perkins Coie on behalf of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) and Hillary Clinton s presidential campaign in April of 2016.At the same time that Hillary s campaign, Obama s campaign organization, and the DNC were simultaneously paying Perkins Coie, the spouse of one of Fusion GPS s key employees was working directly for Obama in the West Wing. Shailagh Murray, a former Washington Post reporter-turned-political operative, was serving as a top communications adviser to Obama while the Obama administration was reportedly using information from the dossier to justify secret surveillance of Trump campaign staff. Murray is married to Neil King, a former Wall Street Journal reporter who was hired by Fusion GPS in December of 2016. While at the Wall Street Journal, King worked alongside Fusion GPS s core team, even sharing bylines with Glenn Simpson, the Fusion GPS executive who personally hired Steele to probe Trump s alleged Russia connections.As you might suspect,  Neil King was a thick as thieves with CNN, the WSJ and the Washington Post. The lines between investigating the truth and fake news were blurred in a big way when King and Catan jumped from the WSJ to Fusion GPS. As the Daily Caller reported:CNN s reporting on the Trump-Russia dossier has left out at least one crucial fact: the close ties between the network and the opposition research firm at the center of the dossier controversy.CNN s reporting on the dossier, led by justice correspondent Evan Perez, has been favorable to the firm, Fusion GPS, and hyped the dossier s credibility. Left out of Perez s reporting, which has relied largely on unnamed sources, is his personal closeness to Fusion GPS  operatives. Fusion has repeatedly been described in Senate testimonies as a smear-for-hire operation that manufactures misleading or false media narratives for its clients. Another Fusion founder, Tom Catan, worked as a reporter for the Journal at the same time as Perez and Simpson. The third Fusion co-founder, Peter Fritsch, worked above Perez and Simpson as the senior national security editor.KING (FUSION GPS) ON THE RIGHT -Photo posted on Facebook by Perez (CNN)Simpson and Fritsch left the WSJ in 2011 to launch Fusion. Perez jumped from the paper to CNN in 2013. Another longtime Journal reporter, Neil King, left the paper to join Fusion in December 2016.PEREZ ( LEFT) AND ALL OF FUSION The importance of the fake dossier and how it was shopped around to the press comes into focus when you realize that Obama, Clinton and the DNC had Fusion GPS create this smear campaign on Trump. This also opened the door for the phony Russia collusion investigation whereby the Trump campaign and family members were spied on because of something fake.Read more: The Federalist \",\n",

       " 'NAIROBI (Reuters) - South Sudan s army clashed with rebels in an oil-producing region early on Sunday, both sides said, shattering a ceasefire hours after it came into effect.  Both sides accused the other of starting the fighting around the town of Koch in Unity state. Seventeen aid workers fled the violence, according to a humanitarian source. There were no immediate details of casualties. The government and rebel groups signed a ceasefire on Thursday in the latest attempt to end a four-year civil war and let humanitarian groups reach civilians. The ceasefire formally came into force on Sunday morning, but fighting broke out soon afterwards, according to a humanitarian security report seen by Reuters.   Our forces came under heavy fire this morning in Koch county,  Dickson Gatluak, a spokesman for the government side, said.  Our forces acted in self defense and repulsed the attacking forces and defeated them,  he added in a statement. Rebel spokesman Lam Paul Gabriel said the army attacked first and rebel forces were now pursuing government soldiers towards the town.  The world s youngest country plunged into war in late 2013 after President Salva Kiir sacked his deputy, Riek Machar.  The dispute erupted into fighting that spread across the country, largely along ethnic lines between forces loyal to Kiir, who is Dinka, and Machar, who is Nuer.  The violence, which the United Nations says has amounted to ethnic cleansing, has forced a third of the population to flee.  Earlier this year, pockets of the country plunged briefly into famine.

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump’s lawyers told a New York state judge on Tuesday that under the U.S. Constitution she had no jurisdiction over the president and therefore urged her to dismiss a defamation lawsuit by a woman who has accused Trump of sexual harassment. The lawsuit by Summer Zervos, a former contestant on Trump’s reality show “The Apprentice,” contends that Trump’s denials of her accusations amounted to false and defamatory statements. Being “branded a liar” by Trump, the lawsuit said, has harmed her and her business.  Trump’s lawyers, led by Marc Kasowitz, said the Constitution’s Supremacy Clause prevented the judge from letting Zervos’s lawsuit proceed in a state court.  The hour-long hearing was held in New York State Supreme Court in Manhattan, where Zervos’s lawyers responded that there was no legal precedent preventing a state court from ruling on the conduct of a president outside his official duties.  “The motion today has nothing to do with putting anyone above the law,” Kasowitz told Justice Jennifer Schecter. Under the Supremacy Clause, he said, “a state court may not exercise jurisdiction over the president of the United States while he or she is in office.” Schecter occasionally stopped Kasowitz to ask him to clarify his views on her jurisdiction. She asked him if it mattered that she would not be directing the president in his official duties, only potentially ruling on whether his comments as a candidate defamed Zervos. Kasowitz said it made no difference.  “What that means is the president being haled into court, and once the president is haled into court there are innumerable obligations that flow from that,” he said, saying this would amount to inappropriate “control” over the president. Mariann Wang, the lead lawyer for Zervos, argued, “There is no case that holds that a federal official cannot be held to account in a state court.”  Trump’s lawyers did not dispute this.  Wang acknowledged that the president holds a unique position but noted that even the president has downtime. They could, for example, meet Trump during one of his weekend visits to his Mar-A-Lago resort in Florida to record a video deposition, she suggested. The judge said she would rule later. Trump’s lawyers have said in court filings that Zervos is making false, self-contradictory and politically motivated accusations and that the president’s remarks were “non-actionable fiery rhetoric.” Zervos has accused Trump of groping her during meetings in 2007. She filed her lawsuit in January, three days before Trump’s inauguration. In March, she subpoenaed Trump’s presidential campaign for any documents concerning similar allegations against him.  Trump has said accusations by Zervos and other women who last year accused him of sexual harassment are false. If the case went ahead, it could lead to Trump being compelled to hand over any documents from his campaign related to any accusations of sexual impropriety made against him.  Zervos’s lawyers, including Gloria Allred, have cited the U.S. Supreme Court’s ruling in Clinton v. Jones, which allowed former Arkansas state employee Paula Jones’ sexual harassment lawsuit against Bill Clinton to proceed in 1997 while he was still U.S. president.  The decision led to Clinton’s impeachment after he lied under oath about his sexual relationship with another woman, Monica Lewinsky. Trump’s lawyers have said that Clinton v. Jones only applies to lawsuits in federal courts, not state courts. Zervos met Trump after becoming a contestant on NBC’s “The Apprentice” in 2005. She has accused Trump of kissing her against her will at his New York office in 2007 and later groping her in a hotel in Beverley Hills after she met with him about a possible job. She was one of several women who made accusations against Trump after the emergence last year of a conversation caught on an open microphone in 2005 in which he spoke in vulgar terms about trying to have sex with women. Trump has said the comments amounted to “locker room banter,” and his campaign issued a statement in which he apologized if anyone was offended. Since the lawsuit was filed, numerous accusations of sexual misconduct have been made against powerful men in politics, media and entertainment.  ',\n",
       " 'PARIS (Reuters) - France, Germany, Italy and Spain want digital multinationals like Amazon and Google to be taxed in Europe based on their revenues, rather than only profits as now, their finance ministers said in a joint letter. France is leading a push to clamp down on the taxation of such companies, but has found support from other countries also frustrated at the low tax they receive under current international rules.     Currently such companies are often taxed on profits booked by subsidiaries in low-tax countries like Ireland even though the revenue originated from other EU countries.  We should no longer accept that these companies do business in Europe while paying minimal amounts of tax to our treasuries,  the four ministers wrote in a letter seen by Reuters. The letter, signed by French Finance Minister Bruno Le Maire, Wolfgang Schaeuble of Germany, Pier-Carlo Padoan of Italy and Luis de Guindos, was addressed to the EU s Estonian presidency with the bloc s executive Commission in copy. They urged the Commission to come up with a solution creating an  equalization tax  on turnover that would bring taxation to the level of corporate tax in the country where the revenue was earned.  The amounts raised would aim to reflect some of what these companies should be paying in terms of corporate tax,  the ministers said in the letter, first reported on by the Financial Times. Le Maire, Schaeuble, Padoan and de Guindos of Spain said they wanted to present the issue to other EU counterparts at a Sept. 15-16 meeting in Tallinn. The EU s current Estonian presidency has scheduled a discussion at the meeting about the concept of  permanent establishment , with the aim of making it possible to tax firms where they create value, not only where they have their tax residence. France has stepped up pressure for EU tax rules after facing legal setbacks trying to obtain payments for taxes on activities in the country. A French court ruled in July French court ruled that Google, now part of Alphabet Inc, was not liable to pay 1.1 billion euros ($1.3 billion) in back taxes because it had no  permanent establishment  in France and ran its operations there from Ireland.

       " 'Paul Ryan is just like all the other establishment politicians from both sides of the aisle who have sold the American worker down the river for cheap labor. Foreign workers have been coming in to America by the droves to take over jobs that Americans had. In some cases, the American worker is required to train the foreign worker who s taking their job. Disney has been called out on doing this to its workers who fought back against it. The Chamber of Commerce is in the pocket of the establishment and they are all for more and more immigration that will ultimately hurt the American worker. In a Tuesday morning interview with radio host Bill Bennett,Paul Ryan defended his omnibus bill s controversial expansion in the H-2B visa program, which would allow foreign workers to fill blue-collar American jobs, by arguing that if the provision were not included, American companies would be forced to shut their doors.Bennett pressed Ryan on the details of the H-2B visa expansion, slipped 700-pages into Ryan s 2,009-page omnibus spending bill asking Ryan directly,  Do you believe there are not enough Americans to fill these jobs? In response, Ryan described the H-2B visa expansion as  a very small, discrete provision. Despite the nation s high levels of unemployment and stagnating wages, Ryan continued on to assert, without offering evidence in support of his claim, that corporations are facing a shortage of labor, which rendered the provision necessary. Ryan said:The reason that this was passed is because there was some seasonal surge jobs that they can t find local workers to fill, like the seafood packaging industry in Chesapeake Bay. You have seafood season, you need people to package those things, to can them. In the North, we have the summer tourism industry. What it is is there s seasonal industries where they can t find local people to do the jobs: kids are already in college or things like that where you have a surge in workers.Ryan explained that the provision was passed specifically  to help small business who cannot find labor when there s a surge in demand for their labor like seafood processing, or tourism. Ryan warned,  The point is these businesses would have shut down without this and that s what we didn t want to see happen. We didn t want to see businesses, who are seasonal, shut down because they couldn t get the labor. That s why this provision was passed in July. The data, however, demonstrates Ryan s claim to be unsubstantiated. As Sen. Jeff Sessions (R-AL)80% has highlighted, the Economic Policy Institute has documented how,  wages were stagnant or declining for workers in all of the top 15 H-2B occupations between 2004 and 2014. Unemployment rates increased in all but one of the top 15 H-2B occupations between 2004 and 2014, and all 15 occupations averaged very high unemployment rates  Flat and declining wages coupled with such high unemployment rates over such a long period of time suggest a loose labor market an over-supply of workers rather than an under-supply.Cries of so-called  labor shortages  are frequently invoked by corporations and immigration expansionist who want to see large increases in low-wage labor. As immigration attorney Ian Smith has explained, Ryan s resurrection and expansion of the controversial provision in Sen. Marco Rubio s Gang of Eight bill to increase guest-worker programs will disproportionately  hurt America s most vulnerable workers  such as black workers, single women, the elderly, and first-generation immigrants.While Ryan argues that more low-wage immigrant labor is needed to fill labor shortages, National Review s Rich Lowry has previously declared,  The next time I hear a Republican strategist or a Republican politician say that there are jobs that Americans won t do, that person should be shot, he should be hanged, he should be wrapped in a carpet and thrown in the Potomac River. Ryan s push to expand immigration comes on top of the nation s existing federal policy of autopilot visa dispensations. Under current policy, every day the U.S. brings in enough new immigrants to fill an overcrowded, metropolitan high school. Every week, the United States brings in enough new immigrants to fill the Staples Center, where the Los Angeles Lakers play. Every year, we add an immigrant population the size of Dallas. And every three years, the U.S. adds another entire city of Los Angeles, made up of foreign-born immigrants.Ryan, however, seems to believe these numbers should be even bigger, even as the U.S. foreign-born population is already at an all-time high of 42.4 million.Perhaps the most unusual aspect of Ryan s using conservative talk radio platforms to make arguments for expanded immigration is that the Republican Party is now in the position of having an electorate that is almost universally opposed (92 percent according to Pew) to immigration increases, but it is led by a House Speaker who has a two-decade long history of pushing for higher rates of immigration. This means that one segment of the electorate, perhaps most in favor of immigration reductions, now has as its leader one of the politicians most associated with pushing for expanded immigration.Read more: Breitbart',\n",
       " 'COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh/YANGON (Reuters) - Thousands of Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar are trying to cross the border with Bangladesh, Bangladeshi security officials said on Saturday, as fresh fighting erupted in Myanmar s northwestern Rakhine state.  The death toll from widespread attacks staged by Rohingya insurgents on Friday has climbed to 96, including nearly 80 insurgents and 12 members of the security forces, the government said, prompting it to evacuate staff and villagers from some areas. The attacks marked a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since last October, when a similar offensive prompted a major military sweep beset by allegations of serious human rights abuses. The treatment of approximately 1.1 million Muslim Rohingya in mainly Buddhist Myanmar has emerged as the biggest challenge for national leader Aung San Suu Kyi, who late on Friday condemned the morning raids - in which insurgents wielding guns, sticks and homemade bombs assaulted 30 police stations and an army base. The Nobel Peace Prize laureate has been accused by some Western critics of not speaking out for the long-persecuted Muslim minority, and of defending the army s counteroffensive after the October attacks. Some 3,000 Rohingya arrived at the Naf river separating Myanmar and Bangladesh on Saturday, Manzurul Hassan Khan, a Bangladeshi border guard commander, told Reuters.  About 500 Rohingya, mostly women and children, spent the last night in a marshy area waiting to cross over,  said Khan.  We protected them the whole night. Today they went back.  Reuters reporters saw hundreds of Rohingya crossing into Bangladesh near the border village of Gumdhum as gun shots could be heard from the Myanmar side. They could be seen squatting in a marshy area, hiding in the bushes from border guards.  We managed to escape the shooting in Myanmar and tried to enter Bangladesh. We waited all night after we were pushed backed by Bangladesh border guards last night. This morning, we managed to enter somehow,  said Hamid Hossain, 42, who crossed into Bangladesh on Saturday with a group of three families. A 25-year-old man whose relatives said he had been shot by Myanmar security forces on Friday died as he was carried to Bangladesh for treatment. He was buried near a refugee camp close to the border on Saturday, according to camp resident Mohammed Shafi, who said he witnessed the burial. Bangladesh s foreign ministry on Saturday said it was concerned that thousands of  unarmed Myanmar nationals  had assembled near the border to enter the country.  Rohingya have been fleeing Myanmar to Bangladesh since the early 1990s and there are now around 400,000 in the country, where they are a source of tension between the two nations who both regard them as the other country s citizens.  In Myanmar, the government said there had been several large clashes involving hundreds of Rohingya across northwestern Rakhine on Saturday. The fiercest fighting took place on the outskirts of the major town of Maungdaw, near the Alodaw Pyae Buddhist monastery. Maungdaw resident Nay Myo Lin, 27, told Reuters by telephone that security forces opened fire on scores of what appeared to be Muslim men with guns near the monastery.  Police shot at them to break up the group and then the men shot back in the direction of the entrance gate of the city,  said Nay Myo Lin.  As the fighting went on throughout the day, I was stuck in the monastery and didn t dare to go out. When the sound of gunshots stopped, I ran to my house,  he said. Fearful Rakhine Buddhist residents in Maungdaw town gathered in homes while men stood guard by the windows, said Ohmar Lin, a female resident of the town.  We don t go out of the house, but I am ready to fight - we are prepared with knives and sticks to protect ourselves if they come here,  she said. The United Nations security team has sent an internal update to staff about the clashes, seen by Reuters, saying that Myanmar government officials had assured the U.N.  about their readiness to provide troops to secure our compounds if it becomes necessary . The government said in a statement that:  Extremist Bengali terrorists are attacking using man-made mines ... swords, sticks, guns. They also killed Islamic religious people of their own faith who were village administrators.  The term  Bengali  is seen as derogatory by many Rohingya as it implies they are illegal immigrants from Bangladesh, although many can trace family in Myanmar for generations. The Myanmar army operation last year was heavily criticised internationally amid reports of civilian killings, rape and arson that a United Nations investigation said probably constituted crimes against humanity. Suu Kyi is blocking the U.N.-mandated probe into the allegations. Aid workers and monitors worry that the latest attacks, across a wider area than October s violence, will spark an even more aggressive army response and trigger communal clashes between Muslims and Buddhist ethnic Rakhines. Nearly 200 people were killed and around 140,000 displaced in communal violence in the state in 2012. In a statement late on Friday, Suu Kyi  strongly condemned   brutal attacks by terrorists on security forces in Rakhine State .  I would like to commend the members of the police and security forces who have acted with great courage in the face of many challenges,  she added. The government said it had evacuated officials, teachers and hundreds of villagers to army bases and main police stations.  Some will be evacuated by helicopters and some will be taken out by the security forces,  a military source based in Rakhine told Reuters. The Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) which instigated the October attacks claimed responsibility for the offensive, presenting it as a defence against the Myanmar army. Myanmar declared ARSA, previously known as Harakah al-Yaqin,  a terrorist organisation in the wake of the attacks. ',\n",

       " 'TORONTO (Reuters) - A U.S.-Canadian couple freed in Pakistan this week, nearly five years after being abducted in Afghanistan, reunited with the husband s family on Saturday, the Associated Press reported. Joshua Boyle and Caitlan Coleman arrived with their three children late on Friday in Toronto, where the husband said one of his children was murdered and his wife had been raped. Citing an email from Boyle, the AP reported the family had  reached the first true  home  that the children have ever known   after they spent most of Friday asking if each subsequent airport was our new house hopefully.  Boyle, a Canadian, and Coleman, an American were kidnapped while backpacking in Afghanistan in 2012 by the Taliban-allied Haqqani network. Pakistani troops rescued the family this week in the northwest of the country, near the Afghan border. The United States has long accused Pakistan of failing to fight the Haqqani network. The couple had three children while in captivity. Boyle opened his Friday media statement by saying he was delayed due to a medical emergency involving one of his children. AP, citing Boyle s email, said his daughter had a cursory medical exam and hospital staff were  enthusiastically insistent that her chances seemed miraculously high based on a quick physical.   Boyle made a brief statement at Toronto s Pearson International Airport late on Friday, calling on the Taliban  to provide my family with the justice we are owed.   God willing, this litany of stupidity will be the epitaph of the Haqqani network,  he said. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A display of U.S. state flags in a tunnel under Washington’s Capitol complex will be replaced because of controversial Confederate symbols on some of the flags, an administrative committee said on Thursday. In its place, in the busy passageway between the Capitol and adjacent office buildings, depictions of commemorative quarters representing the 50 states, the U.S. territories and Washington, D.C., will be installed, said Committee on House Administration Chairwoman Candice Miller. Michigan Republican Representative Miller said in a statement that she decided to replace the display because of the controversy surrounding the Confederate flag, which is widely seen today as a symbol of racism and slavery.  “I am well aware of how many Americans negatively view the Confederate flag, and, personally, I am very sympathetic to these views,” she said. Lawmakers who choose to hang their home states’ flags outside their offices may still do so. “In this way all state flags are displayed on Capitol Hill,” Miller said.   Only the Mississippi state flag still depicts the Confederate battle flag, in the top left corner. Symbols from various Confederate flags are evident in the flags of Alabama, Florida, Georgia and Arkansas. All these states were among those that seceded from the union in 1860-1861 and joined the pro-slavery Confederate States of America that was defeated by the anti-slavery union in the American Civil War. Representative Bennie Thompson, a Mississippi Democrat who pushed last year for his state’s flag to be removed from the Capitol, praised Miller’s announcement as a step toward removing all signs of the “Confederate revolt against our own country.” Criticism over public display of the Confederate flag  intensified last year after a white man who gunned down nine black churchgoers in South Carolina was pictured on social media with it. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a Wisconsin Republican, told a weekly news conference that he supports the decision to change the display. It is expected to be installed once renovations of the tunnel are finished later this year. ',\n",

When the firm discovered their client was a pedophile, they decided that they were not legally obliged to report his off shore business activities to the authorities.Another galling example shown in the video is how one company, with the help of Mossack Fonseca, deprived the nation of Uganda of over $400 million in taxes. In a country as poor as Uganda, this lack of money leads directly to the death of women and children who cannot receive proper healthcare. Remember that when you hear a Republican refuse to investigate the law firm in the coming weeks.Mossack Fonseca is also involved with laundering money for the international drug trade, which is where the millions of dead people mentioned in the title come from.Watch the video below and try to imagine what kind of people can be so callous towards their fellow man: Featured image via screen capture',\n",

Obama s the only president this four-year-old has ever known, but this was the first time she had to face the hard reality of term limits.The video starts off with Abella seeming to cry over whatever four-year-olds cry over. She asked her mother Andrea if she could watch a movie to  make (her) feel better.  Then, Andrea asked what was wrong and Abella cried,  I miss Obama. Andrea explained:  Abella has been an Obama fan since day one. She has grown up with him as a hero in our household, and as such has always talked about how much she loves him. I was just listening to the DNC speeches, and she asked me what they were talking about. So I explained to her that the country is getting ready to elect a new president. She immediately had tears running down her face and explained to me that Barack Obama was our president and how could we get a new one when we already had one.

       " 'PARIS (Reuters) - Fewer French voters are dissatisfied with Emmanuel Macron s performance, a poll showed on Sunday, halting a recent slide in the popularity ratings of the French president in recent months. The poll, conducted by Ifop for newspaper Le Journal du Dimanche (JDD), showed Macron s  dissatisfaction rating  declining to 53 percent in September, from 57 percent in August. Some 45 percent expressed satisfaction with the centrist leader - up from 40 percent in August. The poll of 1,989 people was carried out on Sept. 15-23. Macron s approval ratings have dropped sharply in opinion polls since his election in May, dragged down by labor reforms and planned budget cuts, including a decrease in housing aid for students. The new poll comes as French far-left opposition party leader Jean-Luc Melenchon drew tens of thousands to a rally on Saturday against Macron s labor reforms, aiming to reinforce his credentials as Macron s strongest political opponent.

       " 'Fox News is desperate to sabotage Hillary Clinton s campaign so they are continuing to launch outrageous lies about her health.Last week, Sean Hannity pushed an absurd claim that Hillary suffered a seizure on camera because she playfully acted like a bobble head doll while being pulled in different directions by different speakers. When the joke was over she then spoke and smiled, two things that people definitely do not do while having a seizure.As Newsweek s Kurt Eichenwald explained to Hannity earlier this week, People do not smile during a seizure while standing upright and then immediately launch into a coherent sentence. There s no smiling because, if for some reason the person experiencing the seizure has not collapsed to the ground in unconsciousness, the moment the body begins to move uncontrollably is terrifying. After a seizure, someone does not instantly jump back into a conversation, making jokes. Eichenwald should know. He has epilepsy.But Fox & Friends has picked up where Hannity left off and made a brand new claim on Thursday in an effort to cast doubt on the health of Hillary s mind.Steve Doocy, who was named in Gretchen Carlson s sexual harassment lawsuit against Roger Ailes, suggested that Hillary Clinton has brain damage because she wears prism eyeglasses. Is that the fact that when we saw Hillary Clinton wearing those prism glasses, a sign of brain damage and other things, and he s worried about the care she s getting so far,  Doocy said in reference to Dr. Drew Pinsky allegedly expressing concern for Hillary s health.Kilmeade then suggested that Clinton s glasses are connected to Benghazi, because conservatives will never stop talking about that. And if you want to   or remember, when she was wearing those glasses, remember when she made those famous line to Senator Ron Johnson,  What difference at this point does it make,  that s when she had those glasses on. Here s the video via Media Matters.This kind of speculation is why Fox should drop the  News  part of their name.Just because Hillary Clinton is wearing prism glasses it does not mean that she has brain damage. It means she has eye problems like 75 percent of Americans do.Hillary wears Fresnel prism glasses to correct double vision resulting from a concussion she sustained in 2012 after she fainted and fell due to dehydration.This in no way disqualifies her from being president. She merely has a vision issue that needs correcting.And if wearing glasses is a sign of brain damage perhaps Fox should have performed a quick search on Google for Donald Trump. Because they would have found this.So does that mean Trump has brain damage? I mean, that would definitely explain Trump s crazy behavior over the last year.Featured image via Twitter',\n",
       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump went around and over the  Great Firewall  of China in a late-night tweet in Beijing as he thanked his hosts for a rare tour of the Forbidden City and a private dinner at the sprawling, centuries-old palace complex.  Many Western social media platforms such as Twitter and Facebook are banned in China. A sophisticated system has been built to deny online users within China access to blocked content.  That was not an issue for Trump, known for tweeting to his 42.3 million followers at any hour of the day, on Wednesday, the day he arrived in Beijing.  On behalf of @FLOTUS Melania and I, THANK YOU for an unforgettable afternoon and evening at the Forbidden City in Beijing, President Xi and Madame Peng Liyuan. We are looking forward to rejoining you tomorrow morning!  Trump even changed his Twitter banner, uploading a photograph of himself and Melania with Chinese President Xi Jinping and his wife, Peng Liyuan, during a Chinese opera performance at the Forbidden City.  The Twitter banner upload did not go unnoticed by Chinese state media, with state broadcaster CCTV flashing screenshots of the photograph on Thursday. Trump s visit was also the third-most talked-about topic on Chinese social media platform Weibo over the last 24 hours, trailing only the birthday of a singer in a Chinese boy band and a weekly Asian pop song chart.  Many people wondered how Trump managed to evade China s tough internet controls.   I guess he must have done it via wifi on a satellite network,  said a user on Weibo. Many foreigners log on to virtual private networks (VPNs) to access content hosted outside of China. Another option is to sign up for a data-roaming service before leaving one s home country.   The president will tweet whatever he wants. That s his way of communicating directly with the American people. Why not?  a White House official said ahead of Trump s arrival in Beijing on Wednesday.  When asked whether China considers Trump s use of Twitter to be in breach of Chinese law, Foreign Ministry spokeswoman Hua Chunying said there were many means of communication with  the outside world .   In China, people have many channels to communicate, it s just that they communicate in different ways,  Hua said at a regular ministry briefing.  For example, some people use WeChat, some people use Weibo. Some people use Apple phones, some people use Huawei phones.  Trump tweeted again on Thursday afternoon, posting an ABC News video montage of the  incredible  welcome parade at the Great Hall of the People, where he was greeted by a military band and jumping, flag-waving children.  In his tweet, Trump embedded a link to a photograph of his Beijing visit on Instagram - also forbidden in China.  Not all of Trump s tweets in China were bright and cheerful.   NoKo has interpreted America s past restraint as weakness,  he tweeted about reclusive North Korea s nuclear and missile threats.  This would be a fatal miscalculation. Do not underestimate us. AND DO NOT TRY US.   ',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Dozens of protesters gathered outside of Goldman Sachs Group Inc headquarters on Tuesday to rally against President-elect Donald Trump’s picking several former executives of the Wall Street bank for top jobs in his administration. Some of the 50 or so protesters wore swamp-monster masks in reference to Trump’s pledge to “drain the swamp” that he said Washington has become and get rid of special interests. About 20 of them brought sleeping bags, intending to camp outside 200 West Street until Trump’s inauguration on Friday. Goldman Sachs security guards sent employees and guests to entrances on the north side of the building on the rainy evening as protesters unrolled green sleeping bags on the southwest corner. In an emailed statement, Goldman Sachs spokeswoman Tiffany Galvin said the bank respects “every individual’s rights to assembly and free speech.” She declined to comment on the protesters’ objections to Trump’s nominations of ex-Goldman employees including Steve Mnuchin, Trump’s pick to lead the U.S. Treasury Department. Others include Gary Cohn, who had been chief operating officer before becoming Trump’s economic adviser, and Dina Powell, who left her position as Goldman’s head of philanthropic investing to do the same. Goldman Sachs had long been viewed as Wall Street’s most prestigious and profitable bank with so many executives leaving for high-profile government positions it earned the nickname “Government Sachs.” But in the aftermath of the 2008 financial crisis, Goldman instead found itself blamed by politicians and activists for profiting from the implosion of the mortgage market. In response, the bank embarked on a public relations campaign to clean up its image and launched initiatives to help small businesses, prisoners and female entrepreneurs. But the string of Trump appointments has renewed some of public contempt it received during the Occupy Wall Street protests in 2011. (reut.rs/pJKyQX) Nelini Stamp, 29, an organizer with a group called Working Families, said she also participated in that movement and  Trump’s appointments drove her to come back. “We’re here to make sure that people realize that Goldman Sachs is running our government,” Stamp said. Holding a sign with the image of a swamp monster biting down on a gold bar emblazoned with #GovernmentSachs and “foreclosures,” Ethan Cantor, 25, said it was his first time at a protest. The New Jersey native said Trump’s embrace of Goldman Sachs contradicted criticism the president-elect had leveled against Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton for speaking fees she received from the bank. “He used Goldman as a dig against Hillary,” said Cantor, who said he reluctantly voted for Democratic candidates in the last election. “One good thing about (Trump’s) campaign was that it was populist. Now he’s lying to his own voters.” ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON/BEIJING (Reuters) - Chinese efforts to persuade North Korea to rein in its nuclear program have failed, President Donald Trump said on Tuesday, ratcheting up the rhetoric over the death of an American student who had been detained by Pyongyang. Trump has held high hopes for greater cooperation from China to exert influence over North Korea, leaning heavily on Chinese President Xi Jinping for his assistance. The two leaders had a high-profile summit in Florida in April and Trump has frequently praised Xi while resisting criticizing Chinese trade practices. “While I greatly appreciate the efforts of President Xi & China to help with North Korea, it has not worked out. At least I know China tried!” Trump wrote on Twitter. It was unclear whether his remark represented a significant shift in his thinking in the U.S. struggle to stop North Korea’s nuclear program and its test launching of missiles or a change in U.S. policy toward China. “I think the president is signaling some frustration,” Christopher Hill, a former U.S. ambassador to South Korea, told MSNBC. “He’s signaling to others that he understands this isn’t working, and he’s trying to defend himself, or justify himself, by saying that at least they tried as opposed to others who didn’t even try.” China’s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday that China had made “unremitting efforts” to resolve tensions on the Korean peninsula, and that it had “always played and important and constructive role”. “China’s efforts to resolve the peninsula nuclear issue is not due to any external pressure, but because China is a member of the region and a responsible member of the international community, and because resolving the peninsula nuclear issue is in China’s interests,” ministry spokesman Geng Shuang told a daily news briefing.  On Tuesday, a U.S. official, who did not want to be identified, said U.S. spy satellites had detected movements recently at North Korea’s nuclear test site near a tunnel entrance, but it was unclear if these were preparations for a new nuclear test - perhaps to coincide with high-level talks between the United States and China in Washington on Wednesday. “North Korea remains prepared to conduct a sixth nuclear test at any time when there is an order from leadership but there are no new unusual indications that can be shared,” a South Korean Defense Ministry official said, speaking on the condition of anonymity.  Seoul was in close consultation with Washington over the matter, the official added.     North Korea last tested a nuclear bomb in September, but it has conducted repeated missile test since and vowed to develop a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland, putting it at the forefront of Trump’s security worries. U.S.-CHINA DIALOGUE The Trump statement about China was likely to increase pressure on Beijing ahead of Wednesday’s Diplomatic and Security Dialogue, which will pair U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and Defense Secretary James Mattis with China’s top diplomat, State Councilor Yang Jiechi, and General Fang Fenghui, chief of joint staff of the People’s Liberation Army. The State Department says the dialogue will focus on ways to increase pressure on North Korea, but also cover such areas as counter-terrorism and territorial rivalries in the South China Sea. The U.S. side is expected to press China to cooperate on a further toughening of international sanctions on North Korea. The United States and its allies would like to see an oil embargo and bans on the North Korean airline and guest workers among other moves, steps diplomats say have been resisted by China and Russia. In a sign that U.S.-Chinese relations remain stable, a White House aide said Trump’s daughter Ivanka Trump and her husband, White House senior adviser Jared Kushner, were invited by the Chinese government to visit the country later this year. Trump has hardened his rhetoric against North Korea following the death of Otto Warmbier, a University of Virginia student who died on Monday in the United States after returning from captivity in North Korea in a coma. In a White House meeting with visiting Ukraine President Petro Poroshenko, Trump criticized the way Warmbier’s case was handled in the year since his arrest, appearing to assail both North Korea and his predecessor, President Barack Obama. “What happened to Otto is a disgrace. And I spoke with his family. His family is incredible ... but he should have been brought home a long time ago,” Trump said. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said the United States holds North Korea accountable for Warmbier’s “unjust imprisonment” and urged Pyongyang to release three other Americans who are detained. Chinese state-run newspaper the Global Times, published by the official People’s Daily, said Chinese officials must be wary that Warmbier’s death might push Washington to put greater pressure on Beijing. “China has made the utmost efforts to help break the stalemate in the North Korean nuclear issue. But by no means will China, nor will Chinese society permit it to, act as a ‘U.S. ally’ in pressuring North Korea,” the Global Times said in an editorial. If Washington imposes sanctions on Chinese enterprises, it would lead to “grave friction” between the two countries, said the paper, which does not represent Chinese government policy. Trump’s tweet about China took some advisers by surprise. A senior administration official, speaking on condition of anonymity, said the United States had limited options to rein in North Korea without Chinese assistance. White House spokesman Sean Spicer said a meeting between Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un is less likely following Warmbier’s death. Spicer said Trump would be willing to meet Kim under the right conditions, but “clearly we’re moving further away, not closer to those conditions.” For graphic on Americans detained by North Korea, click: tmsnrt.rs/2r5xYpB ',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump s latest executive orders are being protested against and shredded for their xenophobic, hateful nature   and the Republicans who didn t have the backbone to stand up to him are getting equally pummeled.Among the biggest moronic minion who didn t have the balls to stand up to tyrant Trump is House Speaker Paul Ryan, who got absolutely decimated on Wikipedia recently. In reference to his complete lack of spine, a Wikipedia page listed him under invertebrates, joining the ranks of creatures like worms. Truly, there has never been a better way to describe Ryan and similar GOPers   until now.This edit to the invertebrate Wikipedia page was first spotted by BuzzFeed s Alp Ozcelik, and it is SO perfect:According to the Wikipedia page, invertebrates are characterized like this: The trait that is common to all invertebrates is the absence of a vertebral column (backbone): this creates a distinction between invertebrates and vertebrates. The distinction is one of convenience only; it is not based on any clear biologically homologous trait, any more than the common trait of having wings functionally unites insects, bats, and birds, or than not having wings unites tortoises, snails and sponges. Being animals, invertebrates are heterotrophs, and require sustenance in the form of the consumption of other organisms. With a few exceptions, such as the Porifera, invertebrates generally have bodies composed of differentiated tissues. There is also typically a digestive chamber with one or two openings to the exterior. We couldn t have said it better ourselves. Ryan s behavior when it comes to Trump has been extremely disappointing, and he has become more of a pushover since Trump officially became POTUS. Proving that he doesn t have the guts or spine to stand by his previous statements, Ryan quietly allowed Trump to go ahead with his Muslim ban this week, despite the fact that he felt VERY differently in July:To compare, this is what Ryan said after Trump signed his disastrous executive order this week: Our number one responsibility is to protect the homeland. We are a compassionate nation, and I support the refugee resettlement program, but it s time to reevaluate and strengthen the visa vetting process. This is why we passed bipartisan legislation in the wake of the Paris attacks to pause the intake of refugees. President Trump is right to make sure we are doing everything possible to know exactly who is entering our country. It is absolutely disgusting to have people like this in power. Fortunately, the internet came to our rescue to provide some much needed humor during a time when doom seems eminent. At least someone still dares to tell the truth   even if they re just anonymously editing a Wikipedia page. We truly hope they will do it again!Featured image via Alex Wong / Getty Images',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s eldest son told Senate investigators on Thursday that he had set up a June 2016 meeting with a Russian lawyer because she might have had damaging information about Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton. Donald Trump Jr., in a prepared statement to Senate Judiciary Committee investigators for a meeting behind closed doors, said it was important to learn about Clinton’s “fitness” to be president. “To the extent they had information concerning the fitness, character or qualifications of a presidential candidate, I believed that I should at least hear them out,” said the statement, which was seen by Reuters. Trump also said the meeting with Russian lawyer Natalia Veselnitskaya and others in Trump Tower in New York provided no meaningful information. The New York Times first reported the statement.     Russia has loomed large over the Trump presidency. U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded Moscow worked to tilt the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor. Several congressional committees and a special counsel are also investigating allegations of possible collusion between the Trump campaign and Moscow. The younger Trump’s testimony is believed to be the first by a member of the president’s family to congressional investigators, much of whose work has been conducted behind closed doors. Moscow denies meddling and Trump denies collusion by his campaign, while regularly denouncing the investigations as political witchhunts. When news of the meeting with the lawyer broke earlier this year, the younger Trump at first said that the main topic at the encounter was child adoption from Russia but then he released emails that showed his reason for attending the meeting was to receive possibly damaging information about Clinton.  His statement on Thursday is further acknowledgment that he was willing to receive potential help from a Russian citizen to help his father’s campaign, when it was still not certain he was going to be the Republican presidential nominee. “The fact that Trump Jr. acknowledges taking the meeting along with two other top campaign officials ... during a time in which the nomination was to be contested at the convention, also highlights how significant the campaign viewed the promise of dirt on their opponent from the Russian government,” Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, said in a statement. Trump’s son-in-law Jared Kushner, now a senior White House adviser, and former campaign chairman Paul Manafort also attended the Trump Tower meeting. Congressional investigators have focused on the June 9, 2016, meeting, and what came of it, if anything, in terms of the relationship between Russians and the Trump campaign or Trump business interests. “As will become clear, I did not collude with any foreign government and do not know of anyone who did,” the statement said, promising to “set forth the sum and substance” of what happened at that meeting. Trump Jr. was questioned by Judiciary Committee staff for five hours. He left without speaking to reporters, and the meeting room entrance was shielded by a special partition that kept news cameras from recording his arrival and departure.  A handful of mostly Democratic senators attended the meeting but said questioning was limited to staff. The session was not classified and Trump Jr. was not under oath. However, it is illegal to provide false information to Congress. Democratic Senator Richard Blumenthal described the atmosphere in the room as “cordial.” He said the testimony made it clear there was more to discover.  “There certainly are a lot of areas that are opening for future witnesses, and questioning,” he told reporters.     Blumenthal also said he expected Trump Jr. would testify under oath later at a public Judiciary Committee hearing.  Schiff said his panel looked forward to having many questions  answered when he appeared before them. ',\n",
       " 'Superstar actress and international humanitarian Angelina Jolie spoke out about Donald Trump s hateful speech that is the central premise of his entire presidential campaign. Speaking at an event in London organized by the BBC about the ongoing Syrian migration crisis, Jolie was asked to respond to Trump s comments on Muslims.Trump has said that if elected president he would enact a ban on Muslim migration to the United States and would also consider a program to track Muslims within the country.The very idea repulsed Jolie:https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_juLMpLPORw To me, America is built on people from around the world coming together for freedoms, especially freedom of religion. So it s hard to hear this is coming from someone who is pressing to be an American president. Jolie has served for several years as Special Envoy for the United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees. Unlike a lot of celebrities who just talk about global issues, she has actually gone to inhospitable areas including war zones, using the intense media spotlight on her to get coverage of humanitarian and social crises.She recently visited Syrian families currently settled in Lebanon, and asked world leaders to step up and do more to help these people who are innocent victims of the ongoing Syrian civil war.When President Obama announced that the United States would pursue strategies to admit more refugees, several Republican leaders panicked. Some in Congress sought to pass legislation barring refugees while some Republican governors announced that they would not allow refugees into their states   but it isn t up to them, and they actually don t have any legal recourse to block refugees from coming in to America.Jolie also addressed this unwarranted fear at her event today as well, noting: Fear of uncontrolled migration has eroded public confidence and the ability of governments and international institutions to control the situation. It has given space to a false air of legitimacy to those who promote politics of fear and separation. Featured image via Twitter',\n",

It s almost as if they re not really grateful for the generosity of the taxpayers who are funding their existence African and Middle-Eastern migrants in an Italian town are protesting insufficient Wi-Fi at their settlement by dumping their garbage into the streets.According to The Local, which cites the Italian-language La Repubblica, a group of two dozen Sub-Saharan African migrants in the town of Ceranova are outraged that a lack of free Wi-Fi at the villa they live in is preventing them from using Skype to communicate with family members back in Africa.The protesters are also angry that the villa doesn t have a professional cleaner to keep things tidy.At first, the protest took the form of migrants marching in the streets and blocking traffic, but now things have escalated and the migrants have begun dumping their trash into the streets to make their point. The stunt led to a confrontation between townsfolk and the migrants, which may have become violent if not for the intervention of the local mayor along with three police officers. Afterwards, a 24-year-old migrant who led the demonstration was kicked out of the refugee facility.The migrants have been living in Ceranova, a small town of about 1,000 people located about 15 miles south of Milan, since July. They are just a small portion of over 120,000 migrants who have arrived in Italy this year, mostly by boat from Africa.At least one Italian is sympathetic to their demands. Obviously it s very important for refugees to have access to the Internet and not just so they can stay in touch with their families,  refugee center manager Barbara Spezzi told The Local.  The Internet helps refugees keep up to date with what s going on at home and in Italy which helps them integrate into Italian life. It s also a great learning tool too: we had a case of a girl who was following her university lectures on YouTube. The stunt has become fodder for Italian politics, with members of the regionalist, anti-immigration Northern League party using it to bolster their arguments against generous refugee policies. They wan t someone to clean their homes   can you believe it?  said party leader Matteo Salvani. He joked that Laura Boldrini, a socialist and president of the Chamber of Deputies (Italy s parliament), should be sent to do the cleaning.There have been assorted cases of migrants reacting badly to their conditions or to the actions of European authorities. Last week, for instance, Eritrean migrants on the Italian island of Lampedusa (a hub for migrants arriving from Africa) marched in protest against requirements that they be fingerprinted before being allowed to leave the island. Some have apparently even launched a hunger strike against the requirement.Via: Daily Caller ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Federal investigators have secured a warrant to examine newly discovered emails related to Hillary Clinton’s private server, a source familiar with the matter said on Sunday, as a prominent Democrat accused FBI Director James Comey of breaking the law by trying to influence the election. The warrant will allow the Federal Bureau of Investigation to examine the emails to see if they are relevant to its probe of the private email server used for government work by Clinton, the Democratic presidential nominee, while she was secretary of state from 2009 to 2013. Comey came under heavy pressure from Democrats on Sunday to quickly provide details of the emails, as Clinton allies worried the prolonged controversy could extend beyond the Nov. 8 election and cast a shadow over a Clinton transition if she wins the White House. Comey’s disclosure of the email discovery in a letter to Congress on Friday plunged the final days of the White House race between Clinton and Republican Donald Trump into turmoil. Clinton had opened a recent lead over Trump in national polls, but it had been narrowing even before the email controversy resurfaced. The unexpected turn in the email controversy shook  financial markets’ conviction of a Clinton victory in the election and the U.S. dollar slipped against major currencies in early Asian trading on Monday. U.S. Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid sent a letter to Comey on Sunday suggesting he violated the Hatch Act, which bars the use of a federal government position to influence an election. “Through your partisan actions, you may have broken the law,” Reid, a senator from Nevada, said in the letter to Comey. Clinton campaign chairman John Podesta and campaign manager Robby Mook questioned Comey’s decision to send a letter notifying Congress of the email review before he even knew whether they were significant or relevant. Comey’s letter was “long on innuendo, short on facts,” Podesta said on CNN’s “State of the Union” program, and accused the FBI chief of breaking precedent by disclosing aspects of an investigation so close to the election. “We are calling on Mr. Comey to come forward and explain what’s at issue here,” Podesta said, adding the significance of the emails was unclear. “He might have taken the first step of actually having looked at them before he did this in the middle of a presidential campaign, so close to the voting,” Podesta said. Comey’s letter was sent over the objections of Justice Department officials. But those officials did not try to stop the FBI from getting the warrant, a source familiar with the decision said, because they are interested in the FBI moving quickly on the probe. Sources close to the investigation have said the latest emails were discovered as part of a separate probe of former Democratic U.S. Representative Anthony Weiner, the estranged husband of Clinton aide Huma Abedin. Weiner is the target of an FBI investigation into illicit text messages he is alleged to have sent to a 15-year-old girl in North Carolina. The FBI already had a warrant to search Weiner’s laptop in that probe, but needed a warrant to look at the material that might be related to Clinton. Sources familiar with the matter said FBI agents working on the Weiner investigation saw material on a laptop belonging to Weiner that led them to believe it might be relevant to the investigation of Clinton’s email practices. Trump has highlighted the issue as proof for his argument that Clinton is corrupt and untrustworthy. “We have one ultimate check on Hillary’s corruption and that is the power of the vote,” Trump told a rally in Las Vegas on Sunday. “The only way to beat the corruption is to show up and vote by the tens of millions.” Comey, who announced in July that the FBI’s long investigation of Clinton’s emails was ending without any charges, said in his letter the agency would review the newly surfaced emails to determine their relevance to the investigation of her handling of classified information. Richard Painter, a professor at the University of Minnesota Law School and the chief White House ethics lawyer from 2005 to 2007, said he filed a complaint over Comey’s actions with the Office of Special Counsel, which investigates Hatch Act violations. “We cannot allow F.B.I. or Justice Department officials to unnecessarily publicize pending investigations concerning candidates of either party while an election is underway. That is an abuse of power,” he said in a column in the New York Times. But Daniel Richman, a former federal prosecutor who now teaches at Columbia Law School, called the allegations that Comey improperly tried to influence the election “inane.” “Comey’s critics cannot show his letter violated the Hatch Act unless they can prove that the FBI director was intending to influence the election rather than inform Congress, which was Comey’s stated aim,” said Richman, who said he had advised Comey on law enforcement policy but not this issue. An ABC News/Washington Post poll released on Sunday showed Clinton with a statistically insignificant 1-point national lead on Trump. About a third of likely voters in the poll said they were less likely to back Clinton given Comey’s disclosure. Clinton, who told a Florida rally on Saturday that Comey’s letter was “deeply troubling,” did not address the issue directly on Sunday but referred vaguely to voters overcoming a “distraction.” “There’s a lot of noise and distraction but it really comes down to the kind of future we want and who can get us there,” she told a packed gay nightclub in Wilton Manors, Florida, where hundreds of supporters who could not get in lined the streets outside. “We don’t want a president who would appoint Supreme Court justices to overturn marriage equality,” she said.

       " 'KOKOMO, Indiana (Reuters) - The lettering is crude, scrawled in black spray paint on the sidewalk in front of Karen Peters’ neatly kept home in the quiet, working class neighborhood where she’s lived most of her life. But the contempt is clear. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0“KKK Bitch.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The racially charged graffiti appeared in mid-October on cars, homes and telephone poles in the small city of Kokomo, Indiana. Many victims, like Peters, were African American, though some were not. Many also had lawn signs for Democratic candidates\\xa0in\\xa0this week’s presidential election, and the signs at several homes were painted over with the Ku Klux Klan’s notorious initials. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “I think it’s a political thing; it’s getting out of hand,” said\\xa0Peters, who believes the heated tenor of the presidential campaign – and especially the aggressive, nativist rhetoric of Republican candidate Donald Trump – has emboldened extremists. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0“When you have (candidates) saying ignorant things, maybe other people think it’s ok to do this stuff, and that’s pretty doggone sad ... It seems like our country is going backwards.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Police have no suspects in the attacks. Democrats, including the mayor and local party officials, believe they were politically motivated. Local Republicans are skeptical, suggesting the damage is the work of ignorant hooligans with no place in the party.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Across the United States, the inflammatory and confrontational tone of political rhetoric is creeping into public discourse and polarizing the electorate. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0It’s hard to quantify the impact; there is no national data that tracks politically motivated crimes\\xa0or incendiary speech.  However, the percentage of voters who believe insulting political opponents is “sometimes fair game” has climbed over the campaign season, from 30 percent in March to 43 percent in October, according to surveys by the non-partisan Pew Research Center. A majority of voters for both parties have “very unfavorable” views of the other party – a first since Pew began asking the question in 1992 – and trust in government is hovering near all-time lows. “These indicators reflect inter-group tensions that can translate into everything from coarse discourse or low levels of aggression all the way up to extremist acts,” said Brian Levin, director of the Center for the Study of Hate and Extremism at California State University.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 While much of the venom has been aimed at immigrants, African Americans and other groups typically aligned with Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton, Republicans also have faced vitriol and hostility. Much of the debate over extremism has focused on the so-called Alt-Right, a loose-knit movement of white nationalists, anti-Semites and immigration foes that has emerged from the political shadows to align itself with the Trump campaign.\\xa0 \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Trump’s vows to build a wall on the Mexican border, deport millions of illegal immigrants and scrutinize Muslims for ties to terrorism have energized the Alt-Right community.  Such rhetoric has helped legitimize the Alt-Right’s concerns about an erosion of the country’s white, Christian majority, said Michael Hill, a self-described white supremacist, anti-Semite and xenophobe who heads the League of the South, a “Southern Nationalist” group dedicated to creating an independent “white man’s land.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0“The general political climate that sort of surrounds his campaign has been very fruitful, not only for us, but for other right-wing groups,” Hill said. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Similar\\xa0nationalist\\xa0undercurrents have stirred other countries, from Russia to Japan to Britain. Last summer, as Britain’s debate over leaving the European Union reached a fever pitch, Jo Cox, a pro-EU lawmaker, was shot and stabbed in the street. Murder suspect Thomas Mair proclaimed “death to traitors, freedom for Britain.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In the United States, reports of hostile political displays, vandalism and violence are cropping up regularly.  In Mississippi, a black church was burned and painted with “Vote Trump.” In North Carolina, a county Republican office was set ablaze last month and a nearby building spray painted with “Nazi Republicans leave town.” In Ohio, a truck load of manure was dumped at a Democratic campaign office. In Utah, a man displaying Trump yard signs found KKK graffiti on his car. In Wisconsin, a fan at a college football game wore a President Barack Obama mask with a noose on his neck.  Neither the Trump nor the Clinton campaigns responded to requests for comment. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Trump’s positions are consistent with the Alt-Right goal of “slowing the dispossession of whites,” said Jared Taylor, a white nationalist whose website, American Renaissance, is a movement favorite. But the media is over-hyping his support within the Alt-Right “in an attempt to discredit him,” Taylor added. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Trump has been criticized by both Democrats and some Republicans for being slow to condemn the more extreme elements of the political right. But when a leading KKK newspaper ran a pro-Trump story on its front page last week, his campaign immediately issued a statement rejecting the “repulsive” article. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Taylor, Hill and other Alt-Right figures say they don’t advocate or condone vandalism or violence. They dismiss the notion that their rhetoric constitutes hate speech, arguing that their vilification by the left is far more hateful. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Left-wing extremists do have a history of aggressive confrontation with people or groups seen as fascist or racist, says Heidi Beirich, of the Southern Poverty Law Center, an organization that monitors extremist movements. “There’s usually more violence from the anti-racists than the racists,” she said. The free speech provisions of the U.S. Constitution’s First Amendment grant broad protections for inflammatory rhetoric. But state and federal statutes do give law enforcement agencies authority to investigate and prosecute “hate crimes” motivated by bias against a race, ethnicity, religion, disability or sexual orientation. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0A 6 percent increase in hate crimes documented last year by the California State University researchers showed relatively little underlying change in attacks against most minority groups. But crimes against Muslims rose 86 percent. Some who study and work in the political arena believe there has been a general erosion in civility that began long before the start of the current presidential race. Craig Dunn, Republican party chairman for Howard County, Indiana, which includes Kokomo, says that a minority of extreme voices are being amplified over the Internet and social media, fueling “a general breakdown in civility.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Local officials worry about how their community is being affected. “The atmosphere is “more volatile, there’s more tension,” said\\xa0Kokomo Mayor Greg Goodnight, a Democrat. The graffiti attacks were deeply troubling, he adds. “I don’t remember anything like this ever happening here.” Monica Fowler, 43, who had “KKK” sprayed on her Democratic yard signs, is struggling with the attacks. “It’s okay to disagree,” she says. “But if what you’re doing is going to scare or harm another person, how dare you.” (This story corrects in the ninth paragraph to state that trust, not distrust, in government is near all-time lows Note: paragraph 2 contains language that may offend some readers) ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON/NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Barack Obama on Wednesday appointed a seven-member board to oversee a financial restructuring for Puerto Rico, a majority Republican panel that some market analysts saw as favorable for bondholders of the U.S. territory, which has been crippled by a $70 billion debt crisis. Among the board members, who Obama appointed on the recommendation of legislative leaders, are Arthur Gonzalez, a Democrat and a retired bankruptcy judge who oversaw the Chapter 11 cases of Chrysler and Enron, and Carlos Garcia, a Republican and the former head of Puerto Rico’s Government Development Bank who now runs private equity firm BayBoston. The other appointees are Republicans Andrew Biggs, David Skeel and Jose Carrion III, and Democrats Jose Ramon Gonzalez and Ana Matosantos. The idea of a fiscal control board, known colloquially as La Junta in Puerto Rico, is largely reviled on the island, which has a 45 percent poverty rate and whose chronic economic slump has helped spur rampant outmigration. Among the messages by protesters and graffiti artists plastered around San Juan are: “Wake up! They’re selling our homeland!” and “Say no to oppression.”  But from a market perspective the board figures to be a positive for creditors of the island, said David Tawil, president of hedge fund Maglan Capital. He particularly cited Garcia, calling him “an investor guy, very intertwined with everything that has happened up until now.” And the Democrats on the panel are more moderate than expected, Height Securities analyst Daniel Hanson said in note. Jose Gonzalez, president and chief executive officer of the Federal Home Loan Bank of New York, may be the “key swing vote” for creditor-friendly policies, Hanson said. Keefe Bruyette & Woods analyst Chas Tyson, in a note last week, listed Jose Gonzalez, a former Santander executive, as a potential creditor ally because of his “significant experience in Puerto Rico’s banking sector.” The board was created under the federal law known as PROMESA, passed earlier this year, which will bring Puerto Rico’s finances under federal oversight and give it the authority to restructure some of its debt. The board will be tasked with assessing and certifying annual budgets and a fiscal recovery plan presented by the island’s government, as well as facilitating debt restructuring talks on the island, possibly through a bankruptcy-like process. One interesting pick is Skeel, a professor at the University of Pennsylvania Law School. Though Republicans are generally seen as creditor-friendly, Skeel, a restructuring industry veteran, has repeatedly called for a broad-based restructuring in Puerto Rico.  But he has also stressed that creditor rights should be protected in such a scenario, possibly a good sign for the fate of Puerto Rico’s general obligation debt. That debt is viewed as sacrosanct in municipal debt markets, but it has no legal security under bankruptcy law, which has given some GO holders reason to fret. Importantly, much of the negotiation tactics may be driven by the team of lawyers and financial advisers the board will ultimately select to represent it.      Restructuring consultant Martha Kopacz, of Phoenix Management Services, and veteran bankruptcy lawyer Richard Levin, of Jenner & Block, are among the professionals said to be lobbying to represent the board, according to people familiar with the situation.  House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, both Republicans, each chose two members of the board, while House and Senate Minority Leaders Nancy Pelosi and Harry Reid, Democrats, made one pick apiece. Obama chose the seventh member. ',\n",
       " '21st Century Wire says You know that western society is approaching its final hour when animal rights activists start advocating individual animals to be able to sue humans in courts. That s exactly what has happened in the US.We can trace some of this line of thinking back to Cass Sunstein, the radical, liberal progressive technocrat and chief advisor to President Barack Obama (as well as the husband of disastrous UN Ambassador Samantha Power). According to his own writing and public declarations, Sunstein believes that activists should be able to bring a lawsuit on behalf of an animal in US courts. In his 2004 book Animal Rights: Current Debates and New Directions, Sunstein remarked:Cass Sunstein. My simplest suggestion is that private citizens should be given the right to bring suits to prevent animals from being treated in a way that violates current law. I offer a recommendation that is theoretically modest but that should do a lot of practical good: laws designed to protect animals against cruelty and abuse should be amended and interpreted to give a private cause of action against those who violate them, so as to allow private people to supplement the efforts of public prosecutors. Somewhat more broadly, I will suggest that animals should be permitted to bring suit, with human beings as their representatives, to prevent violations of current law. As one of liberal America s most influential technocrats, Sunstein argues that this legal right can be invoked on the basis of animal cruelty. While no cruelty seems to be present in the case of the Monkey Selfie (see story below), activists at PETA were no doubt emboldened by Sunstein and others who have propelled their ideological argument into the political activist discourse.While our society and our legal system are far from perfect, a move like this from a wealthy charity like PETA could throw that system into even further chaos.Surely, if animals can sue humans, then shouldn t humans be able to sue animals? As you can see, when you pursue this activist rabbit hole, reality starts to dissolve rather quickly.More on this incredible story from AP Monkey Selfie    Copyright credited to David J.

       " 'CHICAGO (Reuters) - A prominent Illinois Republican has resigned from the state legislature, citing multiple incidents of fake Facebook and Twitter accounts set up in his name in recent weeks.  “After some cyber security issues arose, I began to re-evaluate my continued public service,” Representative Ron Sandack, House Republican floor leader, said in a resignation letter dated Sunday and provided on Monday by the Republican Caucus. Sandack, known as an adamant defender of Republican Governor Bruce Rauner’s initiatives on the floor of the Democratic-dominated House, was up for re-election in November against Democrat Greg Hose. His resignation comes as both major U.S. political parties are increasingly bedeviled by hacking, including Friday’s leak of emails that have embarrassed Democrats as they gather for the party’s convention in Philadelphia this week. Sandack had been battling since July 4 to remove multiple fake Facebook and Twitter accounts in his name, he told Capitol Fax, a respected political blog based in Springfield, the state capital. It is not clear what, if anything, the fake accounts posted in his name. Sandack, who was an active user of social media, has shut down his Facebook and Twitter accounts and has filed a police report regarding the fake ones, Capitol Fax reported. A spokeswoman for Jim Durkin, leader of the House Republicans, did not respond to a question on who would replace Sandack as Republican candidate for his seat. Rauner did not respond to reporters’ questions about Sandack following an event on Monday morning.  Sandack is a Chicago lawyer and former mayor of Downers Grove, Illinois. He was appointed in 2010 to the Illinois Senate to fill in for a senator who resigned, and went on to be elected as representative for his suburban Chicago district. In his resignation notice he also said he was no longer willing to miss so many family events. ',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - Rogue Twitter feeds voicing employee concerns at more than a dozen U.S. government agencies have been launched in defiance of what they say are President Donald Trump’s attempts to muzzle federal climate change research and other science. Representing scientists at the Environmental Protection Agency, NASA and other bureaus, either directly or through friends and supporters, the accounts protest restrictions they view as censorship since Trump took office on Jan. 20. Seizing on Trump’s favorite mode of discourse, the feeds reflect concern that the new president, a climate change skeptic, is out to squelch federally backed research showing that emissions from fossil fuel combustion and other human activities are contributing to global warming. “Can’t wait for President Trump to call us FAKE NEWS,” read one posting on the newly opened Twitter account @AltNatParkService. “You can take our official twitter, but you’ll never take our free time!” Reuters could not verify that all the accounts, which borrow the names and logos of their respective agencies, were being run by current federal employees of those agencies. The alternate National Park Service Twitter feed said it had passed control of its account to individuals outside the government to protect colleagues at the agency.  The introductory disclaimer borne by the @RogueNASA account was typical of many of the feeds, describing it as “The unofficial ‘Resistance’ team of NASA. Not an official NASA account.” It beckoned readers to follow its feed “for science and climate news and facts. REAL NEWS, REAL FACTS.” An administrator of an associated Rogue NASA Facebook page told Reuters the alternative site was being used as a platform by agency scientists and others who support them. In some instances, the alternate Twitter accounts were registered on behalf of employees by supporters, presumably to better safeguard their anonymity, as was the case for the unofficial Rocky Mountain National Park site. An individual contacted at the alternative Twitter feed for Mount Rainier National Park said: “It’s not about the people running the accounts. It’s about the movement it’s generated. We may never disclose our identity due to the current political ecosystem.” The swift proliferation of such sites followed internal directives several agencies involved in environmental issues have received since Trump’s inauguration requiring them to curb their dissemination of information to the public.     Last week, Interior Department staff were told to stop posting on Twitter after an employee re-tweeted posts about relatively low attendance at Trump’s swearing-in, and about how material on climate change and civil rights had disappeared from the official White House website. Employees at the EPA and the departments of Interior, Agriculture and Health and Human Services have since confirmed seeing notices from the new administration either instructing them to remove web pages or limit how they communicate to the public, including through social media. The resistance movement gained steam on Tuesday when a series of climate change-related tweets were posted to the official Twitter account of Badlands National Park in South Dakota, administered under the Interior Department, but were soon deleted. A Park Service official later said those tweets came from a former employee no longer authorized to use the official account and that the agency was being encouraged to use Twitter to post public safety and park information only, and to avoid national policy issues. Within hours, unofficial resistance, or rogue, Twitter accounts began sprouting up, emblazoned with the logos of government agencies, the list growing to at least 14 such sites by Wednesday afternoon. An account dubbed @ungaggedEPA invited followers to visit its feeds of “ungagged news, links, tips and conversation that the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency is unable to tell you,” adding that it was “Not directly affiliated with @EPA.” “Civil servants have a job to do and part of that job is to interpret the national parks and history behind it,” said a former official at the Interior Department, the parent agency of the National Park Service, who spoke on condition of anonymity. The former official said that while people outside the federal government could be involved in the rogue accounts, employees with whom the official communicated were supporting the feeds. “They bristle at any political involvement,” the former official said. “They’re taking that as an attack on their work. You have 75l,000 people feeling attacked. You’re going to play whack-a-mole trying to stop them. I don’t see this stopping.” The phenomenon was not limited to U.S. environmental and natural resource employees. They were soon joined by similar alternative Twitter accounts for various science and health agencies, including the Food and Drug Administration, the National Institutes of Health, the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention and the National Weather Service. Many of their messages carried Twitter hashtags #resist or #resistance. ',\n",
       " 'MADRID (Reuters) - Dinner at the Barcelona home of Catalonia-born Montserrat Armisen, an independence supporter, can be a tense affair.   He criticizes us and doesn t let us eat in peace,  said Armisen of her husband, Gustavo Gomez, a Colombian who favors keeping the Spanish state intact, and their children, Jordi, 18, and Nicolas, 27.  We go to our protests, return and don t say anything, but he just carries on,  said Armisen, 55.  It bothers us because there is no respect for us from his part.   For many in Spain, the Catalonia crisis that threatens to fracture the country is also tearing at ordinary families and evoking painful memories of Spain s 1936-39 civil war.  The prospect that Catalonia, a former principality which prides itself on its distinct language and culture, might break away has created divisions across Spanish society, from the kitchen table to the soccer pitch. Many in Spain regard Catalan secessionists as a noisy minority whose national identity is built on a misreading of history, ungrateful to a Spanish state that has underwritten the region s peace and prosperity. In their turn, some secessionists decry unionists as  fascists , harking back to dictator Francisco Franco, who suppressed Catalan language and traditions after his forces won the civil war until his death in 1975. Most Catalans backed the Republican side against Franco.  Small groups of far-right activists have taken part in recent anti-independence protests, with a few giving fascist salutes or carrying the flag of the Falange, the dominant party under Franco. Neo-fascists are disowned by the vast majority of those who want to keep Spain intact but their appearance in public shows how the Catalonia crisis has reopened some of Spain s deepest and most painful wounds.  If I say things I am called a fascist,  said Armisen s husband, Gomez, 58, who has lived in Barcelona with his family for a decade.  Telling them they should not be independent is not being a fascist. Everything that has been done, in my view, is completely illegal,  he told Reuters Television, adding that his wife had even asked him to leave home - something she denies.  What am I doing here?  Gomez asked, holding back tears. Catalan leader Carles Puigdemont had pledged to proclaim the region s independence from Spain after Catalans defied a ban and police crackdown and, according to his government s count, voted overwhelmingly to break away in an Oct. 1 referendum. But, in a speech to the Catalan regional parliament on Tuesday, Puigdemont stepped back from a formal declaration of independence, claiming a mandate to launch secession but saying he would delay doing so to allow time for talks with Madrid on the region s future. Spanish Deputy Prime Minister Soraya Saenz de Santamaria savaged Puigdemont s speech, saying he should come back to the path of the law if he wanted talks with Madrid. She said the Spanish cabinet would meet on Wednesday to discuss its response. On Monday, Pablo Casado, a spokesman for Spain s ruling Popular Party, recalled that 83 years ago, the then Catalan leader, Lluis Companys, was jailed for declaring a Catalan state. He was executed by firing squad in 1940 during Franco s rule. Casado said anyone who declared independence might end up like Companys, in prison. In response, the pro-independence Catalan CUP party said on Twitter:  Thanks for being so Franco, Pablo Casado , using a play on the Spanish word for  frank  and  Franco . The dispute has touched Spain s sacred pastime, soccer. On the day after the referendum, the Spanish national team s Catalan defender, Gerard Pique, an independence supporter, was jeered by fans as he trained with the team. Trade unions are also divided. The Catalan arm of one of Spain s biggest unions, Comisiones Obreras (Workers  Committees), initially backed calls for a general strike in Catalonia on Oct. 3 in response to the police crackdown on the referendum, according to media reports. But at a national level, Comisiones Obreras and another big union, the UGT, later said their Catalan affiliates would not take part in the strike, only protests against the crackdown.  In no case are we going to support positions that give cover to a unilateral declaration of independence,  they said in a joint statement.

       " 'GENEVA (Reuters) - The United States and France called on Russia on Wednesday to deliver the delegation of President Bashar al-Assad to Syria peace talks in Geneva after discussions on ending the six-year war resumed with no sign of the government attending.  The eighth round of negotiations began last week and after a few days with little apparent progress, U.N. mediator Staffan de Mistura said the government delegation, led by Bashar al-Ja afari, was returning to Damascus to  consult and refresh . De Mistura expected talks to resume  around Tuesday  Dec. 5, but Ja afari left Geneva on Saturday and said he might not come back because the opposition had stated that Assad could not play a role in a future interim government. A source close to the Syrian government s negotiating team told Reuters the delegation was still in Damascus on Wednesday.  We have said to the Russians it is important that the Syrian regime be at the table and be part of these negotiations and part of the discussion,  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson told a news conference in Brussels.  We have left it to the Russians to deliver them to table.  A diplomat in Geneva said it was likely, but not confirmed, that the delegation would return to Geneva on Friday. Russia s RIA news agency quoted an unnamed source as saying they would arrive on Sunday or Monday.  Syrian officials have not said if Ja afari will return to the talks but opposition spokesman Yahya al-Aridi said on Monday a government boycott would be  an embarrassment to Russia , which is keen to see a negotiated end to the war. The opposition negotiating team arrived at the U.N. offices in Geneva on Wednesday morning to resume talks with de Mistura, who declined to comment late on Tuesday when asked about the absence of Ja afari s negotiators.  It takes two to Tango, but at the same time you need to talk to the other party,  Aridi told reporters on Wednesday.  If they are quite serious about bringing peace to Syria, well they should show up.  France, a key backer of the Syrian opposition, accused the government of blocking the U.N.-led effort and refusing to engage in good faith to achieve a political solution.  This refusal highlights the obstruction strategy of the political process carried out by the Damascus regime, which is responsible for the absence of progress in the negotiations,  French foreign ministry deputy spokesman Alexandre Georgini told reporters. He also said that Russia, as one of Assad s main supporters, needed to assume its responsibilities so that the Syrian government finally entered the negotiations.  The Russian mission in Geneva did not immediately respond to requests for comment. During last week s sessions, de Mistura shuttled between representatives of the warring sides, who did not meet face-to-face. He had planned to continue the round until Dec. 15.  ',\n",
       " 'What is the price of one s dignity? Florida Senator Marco Rubio recently found himself wrestling with that question and came up with the answer  I d exchange it for nothing, just as long as I get 15 more minutes in the spotlight.  Donald Trump obliged.Having just months ago described Trump as a small dick lunatic con artist (remember how insane the Republican primary was?), Rubio knelt down and kissed the ring this week. On Twitter, he officially endorsed Trump in the most roundabout way possible:In Florida only 2 legitimate candidates on ballot in Nov. I wont vote for Clinton & I after years of asking people to vote I wont abstain.  Marco Rubio (@marcorubio) May 27, 2016Rubio s the kind of spineless politician who won t abstain from voting for Trump, a guy whose rallies he once colorfully described as  a frightening, grotesque, and disturbing development in American politics.  He s voting for that guy.The day before, Rubio said he would give Trump a more ringing endorsement if he let him speak at the Republican National Convention this summer. At one point, Rubio was poised to be the Republican nominee, now he s reduced to begging Trump to let him share the same stage.Apart from the promise of a few  Rubio endorses Trump  headlines, it s baffling to think of why Rubio decided to sell out, and so quickly. The Washington Examiner, a right-wing publication no less, blasted Rubio for his shamelessness.It s one thing to begrudgingly argue that as dangerous as he thinks a Trump presidency would be, that he thinks a Clinton presidency would be even worse. But to actually say that he would be  honored  by the chance to speak on Trump s behalf at the GOP convention, and to downplay his previously stated problems with Trump as mere  policy differences,  is to prove the Rubio skeptics right.That is, far from being an inspirational moral leader, Rubio has shown himself to be more of an opportunistic politician with his finger to the wind.The major problem: Supporting Trump is almost sure to backfire. In the aftermath of the nuclear meltdown coming in November, those closest to Trump are going to be fatally radioactive. In Chernobyl they were referred to as the  walking ghosts,  already doomed but still alive. In November, they ll just be called  Trump s supporters.  Rubio, who is retiring from the Senate at the end of his term (he hardly bothered to work there anyway), is reportedly having second thoughts. He may see throwing himself at the feet of Trump as one way to get his hat back in the ring if he decides to run again.It s a bad miscalculation. Trump may seem popular to the guy who just got absolutely smoked by him in the primary, but the American people still actively loathe Trump. New Jersey Governor Chris Christie learned that lesson the hard way. Already unpopular, a recent poll found that after he announced he would be serving as Trump s campaign jester, a whopping 49 percent of New Jersey voters said they  dislike everything about Gov. Christie.  As polling questions go, that s about the sickest burn imaginable.The internet was quick to reminder Rubio of the fate he just chose for himself.@marcorubio so you\\'ll vote for a guy you called a con artist. A guy you called a lunatic. A guy you called unfit to be president! #sellout  Raj Chudgar (@RajPC1) May 27, 2016Trump tricking Rubio into a Senate loss that would permanently end his career would be the universe\\'s way of making a case that karma exists  LOLGOP (@LOLGOP) May 27, 2016Based on how Rubio has (further) diminished himself in the last 24 hours, maybe Trump\\'s nickname was apt, after all?

       " 'Trump is still beating his  widespread voter fraud  drum, and it hasn t escaped the notice of the Federal Election Commission. Now it seems their frustration has overflowed, because one of the commissioners finally demanded that Trump produce his evidence. Ellen Weintraub, the commissioner in question, issued a formal statement on the matter after Trump told the Senate that thousands of people were bussed from Massachusetts to New Hampshire on Election Day.Apparently those people who were bussed to New Hampshire to vote against him are why he and Kelly Ayotte lost. Weintraub didn t mince words in her statement. She said: The scheme the President of the United States alleges would constitute thousands of felony criminal offenses under New Hampshire law The President has issued an extraordinarily serious and specific charge. Allegations of this magnitude cannot be ignored. She s right   if there really is this kind of voter fraud going on, we need to know. The proper authorities need to know so they can begin investigating and prosecuting those responsible, and so the states can overhaul their election laws to prevent this from happening again.Trump, however, refuses to release his evidence, most likely because he doesn t have any. Knowing President Asterisk, the evidence is people who look like they can t legally vote were voting, and also that he lost that state (and the national popular vote), which just can t possibly have happened.The White House has already made it clear they ll stand behind Trump. Sean Spicer even said: The president does believe [there is widespread fraud]. It s a belief that he s maintained for a while, a concern that he has about voter fraud. And that s based on information that s provided. What information? That s what Weintraub wanted to know when she went on to stick it to Trump on that issue at the end of her statement: I therefore call upon President Trump to immediately share his evidence with the public and with the appropriate law-enforcement authorities so that his allegations may be investigated promptly and thoroughly. That will never happen, because there is no evidence to provide.

       " 'JERUSALEM (Reuters) - A top Israeli diplomat was rebuked by Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Thursday for suggesting that American Jews have a poor commitment to service in the U.S. military. Asked in an English-language television interview about criticism of Israeli policies by some U.S. Jews, Deputy Foreign Minister Tzipi Hotovely questioned whether  people that never send their children to fight for their country  could understand the  complexity  of the Middle east.  Most of the Jews don t have children serving as soldiers, going to the Marines, going to Afghanistan or to Iraq,  she said on i24 TV news on Wednesday.  They don t feel how it feels to be attacked by rockets, and I think part of it is to actually experience what Israel is dealing with on a daily basis,  said Hotovely, a member of Netanyahu s right-wing Likud party. While Israel has often quarreled with American Jews over their right to advise it from afar, Hotovely s remarks went further by appearing to insinuate they are not fully committed to their native country, a notion U.S. Jewish organizations have long fought against in their battle against anti-Semitism. In a statement, Netanyahu, who also serves as Israel s foreign minister, denounced Hotovely s comments as  hurtful .  There is no place for such a harangue and her remarks do not reflect the State of Israel s position,  the statement said. According to a 2009 survey published by the congressionally-mandated Military Leadership Diversity Commission, an estimated 1.09 percent of the members of the U.S. armed forces are Jewish. The Pew Research Center estimated in 2013 that Jews make up about 2 percent of the U.S. adult population.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Trump administration on Friday slammed China on a range of trade issues from its chronic industrial overcapacity to forced technology transfers and longstanding bans on U.S. beef and electronic payment services. The annual trade barriers list from the U.S. Trade Representative’s (USTR) office sets up more areas of potential irritation for the first face-to-face meeting between President Donald Trump and Chinese President Xi Jinping next week in Florida. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross, asked about his expectations for the meeting, told Fox News on Friday: “What I would hope will come out would be a commitment to starting to abide by the rules and a commitment to working collaboratively to help reduce our deficit.“ USTR, controlled by the White House, said that Chinese government industrial policies and financial support for industries such as steel and aluminum have resulted in overproduction and a flood of exports that have distorted global markets and undermined competitors. “While China has begun to take steps to address steel excess capacity, these steps have been inadequate to date and even fewer efforts have been taken by China in aluminum and other sectors,” USTR said in the report. USTR released the list of trade irritants in 63 countries just after senior Trump trade officials announced an executive order to study the causes of U.S. trade deficits.  The report said China also is using a series of cybersecurity restrictions as part of an apparent long-term goal to replace foreign information and communications technology products and services with locally produced versions. USTR also accused China of using a range of measures to engineer the transfer of foreign technology to Chinese firms. They include denying financial or regulatory approvals to companies using foreign-owned intellectual property (IP) or that do not conduct research or manufacture products in China. “China also reportedly conditions foreign investment approvals on technology transfer to Chinese entities, mandates adverse licensing terms on foreign IP licensors, uses anti-monopoly laws to extract technology on unreasonable terms and subsidizes acquisition of foreign high technology firms to bring technology to the Chinese parent companies.” Gaps in IP rights enforcement have allowed the misappropriation of foreign IP and trade secrets, both within and outside of China. USTR’s criticisms are consistent with increasingly vocal concerns raised by international business groups about what they see as a worsening business climate for foreign firms in China, as well as China’s goal to boost domestic manufacturing content in 10 sectors from robotics to biopharmaceuticals. Earlier this month, the European Union Chamber of Commerce said the “Made in China 2025” plan amounts to a “large-scale import substitution plan aimed at nationalizing key industries” or “severely curtailing the position of foreign business.” USTR also brought up longstanding complaints about online piracy of movies, books, music, video games and software in China as well as a ban on U.S. beef that has been in place since 2003. It said delays in China’s approval process for agricultural products derived from biotechnology also worsened in 2016, hurting U.S. corn exports. Ross, the commerce secretary, also said Trump will sign two executive orders on Friday. The first calls for a 90-day study by the Commerce Department into the causes of U.S. trade deficits, the results of which would be used to formulate policy. A second order would solve a problem involving collection of anti-dumping duties, he said. “There’s some $3 billion worth of duties that have never been collected because they set up straw-man importers that don’t have any financial substance, so by the time the case ends, there’s nobody there against whom you can assess the fine. So what these orders will do is require letters of credit or insurance company bonds or cash so there will be somebody against whom we can levy the fine,” Ross said. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Mayors of 21 cities in Florida on Friday called on the moderators of next week’s presidential debates in Miami to ask candidates how they would deal with rising sea levels caused by climate change, a concern of the state’s coastal communities. “It would be\\xa0unconscionable for these issues of grave concern for the people of Florida to not be addressed in the upcoming debate you will be hosting in the state,” the mayors wrote in an letter to CNN, The Washington Post, Univision and the other media outlets hosting the Democratic and Republican debates on March 9 and March 10 in Miami.  The bipartisan group of mayors, who represent coastal cities and towns from Miami to Tampa, have complained that the issue of climate change has not been raised in the dozens of televised debates held to date. Of the four remaining Republican candidates, none say they believe that anything should be done to address climate change and all have called for federal environmental rules to be scaled back. One of the letter’s signatories, Pinecrest Mayor Cindy Lerner, traveled to New Hampshire in February to press Florida Republican candidate Senator Marco Rubio to discuss the issue. Rubio has said that the climate has always been changing and that he will not support policies to combat climate change that will “destroy our economy.” Billionaire businessman Donald Trump has called climate change a conspiracy invented by China, while Texas Senator Ted Cruz called climate science “pseudoscientific theory.” Ohio Governor John Kasich has said climate change is a problem but has not proposed a plan to address it. Democratic hopefuls Hillary Clinton and Senator Bernie Sanders have made climate change a top-tier issue that needs to be addressed. Southeast Florida is especially vulnerable to rising sea levels. Four counties in the region formed the Southeast Florida Regional Climate Change Compact six years ago to coordinate their response and pool funding to deal with its impact. The issue has gotten little attention in the national presidential debates.   The mayors provided debate moderators three questions on climate change, all of which were directed to Rubio. They warned that higher sea levels will pose a costly threat to Florida’s economy. Florida coastal communities could experience about a 2-foot (60-cm) rise in sea level by 2060, the U.S. Geological Survey said.

       " 'The party s over or is it? Hillary Clinton and her aides will need to decide whether to lie or tell the truth to the FBI about her e-mail and official business. This puts them in a position of choosing between being honest about those emails, or lying to the FBI, which is a crime,  said Matthew G. Whitaker, U.S. Attorney for the Southern District of Iowa from 2004 to 2009. He is presently executive director of the Foundation for Accountability and Civic Trust (FACT) in Washington, D.C.Federal agents are preparing to schedule interviews with Clinton s  longtime and closest aides  about her use of the private email and server throughout her tenure as the nation s chief diplomat from 2009 to 2013, the Los Angeles Times reported Monday.Despite Clinton s repeated denial she ever sent or received classified information via her private email, federal investigators said more than 2,000 of the 55,000 pages of emails she turned over to the Department of State did include classified material. More than 20 of those emails contained information so sensitive and classified members of Congress were not allowed to read them.Whitaker s group made public its list of what it judges to be the  top 10 most ethically challenged Hillary emails  March 10, 2016:Nepotism: Clinton intervened Aug. 22, 2012, on behalf of her son-in-law, Marc Mezvinsky, in an effort to secure State Department assistance for one of his business associates with ties to a Clinton Foundation donor. FACT filed a complaint with the U.S. Office of Government Ethics on this issue. Favoring Insiders: Clinton  impressed  billionaire donor George Soros with his easy access to her, according to a May 12, 2012, email to her from Neera Tanden, veteran Clinton adviser and president of the liberal think tank Center for American Progress. Above The Law: Clinton told aide Jake Sullivan in a June 17, 2011, email to disregard classification security regulations and send information for a speech via a non-secure email system, which forced the aide to either break the law or disobey an order. Special Interests: In a July 26, 2010, email exchange with Clinton, Sullivan forwarded a message from Jeffrey Farrow, an influential lobbyist for a Pacific island government. The exchange  raises red flags about whether Farrow had made  requests,  according to FACT. Selling Access: A Dec. 10, 2009, email discussed attempts by Clinton campaign and foundation donor Brian Greenspun to set up a meeting between Clinton and a top Israeli official who had  been trying to meet with [Clinton] to no avail.  The email suggests certain campaign and foundation donors had a privileged  back door  to Clinton. Conflicts Of Interest: Clinton pushed for the State Department to work with the Clinton Foundation and the Red Cross on a project in Haiti. The Jan. 19, 2010, email from Clinton to Chief of Staff Cheryl Mills indicates a clear conflict of interest, according to FACT. Helping Political Allies: Mark Penn, Clinton s 2008 presidential campaign pollster and long-time political adviser, complained about not having timely access on a corporate event in China. His complaints were apparently resolved after a Feb. 22, 2010, email from Clinton aide Kris Balderston that set up a telephone call with Clinton. Trading Favors: Barely a week after the Penn complaint, Balderston reported in a March 2 email to Clinton that major corporations, including Boeing, CITI and Blackstone, agreed to provide financial support for the event.  Even the appearance of this sort of favor trading, involving the public, private and political sectors, is a bad ethics practice,  according to FACT. Abuse Of Position: A Sept. 15, 2011, email forwarded to Clinton, Sullivan and aide Huma Abedin listed multiple State Department officials attending the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative conference despite having  no official role.  Robert Hormats, a department official, was also a speaker at a dinner co-hosted by the Goldman Sachs Wall Street investment firm that later paid Clinton $675,000 for three speeches. The dinner focused on investing in women, Clinton s favorite Clinton Foundation project. Duping Obama: In a Sept. 20, 2011, email to Clinton, Mills forwarded a draft of President Barack Obama s planned remarks to the Clinton Foundation Global Initiative. FACT contends that  Clinton doesn t appear to have routinely received copies of the President s draft speeches, and it sends bad ethical signals to treat a speech given to her family s organization differently.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Wednesday the United States would set up “interim zones of stability” to help refugees return home in the next phase of the fight against Islamic State and al Qaeda in Syria and Iraq. The top U.S. diplomat did not make clear where these zones were to be set up. He was addressing a meeting of 68 countries and organizations gathered in Washington to discuss accelerating the battle against Islamic State. “The United States will increase our pressure on ISIS and al Qaeda and will work to establish interim zones of stability, through ceasefires, to allow refugees to return home,” Tillerson told the gathering at the State Department, where the former oil executive was hosting his first major diplomatic event. Although it was unclear how the zones would work, creating any safe havens could ratchet up U.S. military involvement in Syria and mark a major departure from President Barack Obama’s more cautious approach.  Asked about Tillerson’s remarks, coalition spokesman Colonel Joseph Scrocca said the U.S. military had not yet received direction to establish any kind of “zones”.  Increased U.S. or allied air power would be required if President Donald Trump chooses to enforce ‘no fly’ restrictions, and ground forces might also be needed to protect civilians in those areas. A final statement at the end of the meeting did not mention the possibility of safe zones. Islamic State has been losing ground in both Iraq and Syria, with three separate forces, backed by the United States, Turkey and Russia, advancing on the group’s Syrian stronghold city of Raqqa. U.S. defense officials said on Wednesday the U.S.-led coalition has airlifted Syrian rebel forces in an operation near the Syrian town of Tabqa in Raqqa province.  “I recognize there are many pressing challenges in the Middle East, but defeating ISIS is the United States’ number one goal in the region,” Tillerson said. “As a coalition we are not in the business of nation building or reconstruction,” he said, adding that resources should be focused on preventing the resurgence of ISIS and equipping war-torn communities to rebuild. Wednesday’s event was the first meeting of the coalition since the election of Trump, who has pledged to make the fight against Islamic State a priority.  Tillerson called on coalition partners to make good on financial pledges to secure and rebuild areas where Islamic State has been pushed out. The coalition has pledged more than $2 billion in assistance for Iraq and Syria in 2017. Iraqi government forces, backed by the U.S.-led international coalition, retook several Iraqi cities from Islamic State last year and have liberated eastern Mosul.  While the jihadist group is overwhelmingly outnumbered by Iraqi forces, it has been using suicide car bombs and snipers to defend its remaining strongholds. Speaking to the same meeting, Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi called for unity in the region to combat Islamic State and outlined Iraq’s progress in the fight. He said Iraq was now at the stage of “destroying” Islamic State, not just “containing” it. Recounting a Tuesday conversation with the Iraqi leader, Senator Lindsey Graham said Abadi believed reconstruction of Anbar province as well as Mosul in Nineveh province would cost about $50 billion.

Being a 64-year old woman who is married to a charismatic 39-year old man, who is also the newly elected leader of France is probably not that easy. She likely has a rigorous workout schedule, and if she is like most women, she appreciates it when someone notices how hard she works to stay in  great shape.  It is possible that Macron has simply been gifted with great genes and does nothing at all to stay in  great shape , but either way, a compliment about her appearance was likely appreciated by the 64-year old stunner. The Daily Mail ran a wildly popular article in May about Brigitte Macron titled:How DOES Macron s wife defy her age? Experts claim hair extensions, veneers, designer style and some very subtle cosmetic surgery keep Brigitte Trogneux, 64, looking so youthfulHmmm We don t remember the outrage from the media over the Daily Mail article that explored every possibility that could explain Macron s age-defying look, that ran just prior to France s election. There will, of course, always be critics. After all, the compliment didn t just come from any man, it came from the man who was not supposed to defeat the media s candidate, Hillary Clinton.Many on social media have criticized the Macron couple s difference in age. Macron s campaign was very aware that the age difference could be a turn off to some voters, as the media was quick to dispel any thoughts that Brigitte was some sort of  pedophile  or  cougar.  They shared the Macron s unusual story of how Emmanuel Macron fell in love with his wife Brigitte while she was his high school drama teacher. They talked about how he pledged his love to her early on, promising he would come back some day and marry her. (How quickly everyone forgets the criticism Donald Trump got on social media for marrying the much younger Melania.)In case the world hasn t noticed, President Trump doesn t play the same game as other politicians. He s genuine and honest. He says what he feels and most importantly, he says what s in his heart. He s not a career politician, and for that, most of us are grateful. When President Trump greeted Brigitte Macron for the first time, he shook her hand, looked her straight in the eye, and complimented her on how great she looked. Trump simply told her,  You re in such great shape  and then followed it up by telling her she was  beautiful . The media and those on the left went nuts. It wasn t just individuals on social media and leftist journalists who attacked Donald Trump. One major athletic apparel and accessory company took to Twitter to mock our sitting President.For some reason, someone at Reebok thought it would be a good idea to tweet a chart to President Trump to let him know whether or not he should compliment the 64-year old Macron. When did Reebok become the arbiter of free-speech? Who, at Reebok decided it would be a good idea to mock our President on social media?  Is Reebok really such a powerful athletic wear company that they can afford to lose half of their customer base over a stupid tweet?  In case you were wondering when it IS appropriate to say, \"You\\'re in such good shape beautiful,\"  THIS: pic.twitter.com/Z1cnnRD8Ut  Reebok (@Reebok) July 14, 2017Note to Reebok: We don t care that President Trump offended French liberals and leftist American journalists. We don t care that he offended Democrat lawmakers, who are constantly looking for a reason to discredit our president. We care that President Trump loves America, and that he wakes up every day thinking about how he ll continue to bring more jobs back to Americans. We admire him for his commitment to putting America first and for his dedication to keeping our nation safe. We don t give a damn if you re offended over President Trump s  compliments to Brigitte Macron.The Macron s spent several hours with the Trump s, after President Trump offered his sincere compliments to Brigitte. Many of the photos taken after the first meeting with the Macron s and Trump s defy what the media would like you to believe about Trump s relationship with the French president and his wife. In fact, quite to the contrary, Mr. and Mrs. Macron appeared to be enjoying their visit with America s first couple quite a bit.    ',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - Ted Cruz’s Super Tuesday victories in his home state of Texas and neighboring Oklahoma strengthened his odds for the Republican presidential nomination on online betting sites but he still trails far behind Donald Trump. On PredictIt.com, operated by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, the predicted chances of the Texas senator winning the nomination for the Nov. 8 election rose to 10 percent as results from Super Tuesday voting continued to be tallied. Cruz has gained 4 percentage points in the past two days and his predicted chances stood at the highest level on the site since he tumbled to a record low after a weak showing in the South Carolina primary on Feb 20. But Trump, who rolled to wins in at least seven states on Super Tuesday, was outdistancing both Cruz and his other top rival, U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida. PredictIt had Trump’s odds of winning the nomination at 76 percent early on Wednesday, down 4 points from Monday’s record high of 80 percent. Rubio, who scored his first win in a nominating contest on Tuesday with the Minnesota Republican caucuses, dropped 1 point to 10 percent, a record low for him. Betting volumes on both Trump and Cruz hit records for the candidates on Tuesday and Rubio’s volume was his second highest ever. Other online betting venues also gave Trump, a New York billionaire businessman, the strongest odds of winning the nomination. Ireland’s PaddyPower put Trump as a 1-to-7 favorite, with Rubio following at 5-1 and Cruz at 12-1. Ladbrokes PLC said on Wednesday morning that Trump’s odds of securing the nomination were 1-5. Rubio came in a distant second at 9-2, followed by Cruz at 25-1. Message boards associated with PredictIt featured growing discussion of a possible brokered convention, which can occur when no candidate has won a clear majority of delegates before the start of the party’s nominating convention. There has not been a brokered U.S. major-party convention since 1952 when the Democrats nominated Illinois Governor Adlai Stevenson on the third ballot. “I am betting against Trump getting the nomination at these odds but only because I think there is a 30 percent chance the GOP elite somehow successfully blocks him at the convention,” said a post from a forum member with the username matthewcooley.

       " '(Reuters) - Republican Donald Trump had one last chance at a nationally televised debate to reach out to the undecided voters he badly needs to keep his presidential campaign viable.  He passed on the opportunity. Instead, he chose on Wednesday to stay with the strategy he has employed during recent weeks: Pump up his hard-core supporters and hope that’s enough to win.  He suggested he might not accept the election result if his Democratic opponent Hillary Clinton wins on Nov. 8, called her a “nasty woman,” and repeated hard-line conservative positions on issues such as abortion and immigration.  While that kind of rhetoric was catnip to his passionate, anti-establishment base, it is unlikely to have appealed to independent voters and women who have yet to choose a candidate. “When you’re trailing in the polls, you don’t need a headline the next morning saying that you’re not going to accept the election results,” said Ford O’Connell, a Republican strategist who supports Trump. With less than three weeks left in the race, Trump is behind Clinton in most battleground states and is underperforming in almost every demographic voter group compared to the Republican nominee, Mitt Romney, four years ago. Party strategists had said before the debate that he needed to use the event to draw in voters beyond his hard-core supporters.  Trump didn’t listen or perhaps didn’t care. His debate was a continuation of his apparent strategy to ensure his most fervent supporters show up on Election Day, while betting that his attacks on Clinton’s character and truthfulness will discourage voting by already skeptical young and liberal Democrats. But experts who study voter behavior warned that his attacks on Clinton may backfire, saying he may instead awaken Democratic voters who have so far been uninspired by Clinton. “The risk he faces by engaging in a scorched-earth policy is that he activates people rather than turning them off,” said Michael McDonald, who runs the U.S. Election Project at the University of Florida. McDonald, who tracks early voting returns and absentee ballot requests, said he is seeing larger than expected surges of support for Clinton in southeastern states such as Virginia, North Carolina, and Florida. The Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project, which uses a massive online opinion poll to project election outcomes in all 50 states, estimates that Clinton has a 95 percent chance of winning the election by about 118 votes in the Electoral College if it were held today. It is against this backdrop that Trump has apparently decided to double down on energizing his base rather than broadening it. But the poll results cast doubt on the wisdom of that strategy. If Trump’s core white, male, working class supporters vote at high rates, as expected, that likely won’t be enough to win. Trump, for example, already does well with white men who are at retirement age. Nine out of 10 of them are already expected to vote, according to the polling results, so, there is little room to squeeze out more votes. Voting rights activists have accused Trump of trying to suppress voter turnout by claiming, without evidence, that the election has been rigged against him. He has also said his supporters need to monitor polling stations to ensure a fair vote, which the activists decry as an act of intimidation.  Should Trump’s comments succeed in discouraging some Democratic voters from turning out, that may also not be enough to help him secure the White House. He still loses under what could be considered a dream scenario for the Republican nominee: white men show up in greater numbers than expected, while turnout among racial minorities is lower than expected. In this scenario, the States of the Nation project estimates that Trump would win the battleground states of Ohio and North Carolina, and he would have a shot at winning Pennsylvania, Wisconsin and Colorado. Even then, Clinton would still have an 82 percent chance of winning the election. There’s yet another risk to Trump’s strategy. By claiming the election is rigged, he could be unintentionally signaling to his supporters that voting no longer matters. Michael Sopko, 63, a mortgage broker from Denver and a Trump backer, said before the debate that he sees his vote as pointless. “They have already been corrupted,” he said of voting machines, speaking ahead of a Trump rally in Colorado Springs. “I think the results are already cast.” ',\n",
       " 'ANKARA (Reuters) - The United States is Iran s  number one enemy  and Tehran will never succumb to Washington s pressure over a multinational nuclear deal, Iran s Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said in a televised speech on Thursday. U.S. President Donald Trump broke ranks with other major powers last month by refusing to formally certify Iran s compliance with the nuclear deal. Under that deal, most sanctions on Iran were lifted in exchange for Tehran curbing its nuclear work.  The American president s foolish remarks against our people show the depth of America s hostility towards the entire Iranian nation,  Iran s top authority Khamenei told a group of students.   America is the number one enemy of our nation.   Since the deal was reached in 2015, Khamenei has continued to denounce the United States publicly, suggesting that antagonism between the two countries since the 1979 Islamic revolution in Tehran would not abate because of the accord.  Iran and the United States severed diplomatic ties shortly after the revolution, when hardline students took 52 Americans hostage for 444 days. Iran will mark the anniversary of the American embassy seizure on Saturday.  Trump has called the nuclear agreement, which was reached under his predecessor Barack Obama,  the worst deal ever negotiated  and has adopted a harsh approach to Iran over its nuclear and ballistic missile programs.  Washington has imposed new sanctions on Iran over its missile activity, calling on Tehran not to develop missiles capable of delivering nuclear bombs. Iran says it has no such plans and its missile program is solely for defense purposes. The deal s other signatories, Britain, France, Germany, Russia and China, and the European Union say Washington cannot unilaterally cancel an international accord enshrined by a U.N. resolution. Iranian officials have repeatedly said that Tehran would stick to the nuclear accord as long as the other signatories respected it. But it has warned about the consequences if the deal falls apart.   We will never accept their bullying over the nuclear deal ... Americans are using all the wickedness to damage the result of the nuclear talks,  Khamenei said to chants of  Death to America  by students.   Any retreat by Iran will make America more blatant and impudent ... Resistance is the only option.  Trump also accuses Iran of supporting terrorism in the Middle East. Iran rejects that and in turn blames the growth of militant groups such as Islamic State on the policies of the United States and its regional allies.  Shi ite-dominated Iran and its regional arch-rival, U.S.-backed Sunni Saudi Arabia, are involved in proxy wars across the region, backing opposite sides in Syria, Yemen, Iraq and Lebanon. ',\n",
       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - Britain needs to set out plans to make sure its lawyers can keep working across Europe after Brexit, a lobby group said on Thursday. TheCityUK said Britain s withdrawal from the European Union should also not threaten the international dominance of English law and the prospects of an industry that generated 31.5 billion pounds ($42 billion) in revenue last year. The group, which lobbies for financial and legal services firms, said it was urging the government  to do everything it can to make sure Brexit does not act as a barrier to future growth opportunities but as a stimulant.   This includes the need to secure mutual market access to enable UK-based practitioners to continue to represent clients in EU jurisdictions.  The government needed to give details on how it planned to convert EU rules governing the industry into domestic law, and the process for signing up to international conventions. Legal services make up 1.5 percent of the UK economy and employ more than 311,000 people, TheCityUK said in a report on the industry.  More than 200 foreign law firms have set up shop in London and English law is used in 40 percent of global corporate arbitrations, it added.  The choice of English law for global commercial contracts is in part driven by the UK s reputation as the leading center for international dispute resolution,  the report said.  But others are waiting in the wings. The German Federal State of Hesse promoted a conference earlier this year that looked at how Brexit provided an opportunity for Frankfurt to become a new litigation hub in Europe.

This public meltdown came just a few days after Meet the Press host Chuck Todd had tried to ask Cruz if he would keep his pledge to support the eventual Republican nominee regardless of who it was, and Cruz repeatedly dodged the question.Cruz had been busy insulting the business mogul at a press conference in Evansville, Indiana when NBC News correspondent Hallie Jackson tried to get a straight answer from the Texas senator on whether or not he would back Trump, hoping to get more of an answer than Todd was able to.

       " 'The USPS is drowning in debt, has lost every one of its life-lines and has mismanaged its funds for decades. No worries though, the US Postal Union is quite certain Socialist Santa Claus will fix everything Presidential hopeful Sen. Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.) won the endorsement of the American Postal Workers Union on Thursday, giving the self-described democratic socialist a boost as he seeks more support from organized labor in the Democratic primary.APWU represents 200,000 U.S. Postal Service employees and retirees. It s the second major national union and member of the AFL-CIO labor federation to endorse Sanders over rival and Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton.Sanders  stands above all others as a true champion of postal workers and other workers throughout the country,  said Mark Dimondstein, the union s president, in a statement. The endorsement came from the union s 13-member executive board.The United States Postal Service (USPS) lost $5.5 billion last year. That is the eighth annual loss in a row and the third-highest ever. The only silver lining is that the loss was below the red-ink tsunami of $15.9 billion in 2012.Why does the federal government deliver the mail? Why does it have a monopoly over delivering the mail?Admittedly, the Postal Service is one of the few government programs with actual constitutional warrant. The Constitution authorizes Congress to establish post offices. And early American politicians rushed to take advantage of their opportunity, creating the Post Office Department in 1792.With politics rather than service as the post office s priority, Congress took the next step and approved the Private Express Statutes, which prevented anyone from competing with the government in delivering first-class mail. And Uncle Sam enforced his monopoly, fining would-be competitors, including celebrated libertarian author Lysander Spooner.The feds continue to prosecute anyone with the temerity to compete with the USPS, even threatening the Cub Scouts for once offering to deliver Christmas cards.Believing that Americans existed to serve the USPS left the system ill-equipped to adapt to changing circumstances. In 1971, Congress turned the Post Office Department into the semi-independent USPS. That removed its direct role in politics, but the USPS still is exempt from taxes and regulations, including local parking restrictions. Congress retained its control over postal policies and, of course, preserved the system s delivery monopoly.But banning competition could not preserve the postal market. The number of pieces of mail peaked in 2001 and continues to fall despite a rising population. Mail pieces dropped from 213 billion in 2006 to 155 billion last year, and the number is expected to decline to 130 billion by 2020. The USPS s last profitable year was 2006. Since then, losses have run between $2.8 billion and $15.9 billion. The Postal Service has maxed out its borrowing from Uncle Sam and missed four retiree program payments. With characteristic understatement, the Government Accountability Office observed,  Given its financial problems and outlook, USPS cannot support its current level of service and operations. The postal unions insist that nothing is wrong   at least, nothing that a federal bailout wouldn t solve. They reserve particular ire for the requirement that the USPS prefund workers  retirement. Had this rule not been in place, noted former postmaster general Patrick Donahoe, the Postal Service would have earned money last year.But prefunding protects taxpayers. Washington s unfunded (government) retirement liability is about $800 billion and growing every year. That no other agency is required to prefund is unfair to taxpayers, not the Postal Service, since every agency should have to set aside sufficient money to fulfill its financial promises. With the Postal Service earning too little to pay and with nothing left of its federal credit line, the USPS has defaulted four times over the last three years on its mandated contributions.Sanders has long been a vocal backer of a robust postal service, particularly during the postal reform debate of recent years. APWU views itself as fighting a battle against postal service privatization, and it counts the Vermont senator as perhaps its leading defender.As the postal service bleeds millions in losses   mostly due to unique funding mandates placed upon it by Congress   Sanders has staunchly opposed the closure of postal facilities and cuts in postal service, such as Saturday delivery. He is also a leading proponent of the concept of postal banking, which would allow post offices to provide small loans and compete with payday lenders. Postal banking is a top issue for APWU, and Sanders has sought to make it a campaign issue.In his statement, Dimondstein noted Sanders  long history of standing with workers on picket lines, as well as his support for a national $15 per hour minimum wage. Sanders spoke at a protest against Verizon last month that was held by the Communications Workers of America union, and he joined a Fight for $15 rally outside the U.S. Capitol building earlier this week.Via: Huffington Post ',\n",
       " ' WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s promise to use existing funds to begin immediate construction of a wall on the U.S.-Mexico border has hit a financial roadblock, according to a document seen by Reuters.  The rapid start of construction, promised throughout Trump’s campaign and in an executive order issued in January on border security, was to be financed, according to the White House, with “existing funds and resources” of the Department of Homeland Security.  But so far, the DHS has identified only $20 million that can be re-directed to the multi-billion-dollar project, according to a document prepared by the agency and distributed to congressional budget staff last week.  The document said the funds would be enough to cover a handful of contracts for wall prototypes, but not enough to begin construction of an actual barrier. This means that for the wall to move forward, the White House will need to convince Congress to appropriate funds.

An internal report, previously reported by Reuters, estimated that fully walling off or fencing the entire southern border would cost $21.6 billion - $9.3 million per mile of fence and $17.8 million per mile of wall.  DHS officials did not respond to a request for comment on this story.  Trump has said he will ask Congress to pay for what existing funds cannot cover and that Mexico will be pressured to pay back U.S. taxpayers at a later date.  Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan has said he will include funding for a border wall in the budget for next fiscal year. He has estimated the cost to be between $12 billion and $15 billion.  Many Republican lawmakers have said they would vote against a plan that does not offset the cost of the wall with spending cuts.  In the document it submitted to Congress, the DHS said it would reallocate $5 million from a fence project in Naco, Arizona, that came in under budget and $15 million from a project to install cameras on top of trucks at the border.  The surveillance project was awarded to Virginia-based Tactical Micro, but was held up due to protests from other contractors, according to the DHS document. Tactical Micro could not be reached for comment.  The DHS only searched for extra funds within its $376 million budget for border security fencing, infrastructure and technology, so it would not have to ask for congressional approval to repurpose funding, according to the document.  Contractors cannot begin bidding to develop prototypes until March 6 but more than 265 businesses already have listed themselves as “interested parties” on a government web site.  Those interested range from small businesses to large government contractors such as Raytheon (RTN.N).  ',\n",

I think he does recognize that he has this alt-right army behind him. I think he also realizes if he backs down, if he stops being combative, he is in danger of losing that. Indeed, Donald Trump has embraced white supremacists by retweeting their accounts on his own Twitter feed and using rhetoric that appeals to them.In fact, despite his attempt to paint Democrats as the real racist fascists in this election, Trump is actually the candidate that white nationalists are drawn to. Virtually every alt-right Nazi I know is volunteering for the Trump campaign,  said white nationalist Andrew Anglin.David Duke, the former KKK leader who is running for the U.S. Senate in Louisiana, bragged to the Times that Trump is where he is because of white supremacists.  Trump happened because of us,  Duke said,  not the other way around. The fact that Donald Trump s doing so well, it proves that I m winning,  Duke continued.  I am winning. And if David Duke wins, it means the Nazis and the KKK win, too.So are we as Americans really prepared to let the Nazis take over the United States? Because if they do, they ll have control of the greatest military on the planet and we need to remember that when Hitler and the Nazis took power in Germany the first nation they conquered was their own and it resulted in concentration camps, indoctrination, loss of rights, and the eventual destruction of the entire nation. We can stop this new generation of Nazis from gaining power in the United States simply by making sure Trump loses by a landslide in November.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A major challenge to the U.S. watchdog for consumer finances fizzled on Thursday, as Congress missed a deadline to repeal the agency’s new rule on prepaid cards. Late last year, the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau issued a rule requiring greater disclosures and overdraft limits for the cards sold by companies such as Mastercard Inc. (MA.N) and Greendot and frequently used in place of paychecks. The timing made the rule eligible for Congress to repeal it under the Congressional Review Act (CRA), but lawmakers only had until Thursday to kill the regulation by passing a disapproval resolution in both chambers with simple majorities. Republican Senator David Perdue of Georgia, one of the agency’s biggest critics, had introduced a resolution that he tried to speed through his chamber, but congressional aides and advocacy groups said he could not gather enough votes. Perdue has repeatedly said the CFPB, created in the 2010 Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law to protect individuals against fraud, oversteps its authority. Earlier this week he said he intends to keep up pressure on the agency.  The resolution’s failure indicates that future regulations from the CFPB, reviled by many Republicans, may have shots at survival. The agency is led by Democrat Richard Cordray, was created by former President Barack Obama, a Democrat, and was originally conceived by Massachusetts Senator Elizabeth Warren, a leader in the liberal wing of the Democratic Party. The CFPB was expected to soon finalize restrictions on the fine print in contracts known as “mandatory arbitration clauses” that require consumers to give up their rights to class-action lawsuits as a condition of buying a service or product. But the rule’s fate has been caught in limbo. Congress is expected to kill it swiftly with a CRA resolution once it is official. While the first half-dozen CRA resolutions flew easily through Congress, repealing a wide spectrum of Obama-era regulations, the final resolutions faced a tougher time. One limiting methane emissions from oil and gas production on public lands failed on Wednesday. All told, Congress killed 14 regulations since Feb. 1. Lawmakers could still vote after this week to repeal rules that Obama finished in the last six months of his administration, but they will need super-majorities in each chamber, which is nearly impossible to achieve in the more closely divided Senate.

       " 'Everything he does is definitely NOT for hateful Republicans, as rock singer Bryan Adams just cancelled an upcoming concert in Mississippi rather than perform in a state where discrimination is legal.Mississippi Republicans passed a bigoted law earlier this month giving business owners and religious organizations the ability to fire employees and refuse service to customers who don t meet their extreme religious standards.So if you are gay or have pre-marital sex or are involved in an interracial relationship, businesses can discriminate against you and hide behind their Bibles to do so.Because of the law they passed, Mississippi Republicans may have cost their state billions of federal dollars, which they desperately need considering Mississippi is the top state in the nation when it comes to getting more money from the government than it pays in taxes.Corporations have also condemned the law and are threatening to no longer do business with or in the state as long as the law remains on the books. And now concerts are being cancelled.Just as Bruce Springsteen cancelled a concert in North Carolina over a similar law passed by Republicans there, Bryan Adams has cancelled his concert in Mississippi for the same reasons. Mississippi has passed anti-LGBT  Religious Liberty  bill 1523,  Adams wrote in a statement on his website. I find it incomprehensible that LGBT citizens are being discriminated against in the state of Mississippi. I cannot in good conscience perform in a State where certain people are being denied their civil rights due to their sexual orientation. Therefore i m cancelling my 14 April show at the Mississippi Coast Coliseum. Using my voice I stand in solidarity with all my LGBT friends to repeal this extremely discriminatory bill. Hopefully Mississippi will right itself and I can come back and perform for all of my many fans. I look forward to that day. If any Bryan Adams fans are angry about the singer s stand against discrimination and bigotry, they only have Mississippi Republicans to blame for legalizing hate in their hate in the first place.Featured image via Wikimedia',\n",
       " 'PARIS (Reuters) - In tight-knit groups with their backpacks hanging in front where they can keep an eye on them, Chinese tourists walked around Paris on their guard on Monday, alarmed by a recent mugging and other attacks targeting Asian visitors.  We like Paris but we are a bit scared,  Chinese tour guide Jenny Xu said as she lead a group around the department store district hours after China s foreign ministry said France needed to step up security after a high-profile robbery.  Chinese tourists, they are afraid for their safety in Paris,  said Xu, speaking in English as she recounted some of her own clients experiences of being mugged in shops or museums.   We tell them again and again to have their bags in front of them. And I tell them not to take so much cash.   France has in the past promised to do more to protect the safety of Chinese tourists, who come to Paris in ever larger numbers and have become more of a target for the cash they often carry and the luxury goods they buy. Last week, a group of 40 Chinese tourists was tear-gassed and robbed by four men in the parking lot of their hotel near Orly airport, south of Paris. While the muggings are not good for the city s reputation, and tourism was hit hard by the Islamist attacks of 2015, Paris still attracted 16 million visitors in the first half of 2017, making it one of the most popular cities in the world.          Chang Hui Ying, a tour operator from Taiwan who leads Chinese and Taiwanese groups across Europe, said Paris was the city where she was most worried about client safety.  One hour ago, when I was leaving the Louvre museum, two girls opened my bag and I was almost robbed,  she said, adding that once a whole week s worth of wages was stolen from her bag in the French capital.   There really are a lot of thieves,  she said.  But they still want to come. We like to shop here,  she said as she led a group to a store especially dedicated to Chinese visitors which the Galeries Lafayette chain opened earlier this year.  Tourists said they were taking extra precautions.   We put a small wallet somewhere and more money deeper inside (our bag), and the bag always in front,  said Chang Hui-Neng, speaking English with the help of her guide.  A group of hoteliers deplored last week s mugging and called for more protection.  More needs to be done to avoid such tragic events that have a lot of impact on Paris  image and that of France as a tourism destination,  UMIH said in a statement. With no backpack or shopping bags that would mark her as a tourist, 23-year-old Chinese student Wang Xi Qing, who has been living in France for 18 months, said she knew here way around and felt comfortable. But she said she tells friends who visit to be careful, especially since one of them got mugged in Notre Dame cathedral.  It s important to be aware,  she said. ',\n",

The 150 portions of piazu, made by his mother from the aid package the family received after fleeing violence in Myanmar, sell for 1 taka each, or a little more than 1 U.S. cent.  I started my trading here with the relief I got,  Mohammad told Reuters.  I did not buy anything. I got this relief package five days ago and my mum made this piazu this morning.  Myanmar s Rohingya Muslims have endured killings, arson and rape by Myanmar troops and ethnic Rakhine Buddhist vigilantes since Aug. 25, in response to Rohingya insurgent attacks on security posts, the United Nations says. It says problems like children trafficking existed in Bangladesh s camps, even before they were overwhelmed by the more than 600,000 new arrivals. Now, driven by a need for food and other essentials, trade is starting to thrive in the Palong Khali camp, located about 4 km (2.5 miles) from the Naf River that marks the border between Bangladesh and Myanmar. For the photo essay on trading inside the camps click on: reut.rs/2A5Sg7v Some refugees are returning to their previous occupations to eke out a living. Abul Fayaj, a 50-year-old vegetable seller from Buthidaung township in Rakhine, now sells green chilies to residents of the camp. He said a Bangladeshi lent him money for the chilies, which he sells for 200 taka ($2.39) per kg, higher than the local market price of 130 taka per kg.  I don t have the money to take lots of food, that s why I have to take a loan,  he said.  I have to pay more to the lender who gave me the money to buy the vegetables, so there is only a small profit,  said Fayaj, adding he takes home 100 taka a day. Obaidul Mannan, 40, with five daughters and two sons, traded clocks in Myanmar until the military came to his village, arresting people and burning homes.      He now sells betel nut that he bought with 9 grams (0.3 ounces) of gold that belonged to his wife. His complaints are common to shopkeepers everywhere.  The problem I m facing here is that I m selling next door to traders who are also selling the same items,  he said. Some Bangladeshi shopkeepers have hired Rohingya to run shops within the camp. Kalim Ullah, 42, fled from the Buthidaung area with his wife, six sons and a daughter. He used to transport goods in Myanmar, but was told that Rohingya could not own a business in Bangladesh. Ullah joined up with a local business owner and now sells snacks and red chilies in the camp for a daily wage of 100 taka. Two Bangladesh government officials confirmed that the refugees are not legally allowed to own businesses in the country since they are not citizens.  We are giving all kind of humanitarian assistance. They are not our citizens,  said a senior home ministry official.  The Myanmar government will have to take them back.  Bangladeshis are aware of the opportunities that the Rohingya exodus provides for trade and a number of them have moved closer to the camps. Abdur Razzak, 26, sells knives, pots and water buckets in the Palong Khali camp where he set up shop three months ago. After paying rent on his shop, wages for two assistants and transporting goods from the town of Ukhia, about 9 km (5.4 miles) north of the camp, Razzak earns about 500 taka profit on sales of 2,000 taka.   I m not making a lot of money. I just profit a little,  he said. ($1 = 83.7000 taka) ',\n",

If she cared so much, why is she so willing to carry out the legacy of black genocide by Planned Parenthood founder and white supremacist Margaret Sanger? If she really cared about the Black community, why is she not fighting taxpayer funded Planned Parenthood abortion clinics on every inner-city corner in America? Planned Parenthood is the largest abortion provider in America. 78% of their clinics are in minority communities. Blacks make up 12% of the population, but 35% of the abortions in America.  Colored people are like human weeds and are to be exterminated.  Margaret Sanger, Planned Parenthood founderDonald Trump made a bold move today that proves his commitment to the Black community.  Trump issued a call to make permanent the Hyde Amendment that bans almost all federal taxpayer funding of abortions and is credited with saving the lives of over 1 million Americans from abortion. Trump- s call comes as Hillary Clinton is campaigning in reversing Hyde and forcing Americans to fund free abortions for women with their tax dollars.Every year, Congress is forced to fight the battle to protect Americans from being forced to pay for abortions with their tax dollars. Democrats annually fight the pro-life budget provision and hope they can eventually reverse it should they take control of both the White House and Congress.That has led to pro-life groups calling to the adoption of a permanent law putting Hyde in place long-term and making it more difficult for pro-abortion forces to reverse. Today, Trump announced his support for such a law.The call for banning taxpayer funding of abortions comes in a new letter from Trump. Trump commits to a new policy:  Making the Hyde Amendment permanent law to protect taxpayers from having to pay for abortions. Hillary Clinton s unwavering commitment to advancing taxpayer-funded abortion on-demand stands in stark contrast to the commitments I ve made,  Trump writes,  to advance the rights of unborn children and their mothers when elected president.

       " 'Rep. Mo Brooks (R-AL)   a congressman who at one time cracked jokes about shooting undocumented immigrants   has recently called President Barack Obama out for being  the most racially-divisive president  America s had since slavery.Brooks, who happens to be the chairman of GOP presidential candidate Ted Cruz s Alabama leadership team, made these comments during a radio interview on the Dale Jackson Show on Thursday. Commenting on the president s State of the Union speech, the Alabama Republican said, There probably has not been a more racially-divisive, economically divisive, president in the White House since we had presidents who supported slavery. Host Dale Jackson pressed Brooks to clarify what exactly he meant   considering that Obama is the nation s first black president   and Brooks  explanation threw Obama a bone for not being the absolute worst president in the entire history of the United States   just within the last 150 years: We did have presidents in the first 80 to 100 years of our country that supported slavery. You cannot say Barack Obama was worse than them. But he s probably the worst one since the Civil War and the passages of the 13th, 14th, and 15th Amendments. You can listen to the recording of the show below: Later in the show, Jackson commented on how much racial tensions have become a focal point in the political arena, and Brooks accused Obama and Democrats of using race and sex to divide Americans  to a level of perfection not heretofore seen. In true GOP fashion, Brooks chose not to give specific reasons why Obama was  racially divisive    but his Civil War comment means that he s forgotten quite a bit about history, and how racist some of America s presidents from the last 150 years were. To say that Obama is more racially divisive than post-Civil War presidents such as Andrew Jackson, Rutherford Hayes, Woodrow Wilson and even George W. Bush is absolutely ridiculous.Brooks should know a bit about being racially divisive himself   he s made several racist statements in the past. For example, there was that time he said Syrian refugees wanted a  paid vacation,  spread lies about Obama s childhood past in Indonesia, blamed a measles outbreak on  illegal aliens,  and stated that Obama s immigration policy was based on  skin pigmentation.

Gen. H.R. McMaster on Friday in which he asked some questions the White House really doesn t want to answer.The letter made it clear that Cummings wants to know just exactly who knew what when. Over the past two days, press accounts have reported that staff who work directly for you contacted Rep. Devin Nunes, the Chairman of the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, secured his entry into the White House complex on March 21, 2017, and provided him with access to classified information, which he then conveyed to the President the following day.  I am writing to request information about whether you both were aware of these actions I do not know if these press accounts are accurate, but if they are, they raise serious questions in light of previous denials by the White House and the fact that these White House officials report to you,  Cummings wrote. The Democratic congressman cited multiple conflicting reports that have come from the administration. After naming the staffers and the allegations against each of them, Cummings asked five questions that have the White House scared to death:(1)  Were either of you personally aware of the activities of your own staff in contacting Chairman Nunes, facilitating his entry onto the White House grounds, or providing him with access to classified information?(2)  If so, when did you become aware?  Did you inform Mr. Spicer of their activities, and if so, when did you do so?(3)  If you were not aware, then how did this breach of the chain of command occur?(4)  If these activities occurred without your knowledge, will any disciplinary measures be taken against these staff for this apparent breach?(5)  Was anyone else at the White House involved in these activities, and if so, who?Cummings  questions should have the Trump administration shaking in their boots.

       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - Outgoing CIA Director John Brennan has said it would be the “height of folly” for U.S. President-elect Donald Trump to tear up Washington’s deal with Tehran because it would make it more likely that Iran and others would acquire nuclear weapons. “It could lead to a weapons program inside of Iran that could lead other states in the region to embark on their own programs,” Brennan said in an interview with the BBC aired on Wednesday.  “So I think it would be the height of folly if the next administration were to tear up that agreement.” Brennan also said that in dealing with the Syrian crisis, Trump should be cautious in trying to work with Russia. “I hope there is going to be an improvement in relations between Washington and Moscow,” he said. “President-elect Trump and the new administration need to be wary of Russian promises.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - After an internet-fueled furor over rules barring women in sleeveless attire, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan pledged on Thursday that House officials would review and perhaps modernize the chamber’s dress code. Ryan made his announcement a week after a CBS News report about the long-standing rules went viral on social media. It prompted a slew of reports, including some falsely accusing Ryan of unfairly targeting women, especially given Washington’s notoriously hot summers. The current dress code has been in place for years, including under Nancy Pelosi, a Democrat who was the only woman to serve as House Speaker, from 2007-11. “This is nothing new and certainly not something that I devised,” Ryan said at a news conference. “At the same time, that doesn’t mean that enforcement couldn’t stand to be a bit modernized.” The dress code requires men to wear suit jackets and ties in the House chamber and speaker’s lobby, which is just outside it, and women are not supposed to wear sleeveless tops or dresses without a sweater or jacket. Neither men nor women are allowed to wear open or athletic footwear. Ryan made clear that all of those standards would not go away. “Decorum is important, especially for this institution,” he said. “And a dress code in the chamber, in the lobby makes sense. But we also don’t need to bar otherwise accepted contemporary business attire. So look for a change on that soon.” Amid a flurry of news articles, women House members jumped into the fray. Democratic Representative Jackie Speier circulated a flyer urging women lawmakers to wear sleeveless dresses on “Sleeveless Friday” on July 14, with a photo on the Capitol steps after the day’s first vote. Republican Representative Martha McSally noted she was wearing an outfit that violated the code as she ended a speech in the House chamber on Wednesday. “I want to point out that I’m standing here in my professional attire, which happens to be a sleeveless dress and open-toed shoes,” McSally said. It was not McSally’s first brush with dress codes. In 2001 when she was an Air Force fighter pilot, McSally sued then-Secretary of Defense Donald Rumsfeld over the military’s policy of requiring military women in Saudi Arabia to wear a head-to-toe “abaya” when off base. Pelosi took to social media to welcome Ryan’s statement.  “These unwritten rules are in desperate need of updates,” she said on Twitter. ',\n",

       " 'DUBLIN (Reuters) - The key to British hopes of moving on to talks on trade ties with the European Union after it quits the bloc lies in Dublin, the European Council president said on Friday as Ireland called for  credible  solutions from London for the Irish border.  Avoiding a return to a  hard border  on the island of Ireland is the last major hurdle before Brexit talks can advance to trade ties and a possible two-year Brexit transition deal. But European Council President Donald Tusk that while the EU negotiating team represents the interests of the 27 other members, Ireland will have the final say on the border issue.   Let me say very clearly: if the UK offer is unacceptable for Ireland, it will also be unacceptable for the EU,  Tusk said in Dublin at a joint press conference with Irish Prime Minister Leo Varadkar.   The key to the UK s future lies - in some ways - in Dublin, at least as long as Brexit negotiations continue.    Tusk confirmed he had given British Prime Minister Theresa May a deadline of Monday to make a final offer on Irish border conditions before EU heads of government decide whether there is  sufficient progress  on a UK-EU divorce settlement to merit opening talks on the future relationship. If London meets the three key EU conditions on its financial bill for leaving, the rights of expatriate citizens and the border, then leaders could give a green light to trade talks at the summit on Dec. 14-15. With significant headway on the financial settlement and citizen rights now apparently in the bag, a deal on the Irish border appears to be the final hurdle. The political and economic stakes are high. The economy of Ireland, north and south, has become deeply integrated since the EU single market s creation in 1993, and only road signs now mark the frontier. Free-flowing commerce, together with the 1998 peace deal between Northern Ireland s Protestants and Catholics, has transformed previously neglected areas on both sides of the boundary. Varadkar said that while progress on the border issue had been made, the next few days would be crucial and that Ireland would not be afraid to use its veto if necessary.   The UK must offer credible, concrete and workable solutions that guarantee that there will be no hard border...whatever the future relationship between the EU and the UK is,  he said.  I m an optimist by nature...However I m also prepared to stand firm with our partners if need be...if the UK offer falls short.   Before it can sign off on the first phase, Dublin wants May to spell out in writing how she intends to make good on a commitment to avoid turning the clock back to a border of customs and security checks. It says the best way to do so is to keep regulations the same on both sides of a border that will be the UK s only land boundary with the EU after Brexit. May s government has said Britain will leave the EU s single market and customs union but wants the Irish border to remain open, a stance that EU officials say is contradictory. Earlier on Friday Irish Foreign Minister Simon Coveney said a deal on the border was  doable  but that the sides were  not there yet. Coveney said negotiators were working to find  sensible wording , drafts of which were being exchanged. Dublin, he said, will insist  there will be no fudge . May s room to offer additional concessions to Dublin appeared extremely limited when the pro-Brexit Northern Ireland party propping up her government on Thursday hinted it might withdraw its support if she gives up too much.  But Coveney said the Irish government and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP) agreed on far more than it disagreed on.  May is also under pressure from British business leaders who want confirmation of a transition deal so they have time to adapt to the new relationship.  ',\n",

       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - A former personal assistant to an exiled Chinese-born billionaire, who has made claims of high-level Communist Party corruption, has filed a lawsuit in New York accusing him of raping her, court documents show. In the civil complaint lodged with the New York Supreme Court on Monday, the 28-year-old woman said she was  lured  by the businessman, Guo Wengui, to New York under the guise of a one-week business trip. Instead, she was held  captive  and ultimately subjected to  repeated acts of mental cruelty and sexual violence , the suit says. She is seeking $140 million in compensation. Guo, who lives in New York, denied the accusation, describing it as  fake . The complaint says the woman is a Chinese national who was employed by one of Guo s China-based companies. She was told upon arrival in New York that she would work as one of the real estate tycoon s personal assistants, the complaint, reviewed by Reuters, says. It said Guo, also known as Miles Kwok,  forcibly took away  the woman s passport, threatened her, monitored her internet usage and restricted access to her phone and laptop computer. The woman said she was subjected to verbal and physical abuse, which soon escalated to sexual assault, before she managed to escape to the Chinese embassy in London during a business trip with Guo. After her return to China, the woman provided a statement and evidence of her allegations to police in China, the lawsuit said, without detailing the evidence. The Associated Press reported late last month that Chinese police were investigating the woman s claims. Guo refuted the accusation.  Of course it s fake,  he told Reuters. He said the  robbers of the country  engineered the allegations to  divert my attention, spread rumors and smear my reputation.  Guo, who left China in 2014, has named senior Communist Party officials in a deluge of graft accusations via Twitter posts and video blogs, attracting a loyal online following. He has provided little evidence for his claims. China calls Guo a criminal suspect, and articles in state media have accused him of crimes including bribery, fraud and embezzlement. At China s request, Interpol issued a global  red notice  for Guo s repatriation in April. Guo lodged an application for political asylum in the United States last week. ',\n",

Mrs Clinton announced her intention to seek the Democratic nomination on Sunday   and set upon the campaign trail with a trip to meet  ordinary  voters in Iowa.But she was blasted for her  staged  visit on Tuesday morning to a coffee shop in LeClaire, Iowa.Austin Bird, one of the men pictured sitting at the table with Mrs Clinton, claimed the whole event was orchestrated  from beginning to end .Bird told Daily Mail Online that campaign staffer Troy Price called and asked him and two other young people to meet him Tuesday morning at a restaurant in Davenport, a nearby city. Price then drove them to the coffee house to meet Clinton after vetting them for about a half-hour.The three got the lion s share of Mrs. Clinton s time and participated in what breathless news reports described as a  roundtable  the first of many in her brief Iowa campaign swing. Bird himself is a frequent participant in Iowa Democratic Party events. He interned with President Obama s 2012 presidential re-election campaign, and was tapped to chauffeur Vice President Joe Biden in October 2014 when he visited Davenport. What happened is, we were just asked to be there by Troy,  Bird said Wednesday in a phone interview. We were asked to come to a meeting with Troy, the three of us, at the Village Inn. The other two, he confirmed, were University of Iowa College Democrats president Carter Bell and Planned Parenthood of the Heartland employee Sara Sedlacek. It was supposed to be a strategy meeting,  Bird recalled,  to get our thoughts about issues. But then all of a sudden he says,  Hey, we have Secretary Clinton coming in, would you like to go meet her? And then we got in a car   Troy s car   and we went up to the coffee house, and we sat at a table and then Hillary just came up and talked with us. Bird said  we all were called. I mean, Troy asked us all to do   to go to a meeting with him. And we didn t really know what it was about. I mean, he did. He knew. Via: UK Daily Mail',\n",

       " 'BENGHAZI, Libya (Reuters) - Two months after the dominant military force in eastern Libya declared victory in a campaign to retake Benghazi, Hassan al-Zawy is living rough in his home in the district that witnessed the city s last major battle. Like many other residents, he ventured back as Khalifa Haftar s Libyan National Army gradually wrested back control from Islamist militants and other rebel groups. Parts of Libya s second city were reduced to rubble during more than three years of fighting and, with economic crisis and political turmoil gripping the country, rebuilding is a daunting challenge.  There are flies, mosquitoes and garbage. At night, we have absolutely nothing,  Zawy told Reuters in mid-August in the seafront neighborhood of Sabri.  We ve been here for one month and 10 days and all we want from the state is (this): electricity and water, and for people to return to their homes, and stay there.  A conflict that developed after strongman Muammar Gaddafi was toppled in an uprising six years ago has yet to be resolved. Benghazi, where the 2011 revolution started, has seen some of the worst violence. Tens of thousands of residents, many opposed to Haftar, were displaced to other Libyan cities. Sabri is where Haftar s rivals had their final strongholds, and was bombarded by LNA heavy artillery and air strikes up until a few weeks ago. Sporadic fighting continued after Haftar announced victory on July 5.. People recover what they can from the rubble of ruined buildings. Children help with the cleanup.  Afterwards, men sit outside drinking tea or coffee and guarding their streets. One says he will stay in his home even if he has to hang towels over the doors and windows.  Another Sabri resident, Farag Mahmoud, said some people were so keen to get back to their homes that they were ignoring the risk from land mines still planted in parts of the district.   We found our homes had been flooded from broken pipes in the plumbing systems, and were submerged in water around 70 to 80 centimeters deep,  he said. Some returning residents have formed citizens  committees to lobby the municipal authorities on water, electricity and hygiene, said Milad Fadlallah, a local engineer. Most residents in the less severely damaged eastern part of Sabri would be able to spend the Muslim holiday of Eid al-Adha, which starts on Sept. 1, back in their neighborhood, Fadlallah said. But a lack of funds and political leadership in a country still divided between two rival governments will hinder reconstruction, said Osama al-Kaza, director of projects at Benghazi s municipality. In Benghazi, the conflict has also had left deep physical and psychological scars.  Achieving an outstanding and modern image for the city will have to be done in stages, will take years and cost billions,  he said. (Story refiles to add dropped  s  in second paragraph.) ',\n",
       " ' Admitting Somalis who d been settled for years in Pakistan   like the Ohio State jihadi and his family   is only one of them. Another  refugee  absurdity was revealed recently   the Obama administration has agreed to admit illegal aliens intercepted at sea by Australia and held in camps outside that country, on two Pacific islands.The number of people said to be affected is reported to range from 1,600 to nearly 2,500; my colleague Nayla Rush has an overview here. These are people Australia has decided do not warrant refugee status (or what our law would consider asylum). Therefore they have no right to move to Australia. But for a variety of reasons, Australia cannot, or does not want to, send them back, and the  refugees  won t accept offers of resettlement in New Guinea or Cambodia because they re holding out for a First World country. What s more, their presence in those Australian-run camps on the islands of Nauru and Manus (the latter owned by Papua New Guinea) has become a political headache. Most are from Iran, with smaller numbers from Pakistan, Afghanistan, Iraq, Somalia, and elsewhere.I can see why Australia would want this deal; it costs Oz taxpayers $2 billion to run the two island detention facilities and closing them down would rid the government of the headache. But if Australia doesn t consider them refugees, why should we take them?It appears we re doing this as a favor to Australia; some speculate it s a quid pro quo for Australia s taking some U.S.-bound illegals in camps in Costa Rica, though how that s comparable isn t clear, and Australia has denied any such bargain. The chairman of the House and Senate Judiciary Committees, Bob Goodlatte and Chuck Grassley, also want to know why we re doing this, and they wrote to the secretaries of State and Homeland Security asking for details on the secret agreement to bring the illegal aliens here.

       " 'MIAMI (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday ordered tighter restrictions on Americans traveling to Cuba and a clampdown on U.S. business dealings with the Caribbean island’s military, saying he was canceling former President Barack Obama’s “terrible and misguided deal” with Havana. Laying out his new Cuba policy in a speech in Miami, Trump  signed a presidential directive rolling back parts of Obama’s historic opening to the Communist-ruled country after a 2014 diplomatic breakthrough between the two former Cold War foes. But Trump left in place many of Obama’s changes, including the reopened U.S. embassy in Havana, even as he sought to show he was making good on a campaign promise to take a tougher line against Cuba, especially over its human rights record. “We will not be silent in the face of communist oppression any longer,” Trump told a cheering crowd in Miami’s Cuban-American enclave of Little Havana, including Republican Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, who helped forge the new restrictions on Cuba. “Effective immediately, I am canceling the last administration’s completely one-sided deal with Cuba,” Trump declared as he made a full-throated assault on the government of Cuban President Raul Castro. Cuba later denounced the move as a setback in U.S.-Cuban relations, saying Trump had been badly advised and was resorting to “coercive methods of the past” that were doomed to fail. The government remained willing to engage in “respectful dialogue,” it said in a statement. Trump’s revised approach calls for stricter enforcement of a longtime ban on Americans going to Cuba as tourists, and seeks to prevent U.S. dollars from being used to fund what the Trump administration sees as a repressive military-dominated government. (tmsnrt.rs/2rBfMTI) But, facing pressure from U.S. businesses and even some fellow Republicans to avoid turning back the clock completely in relations with Cuba, the president chose to leave intact some of his Democratic predecessor’s steps toward normalization.     The new policy bans most U.S. business transactions with the Armed Forces Business Enterprises Group, a Cuban conglomerate involved in all sectors of the economy. But it makes some exceptions, including for air and sea travel, according to U.S. officials. This will essentially shield U.S. airlines and cruise lines serving the island.  “We do not want U.S. dollars to prop up a military monopoly that exploits and abuses the citizens of Cuba,” Trump said, pledging that U.S. sanctions would not be lifted until Cuba frees political prisoners and holds free elections. While the changes are far-reaching, they appear to be less sweeping than many U.S. pro-engagement advocates had feared.     Trump based his partial reversal of Obama’s Cuba measures largely on human rights grounds. His critics, however, have questioned why his administration is now singling out Cuba for human rights abuses but downplaying the issue in other parts of the world, including Saudi Arabia, a close U.S. ally Trump visited last month where political parties and protests are banned. Trump, however, stopped short of breaking diplomatic relations restored in 2015 after more than five decades of hostilities. He also will not cut off recently resumed direct U.S.-Cuba commercial flights or cruise-ship travel, though his more restrictive policy seems certain to dampen new economic ties overall. The administration, according to one White House official, has no intention of “disrupting” existing business ventures such as one struck under Obama by Starwood Hotels Inc, which is owned by Marriott International Inc, to manage a historic Havana hotel.     Nor does Trump plan to reinstate limits that Obama lifted on the amount of the island’s coveted rum and cigars that Americans can bring home for personal use.     Still, it will be the latest attempt by Trump to overturn parts of Obama’s presidential legacy. He has already pulled the United States out of a major international climate treaty and is trying to scrap his predecessor’s landmark healthcare program. When Obama announced the detente in 2014, he said that decades of U.S. efforts to achieve change in Cuba by isolating the island had failed and it was time to try a new approach. Critics of the rapprochement said Obama was giving too much away without extracting concessions from the Cuban government. Castro’s government has clearly stated it does not intend to change its one-party political system. Trump aides say Obama’s efforts amounted to “appeasement” and have done nothing to advance political freedoms in Cuba, while benefiting the Cuban government financially. “It’s hard to think of a policy that makes less sense than the prior administration’s terrible and misguided deal with the Castro regime,” Trump said in Miami. International human rights groups say, however, that renewed U.S. efforts to isolate the island could worsen the situation by empowering Cuban hard-liners. The Cuban government, which has made clear it will not be pressured into reforms, had no immediate comment. But ordinary Cubans said they were crestfallen to be returning to an era of frostier relations with the United States with potential economic fallout for them. “It’s like we are returning to the Cold War,” said Cuban designer Idania del Rio, who joined a group of friends in a hotel in Old Havana to watch the speech in English on CNN. Trump announced his new approach at the Manuel Artime Theater in the heart of the United States’ largest Cuban-American and Cuban exile community, whose support aides believe helped him win Florida in the election. The venue is named after a leader of the failed U.S.-backed Bay of Pigs invasion of Cuba in 1961 against Fidel Castro’s revolutionary government. “I have trust in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to Cuba,” said Jorge Saurez, 66, a retired physician in Little Havana. Trump’s vow to keep the broader decades-old U.S. economic embargo on Cuba firmly in place drew criticism from some U.S. farmers, especially growers of corn, soybeans and rice. Obama’s détente has already lifted exports and raised hopes for more gains, which they said were now in doubt.     Mexico’s foreign ministry urged the United States and Cuba to resolve their differences “via dialogue.” But Venezuelan President Nicolas Maduro, whose leftist government is Cuba’s main regional ally, slammed Trump’s tightening of restrictions as an “offence” against Latin America. “His speech was aggressive and threatening, ... revealing his contempt and ignorance,” President Nicolas Maduro said in a speech. “We reject Donald Trump’s declarations against our brother Cuba. It is an offence against Latin America.” The biggest change in travel policy will be that Americans making educational people-to-people trips, one of the most popular authorized categories, can no longer go to the island on their own but only on group tours. Trump’s aides said the aim was to close off a path for Americans seeking beach vacations in a country where U.S. tourism is still officially banned. U.S. Senator Jeff Flake, one of the Republican Party’s most vocal advocates for easing rules  on U.S. dealings with Cuba, called for a vote on legislation lifting restrictions on American travel there. But the Republican leadership in Congress has long blocked such a move, and it appears unlikely to budge. Under Trump’s order, the Treasury and Commerce departments will be given 30 days to begin writing new regulations, which will not take effect until they are complete. In contentious deliberations leading up to the new policy, some aides argued that Trump, a former real estate magnate who won the presidency vowing to unleash U.S. business, would have a hard time defending any moves that close off the Cuban market. But other advisers have contended that it is important to make good on a campaign promise to Cuban-Americans. ',\n",
       " 'Trump and his team made a great deal of the campaign about Hillary Clinton s email security (including gleefully exploiting hacked emails stolen by Russia and released by Wikileaks), so one might think their own email security practices would be stellar. Alas, like so many of Trump s criticism of Hillary, his team s own security efforts are much, much worse.To prove this point, tech site Gizmodo created a  test  to see how well Trump s staff handles email security. Adding even more fuel to the fire, they also included James Comey   who had played a central role in perpetuating lies about Hillary Clinton s emails in the days leading up to the election.Three weeks ago, Gizmodo Media Group s Special Projects Desk launched a security preparedness test directed at Giuliani and 14 other people associated with the Trump Administration. We sent them an email that mimicked an invitation to view a spreadsheet in Google Docs. The emails came from the address [email protected], but the sender name each one displayed was that of someone who might plausibly email the recipient, such as a colleague, friend, or family member.Disturbingly, a number of Trump associates fell for it.Some of the Trump Administration people completely ignored our email, the right move. But it appears that more than half the recipients clicked the link: Eight different unique devices visited the site, one of them multiple times. There s no way to tell for sure if the recipients themselves did all the clicking (as opposed to, say, an IT specialist they d forwarded it to), but seven of the connections occurred within 10 minutes of the emails being sent.Even more disturbing, both Newt Gingrich and (now former FBI director) James Comey seemed to buy into the premise, while remaining slightly skeptical. Comey, for instance, asked the sender to explain to him what was in the attached document. Surely a better response than just clicking on it, but still dangerous. By asking a potential hacker to explain him or herself, the (former) FBI director only opened the door to further chances to be hacked. He also appeared to believe the email was really from a friend based solely on the name attached the the email account.Is it legal to do this? Some journalists were skeptical.@ashleyfeinberg Did did Gizmodo send the FBI director a spoofed email and then confess to the federal crime at the FBI director s expense on Gizmodo?  Brian Beutler (@brianbeutler) May 9, 2017However, Gizmodo s defense is pretty solid. For starters, they never collected any actual passwords or contact information for any of the recipients (regardless of whether the marks took the bait). Secondly, they slapped so many disclaimers on the emails that you would have to be extremely oblivious to not understand what was happening   a test which, it turns out, some of Trump s friends seem to have failed.For journalistic reasons it provides a lot of insight into just how susceptible some of Trump s closest advisers are to being hacked. Far from having the moral high ground to lecture Democrats, it turns out that Trump s team is comprised of technology-challenged suckers capable of exposing a lot of sensitive information to would-be hackers. If Gizmodo can trick them with an email containing numerous disclaimers that this was a potential hack, a real hack   infinitely more subtle   could be a serious threat.Comey himself acknowledged that it appears Russian attempts to hack America s democracy appears to be ongoing and warned that it would likely rear its ugly head in 2018 and 2020. He should be extra cautious.Meanwhile, it s unlikely that Trump will be able to appropriately respond to this threat. He may not even recognize it exists. He talked a mean game about Hillary s email security, but the closest he ever came to commenting on his own understanding of cyberwarfare was claiming his 10-year-old son Barron was good with computers. Given that level of ignorance, Trump isn t likely to start leading by example.Yikes.Featured image via Andrew Harrer-Pool/Getty Images',\n",

This caused Sean Spicer to completely lose it, and launch into condescending, sexist, and racist attacks on Ryan.After the press availability was over, Ryan spoke with MSNBC s Katy Tur about her experience, addressing the accusation from Sean Spicer that she was pushing an agenda rather than just reporting the facts. Ryan told Tur: I don t have an agenda. We ve never seen anything like this before and my question was simple, how do you change the perception problem? And it went off into this Russian dressing, no shaking my head or whatever. You cannot ignore, as a reporter, there are issues on Capitol Hill. You have investigations going. You have the head of the intel committee coming here to the White House briefing people, the president himself. I understand what Sean is doing  trying to make this administration look better than what it does right now. And unfortunately, I was roadkill today. No matter what Sean Spicer s job is, he had not right to treat April Ryan that way. She was just doing her job. If he can t handle tough questions, he should find another line of work. To flat-out deny all of those investigations, and to accuse the press of being at fault for the fact that the criminal activity that is clearly taking place inside the Trump White House is a huge story is truly beyond the pale.

Today, that vision of a hero Americans watched yesterday, who stood alone on the field, undeterred by angry leftists, determined to promote division and hate for our law enforcement, has been shattered.NYP  Pittsburgh Steelers offensive lineman Alejandro Villanueva, who broke with his team to stand for the national anthem on Sunday, became the best-selling NFL player Monday, according to a report.The former Army Ranger, who served three tours of duty in Afghanistan, was the only Steeler to appear for  The Star-Spangled Banner  before the game against the Chicago Bears.Alejandro Villanueva was the only Steeler to come out for the National Anthem, standing in the tunnel. pic.twitter.com/L4EtxRQSvA  CBS Sports (@CBSSports) September 24, 2017Fans rewarded Villanueva by purchasing his jersey, helping him to break a record for NFL jersey sales:His patriotic counterprotest while his teammates remained in the locker room helped him unseat New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady as the top gear seller in the league, ESPN reported.A spokesman for Fanatics, which runs the NFL s online store, confirmed that more Villanueva items, including jerseys and T-shirts, had been ordered than that of any other NFL player in the past 24 hours.Less than 24 hours after the dust settled, and Villanueva s teammates and coach had a chance to vocalize their feelings about him standing alone, Villaneuva made a shocking statement to the press about his decision.The Pittsburgh Steelers player who is being heralded for taking the field on Sunday for the national anthem despite the rest of the team boycotting has now revealed that it was all a big mistake, and he meant to be in the tunnel with his fellow players.  Unfortunately I threw my teammates under the bus, unintentionally,  Alejandro Villanueva said on Monday. Every single time I see that picture of me standing by myself I feel embarrassed. Villanueva then explained that he had asked to stand in the front of the team with the captains of the squad at the last second so that they showed some respect for wounder veterans.That plan backfired though when he did not stop to check that the captains were by his side as he walked to the opening of the tunnel, which is how the 6ft 9in lineman ended up in plain view on the field as the national anthem began to play.Watch:His admission comes after thousands across the country declared him a hero for his actions, and began purchasing his jersey in record numbers to show support for what they thought was a calculated move.Quarterback Ben Roethlisberger also said on Monday that he was meant to be by Villanueva s side at the time, but got held back by the melee in the tunnel after the tackle walked too far out.  Daily MailSocial media isn t buying Villanueva s story:Villanueva has now been pressured to apologize, after his coach criticized him. So much for HIS free speech. https://t.co/quHh76R5F6  Paul Joseph Watson (@PrisonPlanet) September 26, 2017 ',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Colony NorthStar Inc has ended a consulting agreement with Rick Gates, a former campaign aide to U.S. President Donald Trump, a spokesman for the real estate and financial firm said on Monday. Gates, who had been working as a consultant for Colony for six months, according to the spokesman, was indicted on Monday on charges of conspiracy to launder money and failing to report foreign bank accounts to the U.S. government.  The charges were part of a probe by Robert Mueller, a special counsel appointed to investigate whether Russia tried  to tilt the 2016 presidential election in Trump’s favor, and whether members of the Trump campaign colluded in any such effort.  Gates pleaded not guilty to all charges on Monday. David Bos, the lawyer who represented Gates in an appearance in federal court, declined to comment. Gates could not be reached for comment. A longtime associate of former Trump campaign chairman Paul Manafort, who was also indicted on Monday, Gates continued to work on Trump’s campaign after Manafort left in August 2016. Gates also worked with Colony NorthStar founder and executive chairman Thomas Barrack Jr. on Trump’s presidential inaugural committee, according to three sources who asked not to be identified. Barrack chaired the committee. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House Democratic Leader Nancy Pelosi on Thursday said the recent cyber attack on Democratic politicians was “broad” and that Russians were clearly behind the breach, adding that the damage was still being investigated. “It is the Russians,” Pelosi told reporters at a news conference, referring to the recent breach affecting the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee.  Pelosi called the attack, made public last month, an “electronic Watergate” akin to the 1972 burglary at Democratic Party headquarters at the Watergate office that upended the Nixon presidency. “This is a break-in.” Pelosi’s comments come on the heels of a New York Times report on Thursday that the cyber attack targeting Democrats was wider than first thought, with more than 100 party officials and groups were affected. The Democratic National Committee and U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton’s campaign was also affected. Asked if she was personally targeted, Pelosi said she did not know. “We are assessing the damage,” Pelosi told reporters, adding that she could not speak to the impact on any Democratic governors. The Obama administration has not publicly named Russia as behind the attack, but investigators have concluded the attackers were directed by the GRU, Russia’s military intelligence service, and the FSB, the civilian espionage agency. Clinton has also pointed to Moscow. Russia has denied involvement in the breach. A U.S. official familiar with the investigation said no evidence has been found so far that indicates the hackers got into Clinton’s personal server or any classified systems, but their footprints suggest they “paid special attention to accounts they thought might lead them to information of national security interest.” The official said the hackers apparently proceeded beyond the Democratic National Committee, the Clinton campaign, and the Democrats’ House of Representatives campaign committee to individual email accounts and probably other Democratic groups and individuals who emailed people using the accounts they first hacked. “The pattern fits what has come to be standard hacking practice,” said the official, who spoke on the condition of anonymity to discuss an ongoing investigation by government as well as private agencies. “You go as far as you can, hoping you find something useful.” ',\n",
       " 'While Bernie Sanders has pitched himself as the presidential candidate for the little guy   tapping into the wallets of voters angry over Wall Street s influence in politics   a deeper dive shows Sanders has enlisted an arsenal of millionaire and billionaire backers who have backed his political career since his early Senate runs a decade ago.That big-money support stands in sharp contrast to Sanders  calls for corporate fat-cats and the uber-wealthy to pay their  fair share  in taxes by closing loopholes and removing breaks that benefit the mega-rich.At a rally last Sunday at The Ohio State University, Sanders told a cheering crowd,  You can tell a lot about a candidate based on how he or she raises money for his or her campaign. The comment goes hand-in-hand with the theme Sanders has been hammering for months. I am not raising money from millionaires and billionaires,  Sanders said during the CNN Democratic primary debate in Las Vegas on Oct. 13.  In fact, tonight, in terms of what a political revolution is about, there are 4,000 house parties   100,000 people in this country   watching this debate tonight who want real change in this country. Sanders war chest has been driven by smaller donations   he raised $26 million in small increments in the third fund-raising quarter.Jeff Weaver, Sanders  campaign manager, insists the fancy fundraisers and big-name donors are few and far between and that there is no contradiction in what the Vermont Democrat and self-described socialist practices and what he preaches. We don t have a super PAC,  Weaver told FoxNews.com.  We rely on small contributions. Average contribution is $27. Are there some, a few people in there who have more money, personal money who give larger contributions? Yeah, of course they do, but within the federal $2700 limit. No, you know, no 50, 100, 2 million contributions. But for years Sanders has enjoyed donations from a handful of wealthy donors including media moguls Leo J. Hindery and Steven C. Markoff.Markoff, who donated to Sanders  2012 Senate campaign, began trading rare coins when he was 11. By 2004, his company A-Mark Entertainment was listed as the 65th largest privately held company in the U.S., and the second largest in Los Angeles.Hindrey, managing partner of the private equity fund InterMedia Partners and former chief executive of AT & T Broadband and of the YES Network, also maxed out on contributions to Sanders. Hindrey, while advocating for fewer tax breaks for the wealthy, is among the biggest Democratic fundraisers in the country.Another big money donor to Sanders  campaign is David Geffen, co-founder of DreamWorks Animation and worth a cool $6.9 billion. According to campaign finance records, Geffen donated the max at the time   $2,500   to Sanders Senate campaign on Jan. 27, 2012.But Lara Brown, director of George Washington University s political management program, told FoxNews.com that she doesn t see a big push-back from Sanders supporters. By and large, Democrats tend to believe these individuals are giving because they have a strong progressive/liberal orientation in their politics and they are doing this because it equates to them giving to a cause,  she said, adding that the same would be true for big-money donors in Silicon Valley and the tech industry.Via: FOX News ',\n",

       " 'NEW DELHI (Reuters) - India s foreign minister defended the country s ties with North Korea and Iran during talks on Wednesday with Secretary of State Rex Tillerson aimed at building robust relations between the two giant democracies. The Trump administration has launched a new U.S. effort to deepen military and economic ties with India as a way to balance China s assertive posture across Asia.   At the talks with Indian Foreign Minister Sushma Swaraj, both sides pledged to strengthen anti-terrorism cooperation and Tillerson said Washington stood ready to provide India with advanced military technology.   The United States supports India s emergence as a leading power and will continue to contribute to Indian capabilities to provide security throughout the region,  Tillerson told a joint news conference with Swaraj.  But the talks also touched on India s diplomatic ties with North Korea, Swaraj said, at a time when the United States has stepped up efforts to isolate Pyongyang over its nuclear and missile programs. Swaraj said she told the top U.S. diplomat that some level of diplomatic presence was necessary to keep open channels of communication.   As far as the question of embassy goes, our embassy there is very small, but there is in fact an embassy,  she said.  I told Secretary Tillerson that some of their friendly countries should maintain embassies there so that some channels of communication are kept open.  India and North Korea maintain diplomatic offices in each other s capitals, though New Delhi recently banned trade of most goods with the country, except food and medicine. Trade was minimal, Swaraj said. The focus on North Korea comes as U.S. President Donald Trump heads to China next month, where he is expected to urge President Xi Jinping to make good on his commitments to try to rein in North Korea. Tillerson, who flew in from Pakistan which he called an important U.S. ally in the restive region, also held talks with Prime Minister Narendra Modi who is driving closer ties with the United States. But India, a former leading light of the Non-Aligned Movement and which was on the opposite side of the United States during the Cold War, still remains wary of any alliances with major powers lest it affect its autonomy. India has also maintained ties with Iran which is being targeted by the Trump administration for its alleged military support of extremist groups in the Middle East and for its ballistic missile programme. India has long sourced its oil from Iran, but in recent years the two sides have been also collaborating on key infrastructure projects.  New Delhi is pushing hard for the development of Chabahar port on the Iranian coast as a hub for its trade links to the resource-rich countries of central Asia and Afghanistan but the Trump administration s tough stance has raised new concerns over the future of that project.   But Tillerson struck a conciliatory stance on India s ties with Iran, saying it wouldn t come in the way of countries doing legitimate business there.   It is not our objective to harm the Iranian people nor is it our objective to interfere with legitimate business activities that are going on with other businesses, whether they be from Europe, India or agreements that are in place or promote economic development and activity to the benefit of our friends and allies,  he said.  America s disagreements were with the Iranian regime, and in particular the Iran Revolutionary Guard, he said.  India is especially keen on the Chabahar port as a way to bypass long-time foe Pakistan which does not allow easy trade and transit arrangements to Afghanistan and beyond. Tillerson said the U.S. stood should-to-shoulder with India in the fight against terrorism which New Delhi has long said is centered in militant groups operating from inside Pakistan.  He said militant groups were a threat to everyone in the region, including Pakistan itself.  Quite frankly my view - and I expressed this to the leadership of Pakistan - is we also are concerned about the stability and security of Pakistan s government as well.  The United States has been urging Pakistan to act against the groups that operate in Afghanistan, India and inside Pakistan itself.  Terrorist safe havens will not be tolerated,  Tillerson said. Pakistan says it is doing all it can to fight the militants.  ',\n",
       " 'XIAMEN, China (Reuters) - Russian President Vladimir Putin said on Tuesday that any decision by the United States to supply defensive weapons to Ukraine would fuel the conflict in eastern Ukraine and possibly prompt pro-Russian separatists to expand their campaign there. On a visit to Kiev last month, U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said he was actively reviewing sending lethal weapons to Ukraine to help it defend itself, an option that previous U.S. president Barack Obama vetoed. Ukraine and Russia are at loggerheads over a war in eastern Ukraine between pro-Russian separatists and Ukrainian government forces that has killed more than 10,000 people in three years. Kiev accuses Moscow of sending troops and heavy weapons to the region, which Russia denies.  Putin, answering a question after a BRICS summit in China about the possibility of the United States supplying Ukraine with heavy weapons, said it was for Washington to decide whom it sold or gave weapons to, but he warned against the move, something Kiev wants.   The delivery of weapons to a conflict zone doesn t help peacekeeping efforts, but only worsens the situation,  Putin told a news briefing.  Such a decision would not change the situation but the number of casualties could increase.  In comments likely to be interpreted as a veiled threat, Putin suggested that pro-Russian separatists were likely to respond by expanding their own campaign.  The self-declared (pro-Russian) republics (in eastern Ukraine) have enough weapons, including ones captured from the other side  said Putin.  It s hard to imagine how the self-declared republics would respond. Perhaps they would deploy weapons to other conflict zones.  Putin also said Russia intended to draft a resolution for consideration in the United Nations Security Council, suggesting armed U.N. peacekeepers be deployed to eastern Ukraine to help protect ceasefire monitors from the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE) there.  It would help resolve the problem in eastern Ukraine,  said Putin, saying that a slew of preconditions would need to be met before any such deployment happened. ',\n",
       " '21st Century Wire says A tidal wave of revelations is pouring out of the Clinton campaign as the 2016 presidential election draws to a close.   MELTDOWN    The Clinton campaign continues to unravel following a series of troubling details. (Photo illustration 21WIRE)Over the weekend, it was discovered through a Wikileaks email dump, that Neera Tanden of the Center for American Progress, John Podesta s top aide, had an email exchange with Michael Lux of Progressive Strategies revealing that the Democratic consultant Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners, was closely allied with Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook.  POLITICAL BOMBSHELL    Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook had close ties to disgraced DNC consultant Robert Creamer. (Image Source: Lockerdome)Creamer gained national attention when he became the subject of video sting operation captured by the investigative non-profit Project Veritas. Not only was it revealed that the Creamer discussed ways to commit voter fraud and violence at Donald Trump rallies on camera   he also met with White House officials some 342 times over the past year, including 47 private meetings with President Obama or other senior officials.  DNC SCANDAL    Robert Creamer of Democracy Partners and Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky. (Image Source: National Vanguard)Creamer s visits to the White House also included his wife, a 9-term Illinois Democratic congresswoman Jan Schakowsky.White House visitor records have shown that Schakowsky took 47  private meetings with Obama or his senior staff, over the past year. The consultancy Democracy Partners appears to have applied Schakowsky as a political buffering point, in the event of a fallout over their operations at a grassroots level. The nature of this type of procedural separation is to keep certain high-ranking officials of the hook in case of a massive upheaval over various underhanded campaign tactics, potentially giving the Clinton campaign and the DNC plausible deniability.The Mook fallout is the latest in a laundry list of problems for the Clinton campaign and comes at a time when interim DNC chair Donna Brazile, is embroiled in controversy of over leaked debate questions prior to at least two 2016 town hall debates. Brazile stepped down from her role at CNN earlier in October. Here s a passage from the Daily Caller describing the scenario: Donna Brazile, the interim chair of the Democratic National Committee, began providing town hall and debate questions to the Clinton campaign earlier than previously known, emails released by WikiLeaks on Monday show. The article continued by stating that the revelations expose that the interim DNC chair was more deeply involved than previously outlined: In the March 12 exchange, Brazile mentions [Roland] Martin by name and offers to provide more than just the one town hall question that she is known to have shared with the campaign. I ll send a few more. Though some questions Roland submitted,  Brazile wrote to Palmieri in the March 12 email thread, which is entitled From time to time I get the questions in advance. Martin, is a commentator for TV One and the host of News One Now, as well as a CNN contributor.In another matter, the Wall Street Journal revealed the following, while disclosing an apparently contentious relationship between the FBI and DOJ, while the FBI appears to be somewhat fractured over the latest email server case developments: The latest development began in early October when New York-based FBI officials notified Andrew McCabe [of the Terry McAuliffe campaign contribution scandal], the bureau s second-in-command, that while investigating Mr. Weiner for possibly sending sexually charged messages to a teenage minor, they had recovered a laptop. Many of the 650,000 emails on the computer, they said, were from the accounts of Ms. Abedin, according to people familiar with the matter. Some critics have called for McCabe to recuse himself after it was revealed his wife received $675,000 from a well-known Clinton confidant, Terry McAuliffe. This was further underlined after the House Oversight Commitee wanted more information about the Senate campaign of Dr. Jill McCabe and its ties to the Clintons.The alleged internal feud among agencies was compounded when Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Deputy Attorney General Sally Yates objected  to FBI Director James Comey reopening the Clinton email server case this past week   something that added to the Lynch/Clinton tarmac meeting before the first FBI ruling in the Clinton case.According to a report filed by Zero Hedge, a close friend of Podesta, Peter Kadzik, the Assistant Attorney General of the Department of Justice (DOJ), will be in charge of a probe into Huma Abedin, Clintion s closest aide.Interestingly, as a mountain of controversy envelops the Clinton campaign, the FBI is now conducting an early inquiry into former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, over his alleged foreign business connections.Back in August, the following business connection was revealed by NBC news: In 2008, according to court records, senior Trump aide Paul Manafort s firm was involved with a Ukrainian oligarch named Dmytro Firtash in a plan to redevelop a famous New York hotel, the Drake. The total value of the project was $850 million. Firtash s company planned to invest over $100 million, the records say.That same year, Firtash acknowledged to the U.S. ambassador in Ukraine that he got his start in business with the permission of a notorious Russian crime lord, according to a classified State Department cable. Other cables say Firtash made part of his fortune through sweetheart natural gas deals between Russia and the Ukraine. Although the US State Department has determined that Firtash may have ties to a criminal enterprise in Russia   so far, there s nothing directly linking Manafort to any underground element at this time.Watch this space   as the Russia/Trump meme fostered by mainstream media or some other politically polarizing element will look to deflect from the Clinton campaign meltdown.More from LifeZette below   OUT OF CONTROL?

Polling firm MDA said that 3.4 percent of those surveyed thought the Temer government was doing a  great or good  job - down from 10.3 percent in MDA s last such poll in February. Temer took over a year ago from impeached leftist Dilma Rousseff and has said he does not care about popularity and only wants to push through an austerity package before his term ends in Jan. 2019. Yet his ability to do so has been hamstrung by charges of taking bribes, racketeering and obstruction of justice. The charges against Temer are based on the plea-bargain testimony of the owners of the world s largest meatpacker, JBS SA. They accuse Temer of taking bribes in return for political favors and of conspiring to buy the silence of a witness who could implicate the leader.  Temer has repeatedly denied any wrongdoing. The MDA poll was commissioned by the national transport lobby CNT and surveyed 2,002 people across Brazil from Sept. 13-16. The poll has a margin of error of 2.2 percentage points. ',\n",

       " 'Trump s appointment of Breitbart chief Steve Bannon, along with his decision to have at least two people at the top of his campaign who will let him run amok, has further frightened and infuriated Republicans to the point where they re finally seeing reality about the candidate they put at the top of their ticket. As the layers of their delusions continue to be peeled back, former Minnesota Rep. Vin Weber says: Look, we are in a terrible position. The Republican Party has made a mistake of historic proportion and when you do that, you find yourself in a place with no good solutions. Trump s idiocy has started to affect down-ticket races all across the country, particularly in the Senate. Senators in tight races saw their numbers drop considerably between August 3 and August 15. This is good news for Democrats, but the GOP s continued insistence that Trump will, ultimately, work for them is rapidly becoming a pipe dream.It s hard to feel sorry for them over that, though, because they re the ones who stuck themselves with a candidate who can t even run a cohesive campaign. In fact, Weber sees conniving manipulation in Trump s decision to have three people managing his campaign: We now have a CEO, a campaign chairman and a campaign manager. That tells me that no one is in charge of this campaign. Trump is playing these three people against each other. Indeed, since the campaign manager is still Paul Manafort, Trump could be playing him against the other two. When Manafort replaced Corey Lewandowski as campaign manager back in June, everyone saw it as a sign that Trump was ready to take on the mantle of campaigning for the general election. They expected a pivot, effected in part by Manafort.But he s not pivoting, and he won t. Manafort failed miserably there. Since Trump s strategy of alienation worked so well during the primaries, he can t see any reason at all to change: I am who I am. It s me. I don t want to change. Everyone talks about  oh are you gonna pivot?  I don t want to pivot. I mean you have to be you. If you start pivoting, you are not being honest with people. That s a laugh coming from the man who spreads lies as easily as people spread the common cold. It s even sillier coming from someone who s trailing so badly in the polls that he s reduced to tweeting the ones where he s only a couple of points behind Hillary.His campaign is quickly becoming the only Republican entity that s still mired in the delusion that he can win anything at all. Hell has frozen over: The GOP is starting to admit, outright, that they fucked themselves sideways with a rusty chainsaw in nominating Donald Trump for president.Featured image via Ralph Freso/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'North Carolina is facing even more backlash for their anti-LGBT law Monday after a popular adult film site has decided to block the entire state in protest.XHamster.com went offline in the state at 12:30 p.m. EST today, leaving thousands of fans without their favorite porn site. When residents of North Carolina go to the webpage they are greeted with a black screen that the site s spokesman, Mike Kulich, says will stay there until lawmakers repeal House Bill 2. In an interview with the Huffington Post, Kulich explains why the company decided to pull out (no pun intended) of the state: We have spent the last 50 years fighting for equality for everyone and these laws are discriminatory which XHamster.com does not tolerate. Judging by the stats of what you North Carolinians watch, we feel this punishment is a severe one. We will not standby and pump revenue into a system that promotes this type of garbage. We respect all sexualities and embrace them. He went on to say that even though lawmakers rammed a bill that discriminates against transsexuals through, the viewers of XHamster seem to be far less bigoted than Republicans would like them to be: Back in March, we had 400,000 hits for the term  Transsexual  from North Carolina alone,  he said.  People from that state searched  Gay  319,907 times. That is actually quite common in Southern Bible Belt states, believe it or not. Although many of the voters in these states proclaim that they love their holy book and do not believe gay people deserve the same rights as everyone else, in the privacy of their own homes they frequently watch gay and lesbian pornography. Earlier this year PornHub (another popular XXX site) released the most popular categories by state and the South overwhelmingly preferred lesbian porn:Hypocrisy run deep in the South, doesn t it?Kulich says the company plans to replace the black screen with petition to repeal HB2 in the near future: Hopefully, it will get as many signatures as the  transsexual  searches,  he said.XHamster is just the latest in an expanding list of companies and entertainers who are protesting the state s ignorant law. One thing is becoming very obvious: Bigotry does not pay.

John McCain, R-Ariz., to the Senate for the vote, after he was recently diagnosed with brain cancer is sure to put more pressure on nervous Republicans who have been opposed or reluctant to commit to support the Republican plan.John McCain:  I hope again we can rely on humility on our need to cooperate, on our dependence on each other, to learn how to trust each other again, and by so doing better serve the people who elected us. Stop listening to the bombastic loudmouths on the radio, television and the internet. To hell with them! Despite uncertainty, the administration is predicting victory. Vice President Mike Pence s top legislative affairs aide, Marc Short, stated Tuesday morning on Fox Business News that, whether [McCain] is the 50th or the 51st vote, we re excited to have him back.

       " 'Just a few years after Republicans shut down the government. Then came so close to defaulting on America s debts that the nation s credit rating was reduced. Then nominated a reality television star and serial liar as president. Then elected said reality television star and serial liar to actually be president even after a tape was released where he bragged about sexual assault. Republican Representative Tom Rooney had an epiphany: Maybe  maybe the Republican Party is a joke?It may seem obvious to some, but even Republicans themselves are starting to question whether or not the GOP has a single good idea in years.Rooney s epiphany came after he watched how his party botched a healthcare reform bill that the GOP had spent seven years promising to pass. From start to finish, the effort was a spectacular failure. The bill itself was a rush job and so poorly constructed that an independent assessment of its effects found that it would result in 24 million fewer people having insurance while also not saving the country any money. The bill s popularity hovered around 17%. Then the right-wing section of the Republican Party actually revolted against the bill because it didn t kick more people off of insurance. Then Trump demanded the GOP prove its loyalty to him by passing the bill anyway   and nobody listened. The bill failed before it even got a vote, humiliating both Trump and House Speaker Paul Ryan.Republicans, including Rooney, were shook. So much so that Rooney began saying the one thing you as a Republican are never supposed to say aloud.As the prospect of a loss became more real on Friday, the frustrations of GOP lawmakers loyal to the leadership began to boil over.  I ve been in this job eight years, and I m wracking my brain to think of one thing our party has done that s been something positive, that s been something other than stopping something else from happening,  Representative Tom Rooney of Florida said in an interview.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Democrat Hillary Clinton’s unexpected defeat in Michigan has laid bare growing voter anger over international trade, raising warning flags for her ahead of a possible presidential election showdown against Republican front-runner Donald Trump. Trump has built his campaign on pledges to scrap international trade deals and do more to protect American workers from foreign competition, tapping the same groundswell of discontent that propelled Clinton’s rival Bernie Sanders to victory in the Midwestern state on Tuesday. Clinton remains heavily favored to win the Democratic nomination. But the setback in Michigan could signal further troubles in upcoming primaries in other Rust Belt states such as Ohio, forcing her further to the left on economic issues and possibly influencing her choice for an eventual running mate, strategists said. The backlash against 20 years of trade liberalization has stalled the Trans Pacific Partnership (TPP), a sweeping Pacific trade deal backed by President Barack Obama and threatens to stymie the trade agenda for years to come. “It’s politically radioactive to support free trade right now,” said Greg Valliere, a Washington analyst for Horizon Investments, a financial firm. Clinton’s troubles with her party’s left wing — and with white, working class voters more generally — may steer her toward a trade skeptic such as Senator Sherrod Brown of Ohio as a vice presidential running mate, said Democratic strategist Steve Jarding. Political pundits had expected Clinton to pick someone to increase her appeal to Hispanic or other minority voters, such as U.S. Housing and Urban Development Julian Castro. Sanders, 74, is unlikely to end up as Clinton’s running mate, partly due to his age, Democrats said. Both Sanders, a democratic socialist, and billionaire Trump have harnessed anti-trade sentiment in their insurgent White House bids, criticizing deals like NAFTA as job killers that have depressed the living standards of working Americans. Exit polls from Michigan, a hub of the U.S. auto industry, show widespread voter skepticism on trade that may have helped Sanders and Trump win their respective party primaries.  “She made a fundamental mistake early on in this campaign to try to stay in the center,” Democratic strategist Steve Jarding said of Clinton. “This cycle, there is no center.” Sanders campaigned heavily against foreign trade in a state that has been hammered by overseas competition since the 1980s. Some 58 percent of his supporters in Michigan exit polls said that trade takes away U.S. jobs, while a slight majority - 53 percent - of Clinton backers said trade creates U.S. jobs. The Economic Policy Institute, a left-leaning think tank, estimates that Michigan would lose 5 percent of its jobs if TPP were to take effect, the highest proportion of any state. Gary Hunley, a substitute teacher in Dearborn, Michigan, said he believed Clinton was partially to blame for stagnant wages because NAFTA was enacted under her husband Bill Clinton’s presidency in the 1990s. “She was not a passive first lady,” Hunley said. Clinton’s stance on trade is more nuanced than Trump’s and Sanders’. After NAFTA was enacted, she voted against a free-trade deal with Central America while serving as a U.S. senator in the following decade. As Obama’s secretary of state, Clinton helped negotiate the TPP with Japan, Vietnam and other Pacific Rim countries.  As a presidential candidate, Clinton has said after reading the final language of the deal she would vote against it because it does not adequately protect U.S. workers.  Clinton campaign manager Robby Mook told reporters Wednesday there were no plans to adjust her stance and that he would “put Secretary Clinton up against any candidate in this race on trade,” including Trump.  Despite backing by the Obama administration, Republican lawmakers and many business groups, Republican leaders in Congress have shown no sign that they will bring TPP up for a  vote this year. The Obama administration says the deal has high labor and environmental standards that were not part of NAFTA. “I’m not sure that has fully been absorbed in the public mindset,” U.S. National Security Adviser Susan Rice told Reuters. [L1N16H1VJ] The deal may fare no better under the next president. Sanders and Trump oppose TPP, and Senator Ted Cruz, who is in second place in the Republican contest, has said he would not vote for it this year. “They’ve listened to the public and politicians have caught up with the public on this,” Brown, the Ohio Democratic senator, told Reuters. The evidence that the TPP would help the U.S. economy much is less than conclusive. The Peter G. Peterson Institute, a pro-trade think tank, estimates that it would boost economic growth by just 0.5 percent after 15 years. The deal would not boost employment overall, but would result in a “churn” of 53,700 jobs lost and created each year, and it would boost incomes by 0.5 percent, the institute found.  Another estimate by the Global Development and Environment Institute at Tufts University found the trade deal would slow growth by 0.54 percent after 10 years and cost 448,000 jobs in the United States.

Since the beginning of February, they were some of the best performing weeks in the history of the brand,  Abigail Klem, the president of the Ivanka Trump fashion brand, tells Refinery29 in an interview published Tuesday.  For several different retailers Ivanka Trump was a top performer online, and in some of the categories it was the [brand s] best performance ever. The news of a sales surge comes after Nordstrom announced in early February that it would no longer carry the 35-year-old s clothing and accessories, citing poor product sales. The move caused President Trump to tweet shortly after the announcement that his daughter was being  treated so unfairly  by the luxury department store giant.Also last month, Neiman Marcus stopped carrying the first daughter s jewelry line on its website, and employees of T.J.

The Office of Government Ethics recommended disciplinary action against White House adviser Kellyanne Conway after she urged viewers to  go buy Ivanka s stuff  during a February interview on  Fox & Friends.

       " 'BOGOTA (Reuters) - Colombia s next three governments must comply with a 2016 peace deal signed with the Marxist FARC rebel group, the Constitutional Court said in a ruling late on Wednesday, shielding the accord from potential changes should the opposition win next year s elections. The decision blocks modifications to the peace deal for the next 12, stymieing right-wing opponents of President Juan Manuel Santos who have long rejected the accord and who may have sought to change or cancel it. The deal with the Revolutionary Armed Forces of Colombia (FARC) rebels ended more than 52 years of war. More than 220,000 people have died and millions have been displaced during the Andean country s conflict between the government, leftist guerrillas and right-wing paramilitaries.  Institutions and authorities of the state have the obligation to comply with what is established in the final accord in good faith...until the end of three complete presidential periods following the signing,  reads the constitutional reform approved by the court. The government welcomed the ruling, with peace commissioner Rodrigo Rivera saying in a statement that the ruling should ease any worries among former FARC combatants, some 7,000 of whom have demobilized and formed a political party, that the accord will not be respected. Right-wing opposition politicians, including ex-president turned senator Alvaro Uribe, said the ruling ignored the will of Colombians, who narrowly rejected the deal in a referendum held just over a year ago, before it was modified and passed through Congress.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. State Department has approved arms sales packages worth more than $3.8 billion to Bahrain including F-16 jets, upgrades, missiles and patrol boats, the Pentagon said on Friday. The approvals coincide with the State Department s notification to Congress, which had held up a similar arms deal last year over human rights concerns.  The proposed sales include 19 F-16V jets made by Lockheed Martin Corp which could have a value of up to $2.7 billion, the Pentagon said.  Other potential sales approved Friday include two 35 meter (114 feet) patrol boats with machine guns, 221 anti-tank missiles made by Raytheon Co and $1.8 billion worth of upgrades to Bahrain s existing fleet of F-16 jets, the Pentagon said in separate statements. In May, U.S. President Donald Trump said Washington s relations with Bahrain would improve, after meeting with the king of the Gulf Arab state during a visit to Saudi Arabia. However in June, U.S. Senator Bob Corker, the chairman of the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, said he would block arms sales to members of the Gulf Cooperation Council, including Bahrain, until they made progress in resolving a simmering dispute with Qatar. But a U.S. official, who spoke on condition of anonymity earlier on Friday, said the proposed sales were cleared by the Senate Foreign Relations and House Foreign Affairs Committees through the regular  tiered review process  which precedes this formal notification. The U.S. official also said the United States has regular discussions with Bahrain on human rights and political reform and continues to urge its government to pursue efforts that will enhance regional security.

Some are saying this letter was written by Wayne Allen Root, however we can find no evidence to verify that Root wrote this letter either. We believe the letter has some outstanding points and should be read by every voter as they consider the candidate they will support for President in 2016.Here is the letter that was sent to 100% FED Up:What I see happening in a Trump Presidency:They will kill him before they let him be president. It could be a Republican or a Democrat that instigates the shutting up of Trump.Don t be surprised if Trump has an accident. Some people are getting very nervous: Barack Obama, Valerie Jarrett, Eric Holder, Hillary Clinton and Jon Corzine, to name just a few.It s about the unholy dynamics between big government, big business, and big media. They all benefit by the billions of dollars from this partnership, and it s in all of their interests to protect one another. It s one for all and all for one. It s a heck of a filthy relationship that makes everyone filthy rich, everyone except the American people. We get ripped off. We re the patsies. But for once, the powerful socialist cabal and the corrupt crony capitalists are scared. The over-the-top reaction to Trump by politicians of both parties, the media, and the biggest corporations of America has been so swift and insanely angry that it suggests they are all threatened and frightened.Donald Trump can self-fund. No matter how much they say to the contrary, the media, business, and political elite understand that Trump is no joke. He could actually win and upset their nice cozy apple cart.It s no coincidence that everyone has gotten together to destroy The Donald. It s because most of the other politicians are part of the a good old boys club. They talk big, but they won t change a thing. They are all beholden to big-money donors. They are all owned by lobbyists, unions, lawyers, gigantic environmental organizations, and multinational corporations   like Big Pharmacy or Big Oil. Or they are owned lock, stock, and barrel by foreigners like George Soros owns Obama or foreign governments own Hillary and their Clinton Foundation donations.These run-of-the-mill establishment politicians are all puppets owned by big money. But there s one man who isn t beholden to anyone. There s one man who doesn t need foreigners, or foreign governments, or George Soros, or the United Auto Workers, or the teacher s union, or the Service Employees International Union, or the Bar Association to fund his campaign.Billionaire tycoon and maverick Donald Trump doesn t need anyone s help. That means he doesn t care what the media says. He doesn t care what the corporate elites think. That makes him very dangerous to the entrenched interests. That makes Trump a huge threat to those people. Trump can ruin everything for the bribed politicians and their spoiled slave masters.Don t you ever wonder why the GOP has never tried to impeach Obama? Don t you wonder why John Boehner and Mitch McConnell talk a big game, but never actually try to stop Obama? Don t you wonder why Congress holds the purse strings, yet has never tried to de-fund Obamacare or Obama s clearly illegal executive action on amnesty for illegal aliens? Bizarre, right? It defies logic, right?First, I d guess many key Republicans are being bribed. Secondly, I believe many key Republicans are being blackmailed. Whether they are having affairs, or secretly gay, or stealing taxpayer money, the National Security Agency knows everything.Ask former House Speaker Dennis Hastert about that. The government even knew he was withdrawing large sums of his own money from his own bank account. The NSA, the SEC, the IRS, and all the other three-letter government agencies are watching every Republican political leader. They surveil everything. Thirdly, many Republicans are petrified of being called racists, so they are scared to ever criticize Obama or call out his crimes, let alone demand his impeachment. Fourth , why rock the boat? After defeat or retirement, if you re a good old boy, you ve got a $5 million-per-year lobbying job waiting. The big-money interests have the system gamed. Win or lose, they win.But Trump doesn t play by any of these rules. Trump breaks up this nice, cozy relationship between big government, big media, and big business. All the rules are out the window if Trump wins the Presidency. The other politicians will protect Obama and his aides but not Trump. Remember: Trump is the guy who publicly questioned Obama s birth certificate. He questioned Obama s college records and how a mediocre student got into an Ivy League university. Now, he s doing something no Republican has the chutzpah to do. He s questioning our relationship with Mexico; he s questioning why the border is wide open; he s questioning why no wall has been built across the border; he s questioning if allowing millions of illegal aliens into America is in our best interests; he s questioning why so many illegal aliens commit violent crimes, yet are not deported; and he s questioning why our trade deals with Mexico, Russia and China are so bad.Trump has the audacity to ask out loud why American workers always get the short end of the stick. Good question! I m certain Trump will question what happened to the almost billion dollars given in a rigged no-bid contract to college friends of Michelle Obama at foreign companies to build the defective Obamacare website. By the way, that tab is now up to $5 billion. Trump will ask if Obamacare s architects can be charged with fraud for selling it by lying. Trump will investigate Obama s widespread IRS conspiracy, not to mention Obama s college records. Trump will prosecute Clinton and Obama for fraud committed to cover up Benghazi before the election. How about the fraud committed by employees of the Labor Department when they made up dramatic job numbers in the last jobs report before the 2012 election?Obama, the multinational corporations and the media need to stop Trump. They recognize this could get out of control. If left unchecked, telling the raw truth and asking questions everyone else is afraid to ask, Trump could wake a sleeping giant. Trump s election would be a nightmare. Obama has committed many crimes. No one else but Trump would dare to prosecute. He will not hesitate. Once Trump gets in and gets a look at the cooked books and Obama s records, the game is over. The goose is cooked. Holder could wind up in prison. Jarrett could wind up in prison. Obama bundler Corzine could wind up in prison for losing $1.5 billion of customer money. Clinton could wind up in jail for deleting 32,000 emails or for accepting bribes from foreign governments while Secretary of State, or for misplacing $6 billion as the head of the State Department, or for lying about Benghazi. The entire upper level management of the IRS could wind up in prison.Obamacare will be de-funded and dismantled. Obama himself could wind up ruined, his legacy in tatters. Trump will investigate. Trump will prosecute. Trump will go after everyone involved. That s why the dogs of hell have been unleashed on Donald Trump.Yes, it s become open season on Donald Trump. The left and the right are determined to attack his policies, harm his businesses, and, if possible, even keep him out of the coming debates. But they can t silence him. And they sure can t intimidate him. The more they try, the more the public will realize that he s the one telling the truth .',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - President-elect Donald Trump will nominate Republican U.S. Representative Mick Mulvaney to be director of the White House Office of Management and Budget, a senior transition official said on Friday. The following is a list of Republican Trump’s selections for top jobs in his administration; all the posts but those of national security adviser, the White House chief of staff, White House director of the National Economic Council and White House strategist require Senate confirmation: Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump’s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. Son of a country store owner, the Alabama senator and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  U.S. Representative Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government’s sweeping collection of Americans’ communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran.     Ross, 79, heads the private equity firm W.L. Ross & Co. His net worth was pegged by Forbes at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump and an economic adviser, Ross helped shape the Trump campaign’s views on trade policy. He blames the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which went into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization, for causing massive U.S. factory job losses.     Mattis is a retired Marine general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname “Mad Dog.” He was once rebuked for saying in 2005: “It’s fun to shoot some people.” DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for the expansion of charter schools. Perry, 66, adds to the list of oil drilling advocates skeptical about climate change who have been picked for senior positions in Trump’s Cabinet. The selections have worried environmentalists but cheered an oil and gas industry eager for expansion. Perry, who also briefly ran in the 2016 presidential race, would have to be confirmed by the Senate to head the Energy Department, which is responsible for U.S. energy policy and oversees the nation’s nuclear weapons program.  ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ADMINISTRATOR: SCOTT PRUITT An ardent opponent of President Barack Obama’s measures to stem climate change, Oklahoma Attorney General Pruitt, 48, has enraged environmental activists. But he fits with the president-elect’s promise to cut the agency back and eliminate regulation that he says is stifling oil and gas drilling. Pruitt became the top state prosecutor for Oklahoma, which has extensive oil reserves, in 2011, and has challenged the EPA multiple times since. U.S. Representative Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion. The final leadership role of Kelly’s 45-year career was head of the U.S. Southern Command, responsible for U.S. military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean. The 66-year-old retired Marine general differed with Obama on key issues and has warned of vulnerabilities along the United States’ southern border with Mexico. Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson previously indicated reluctance to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. Carson is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump. Zinke, 55, a first-term Republican representative and a member of the House subcommittee on natural resources, has voted for legislation that would weaken environmental safeguards on public lands. He has taken stances favoring coal, a fossil fuel that suffered during the Obama administration. The League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave Zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent. Puzder, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc, which runs the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s fast-food chains, has been a vociferous critic of government regulation of the workplace and the National Labor Relations Board. Puzder, 66, has argued that higher minimum wages would hurt workers by forcing restaurants to close, and praises the benefits of automation, so his appointment is likely to antagonize organized labor.  Cohn, 56, president and chief operating officer of investment bank Goldman Sachs, had widely been considered heir apparent to Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of the Wall Street firm. Trump hammered Goldman and Blankfein during the presidential campaign, releasing a television ad that called Blankfein part of a “global power structure” that had robbed America’s working class. Retired Lieutenant General Flynn, 57, was an early Trump supporter and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his Army career in 1981 and was deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama’s foreign policy. U.S. Representative Mick Mulvaney, 49, a South Carolina Republican, is a fiscal conservative. He was an outspoken critic of former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus. Mulvaney was first elected to Congress in 2010. Tillerson, 64, has spent his entire career at Exxon Mobil Corp, where he rose to serve as its chairman and CEO in 2006. A civil engineer by training, the Texan joined the world’s largest energy company in 1975 and led several of its operations in the United States as well as in Yemen, Thailand and Russia. As Exxon’s chief executive, he maintained close ties with Moscow and opposed U.S. sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Crimea. McMahon, 68, is a co-founder and former chief executive of the professional wrestling franchise WWE, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut. She ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for a U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012, and was an early supporter of Trump’s presidential campaign. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. She is a director at Ingersoll Rand, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Company. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. Mnuchin, 53, is a successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California’s largest bank. Housing advocacy groups criticized the bank for its foreclosure practices, accusing it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Haley, 44, has been the Republican governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, she led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. Recently re-elected to serve as Republican National Committee chairman, Priebus will give up his party post to join Trump in the White House, where the low-key Washington operative could help forge ties with Congress to advance Trump’s agenda. The 44-year-old was a steadfast supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign even as the party fractured amid the choice. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST, SENIOR COUNSELOR: STEVE BANNON The former head of the conservative website Breitbart News came aboard as Trump’s campaign chairman in August. A rabble-rousing conservative media figure, he helped shift Breitbart into a forum for the alt-right, a loose confederation of those who reject mainstream politics and includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. His hiring signals Trump’s dedication to operating outside the norms of Washington. As White House chief of staff, Bannon, 63, will serve as Trump’s gatekeeper and agenda-setter. ',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - French President Emmanuel Macron said on Wednesday the Iran nuclear deal was not enough given that Tehran had increased its influence in the region and pressed ahead with ballistic missile tests, and offered to mediate between the United States and Iran. Macron, whose country had been one of the toughest negotiators during the talks between Britain, China, Germany Russia, United States and Iran, repeated that it would be an error to scrap the deal.   Is this agreement enough? No. It is not, given the evolution of the regional situation and increasing pressure that Iran is exerting on the region, and given increased activity by Iran on the ballistic level since the accord,  Macron told reporters in New York. Macron said he wanted to discuss possible sanctions over Iran s ballistic missile program, open negotiations immediately on what happens after the limitations to the accord begin to be lifted in 2025 and hold a discussion on the role of Iran in the region.   Let s be honest, the tensions are on the rise, look at the activities of Hezbollah and Iran s pressure on Syria. We need a clear framework to be able to reassure regional countries and the United States,  Macron said, adding that he was ready to mediate between the United States and Iran. Macron said he had not given up on convincing U.S. President Donald Trump, who has called the deal  the worst ever , to change his mind.  The French leader said he believed he had managed to at least convince Trump to allow France and the United Nations to play a mediation role between Tehran and Washington with regard to the situation in Syria, where Iran is a core backer of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad.  I proposed that we initiate the work of a contact group at P5 level (Britain, China, Germany, France, Russia), which has been done and we will widen it to represent the political forces in Syria and the regional powers without Iran,  Macron said.  The United Nations Secretary General and France will play the role of mediator for Iran so that we have a parallel negotiation, but that will enable us to include Iran in the process,  he said. The foreign ministers of the P5 will meet to discuss the group Thursday morning at the U.N., where leaders are gathered for the world body s annual general assembly. The last major international attempt to resolve the crisis ended in failure when the International Syria Support Group (ISSG), which included Iran, was cast aside after Syrian government forces retook the rebel stronghold of Aleppo in 2016. Russia, Turkey and Iran have been negotiating separately for months in Astana to try to reduce the violence on the ground by creating de-escalation zones across the country, although those talks do not cover a long-term political solution. The idea of the French initiative would be to revive U.N.-brokered peace talks in Geneva and press ahead with implementation of an existing U.N. roadmap.   The process in Geneva has stopped and there is only the Astana process which will lead to tensions between the participants because it is a process that is a mechanical partition of Syria,  Macron said.

       " '(Reuters) - The U.S. tax overhaul as currently proposed will make housing less affordable, according to nearly half of the property market experts polled by Reuters, with another third saying it would not do anything to improve it. A decade on from the start of the crash that knocked more than a third off U.S. home values and led to a deep global recession, the housing market has bounced back smartly. U.S. house prices are expected to rise next year and in 2019, faster than predicted just a few months ago and at more than double the rate of underlying consumer inflation and wages. That is in sharp contrast to the outlook for Britain. [GB/HOMES] The S&P/Case Shiller composite index of U.S. home prices in 20 metropolitan areas is expected to gain 5.1 percent next year and 4.2 percent in 2019. The main challenge currently is a chronic shortage of homes, which is pushing prices beyond the reach of new buyers, who tend to be young and not particularly well-paid and, if university-educated, already saddled with huge amounts of debt. Now adding to those concerns is an effort by President Donald Trump’s administration to overhaul the tax code, which analysts say could undermine any potential improvements in affordability in the housing market. The Republican tax proposal allows interest payment deductions on mortgage debt up to $750,000, down from the current $1 million. The House of Representatives is scheduled to vote on the tax bill on Tuesday afternoon, and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said his chamber would vote on Tuesday evening. Twelve of 26 analysts who answered an extra question said the tax bill in its current form will probably make housing more expensive. Eight respondents said it would do nothing and only six expected it would improve affordability. “Losing the tax deduction of mortgage payments and property taxes - of having deductibility limited - makes housing less attractive and less affordable,” said Robert Brusca, chief economist at FAO Economics. But he added: “The Trump/Congress plan is such a not-well-thought-out-mess it’s hard to tell how it will impact people in a systematic way.” Asked to rate affordability on a scale of 1 being the cheapest and 10 the most expensive, the median answer was 6. While the latest consensus on U.S. housing affordability has not changed in more than a year of polling, the range of forecasts has narrowed. “We think there’s a possibility that if the tax bill is successful in generating economic growth, housing affordability could take a turn for the worse,” noted Ralph McLaughlin, economist at Trulia in San Francisco.  “This is because the housing market has a supply, not a demand problem, so any policies that generate growth without boosting supply could make homes even more expensive than they already are.” Another challenge has been lingering for years. While the unemployment rate has plunged to a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, annual wage growth has not broken above 2.9 percent since the Great Recession that ended about eight years ago. “Home prices have been appreciating circa 5-6 percent well above wage growth at 2-2.5 percent, decreasing affordability for the average buyer, particularly first-time homebuyers strapped with student loan debt and facing still modest labor market opportunities,” said Lindsey Piegza, chief economist at Stifel in Chicago. She also pointed out that eliminating mortgage interest rate deductions will make housing less affordable.  The latest housing market data indicates that turnover is still far from the overheating boom rates from before the financial crisis. Existing home sales rose to a seasonally-adjusted annualized rate of 5.48 million units in October, but well below the peak above 7 million units in 2005.  Property analysts now forecast annualized existing home sales in each quarter next year to average 5.5-5.6 million, less than the 5.70-million-unit pace hit in March, which was the highest since February 2007.  Those latest projections were also weaker than expected in a Reuters poll in August. But data on Monday showed U.S. single-family homebuilding and permits rose in November to a level not seen since August 2007 and confidence among homebuilders soaring to near an 18-1/2-year high in December, in a hopeful sign for a housing market that has been struggling with supply constraints. The U.S. Federal Reserve expects to raise interest rates three times next year. While lifting short-term rates won’t necessarily push up longer-term market rates, the path of least resistance is higher. Still, the latest Reuters consensus for mortgage rates was lower than what was forecast in the previous survey in August. The 30-year mortgage rate is expected to average 4.24 percent next year, rising to 4.65 percent in 2019 and 5.00 percent in 2020. Analysts were evenly split in the poll on whether a faster pace of rate hikes from the Fed would significantly slow activity.  “If there are more than three hikes, it is likely that the Fed would be responding to stronger economic growth pushing inflation up – and that stronger growth would offset the rise in rates,” said David Berson, chief economist at Nationwide Insurance in Columbus, Ohio.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican party lawmakers warned on Friday that President Donald Trump’s legislative deal with Democrats to help hurricane victims and keep the government running for another three months could complicate his next big priority - tax reform. Trump’s sudden shift in strategy hands a clear victory to Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer and House Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi and that could slow the Republicans’ legislative agenda, they said. “This kind of creates complications relative to tax reform,” said Representative Ryan Costello from Pennsylvania. “It seems to me that there’s an element of unpredictability from one issue to the next and this week is sort of a reflection of that.”  “There was a lot of work going into how this was going to take shape in September. And that was entirely undermined … seemingly very spontaneously.” Following Trump’s deal with Democratic leaders, the House of Representatives on Friday approved legislation that provides $15.25 billion in emergency disaster aid for the victims of Hurricane Harvey, which battered coastal areas of Texas and Louisiana last week, and Hurricane Irma, which is expected to pound Florida in coming days. Already approved by the Senate on Thursday, the deal also raises the U.S. government’s debt ceiling and allows it to continue financing federal spending programs until Dec. 8, the new deadline for a deal on both issues. But some Republicans fear the Democrats will be able to use their negotiating clout in early December to resist changes on key tax issues, especially the corporate tax rate, which     Trump wants to cut from 35 percent to 15 percent. Republican Senator Ben Sasse said the experience of watching Trump empower Democrats had been “embarrassing” for a Republican-controlled Congress and that the deal made Schumer “the most powerful man in America.” Sasse was one of 17 Senate Republicans who voted against the deal on Thursday. In the House, all 90 “no” votes came from Republicans but the deal passed comfortably with 183 Democrats and 133 Republicans in favor.  The White House said Trump’s shift in strategy this week clears away complicated issues like the debt ceiling and government funding, both of which had to be resolved in September, so Congress can concentrate more fully on tax reform, which Republicans want to complete by the end of the year.  After the failure of Republican efforts to overturn former President Barack Obama’s Affordable Care Act in July, Trump and lawmakers need a legislative victory to shore up their hopes of maintaining Republican majorities in next year’s midterm elections.  Some House Republicans are already frustrated by a lack of details on tax reform from the administration. They hope to see  more as soon as next week, though some are skeptical. “My expectations are low. I think if they had something big they’d be floating elements of it now,” said Representative Darrell Issa.  How House Republicans respond to the tax plan will help determine the challenges they may face passing a fiscal year 2018 budget resolution that is critical to the Republican strategy for tax reform.  The budget contains a procedural rule that would allow Republicans to enact tax legislation with a simple majority in the Senate, which they control by a 52-48 margin. Republican aides said House leaders had expected to bring the budget to the floor next week, but the document now needs changes to include government revenue projections that take into account current tax policy and the failure to repeal Obamacare,  aides say. Members of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, a formidable bloc in the House, have said they will not support the budget until they see the tax reform plan and want the resolution to contain more cuts to federal spending than the $203 billion over a decade that it already contains.   It was not clear whether the budget resolution could now suffer from conservative anger over Friday’s vote. Many conservatives have long called for lawmakers to couple any measures that raise the U.S. debt ceiling with reforms to cut spending. The deal that passed on Friday did the opposite by attaching an increase in the debt ceiling to more spending to keep the government open, as well as adding money for hurricane relief without making any spending cuts elsewhere. “I love President Trump and I’m with him probably 90 or 95 percent of the time. But I don’t think it’s appropriate to raise the debt ceiling with a $19 trillion public debt and not have any effort to change the way we spend money here in Washington,” said Joe Barton, a House Freedom Caucus member. Mark Meadows, who chairs the House Freedom Caucus, said he did not feel betrayed by Trump and that the legislation was a “unique situation” brought about by the massive storm damage in Texas and Louisiana. “Because of hurricane relief, there wasn’t a whole lot of options,” Meadows said on MSNBC.  But, he added: “Our grassroots are very confused.”     ',\n",
       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - A Hezbollah-run media unit said on Friday Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi was reported to have been in the Syrian town of Albu Kamal during the Syrian army and its allies  operation to clear it. The military unit did not say what had happened to Baghdadi, give further details or identify its sources. The U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State said on Friday it had no  releasable information  on Baghdadi s whereabouts.  Syria s army declared victory over Islamic State on Thursday, saying its capture of the jihadists  last town in the country marked the collapse of their three-year rule in the region. But the army and its allies are still fighting Islamic State in desert areas close to Albu Kamal near the border with Iraq, the Syrian army said on Thursday. On Friday, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said  Islamic State has taken back control of half of Albu Kamal. The capture of the border town had sealed  the fall of the terrorist Daesh organization s project in the region , an army statement said on Thursday, using the Arabic acronym for Islamic State. An audio message purported to be from Baghdadi was released in September. Baghdadi declared himself caliph and heir to Islam s historic leaders from the great medieval mosque in Iraq s Mosul in 2014.

       " \"New York Times conservative columnist David Brooks is absolutely amazing. After years of sitting by while Republicans waged a scorched earth campaign against Democrats, the Constitution and basic human decency, he suddenly laments the toxic level of discourse in America. Why? Because Democrats are ascendant and Republicans are teetering on total collapse. Now, he says, we should work together and it would be bad for America if we don t!Brooks sets the stage by describing how we got here. He calls it  anti-politics  and he s VERY upset about it: Over the past generation we have seen the rise of a group of people who are against politics. These groups   best exemplified by the Tea Party but not exclusive to the right   want to elect people who have no political experience. They want  outsiders.  They delegitimize compromise and deal-making. They re willing to trample the customs and rules that give legitimacy to legislative decision-making if it helps them gain power. I m guessing he s referring to Bernie Sanders  supporters as being the left-wing version because I can t think of any other group on the left that even remotely fits the description. But Bernie has been in Washington for 30 something years. He s hardly an inexperienced outsider. His followers may like his rebel cred but they don t want him to get into office for the sole purpose of bringing the government to a grinding halt. This is Brooks creating a false equivalency in order to absolve himself of his responsibility in creating antipolitics.He goes on to describe the antipolitics people as being extremists that cannot compromise and increasingly damage the process of governing. Essentially what the GOP has been doing for years while Brooks gave them ideological cover to wreck the country. Brooks is especially put off by Trump despite having enabled his rise in the first place.So far, the column is the usual right wing shifting of blame. They are patently incapable of accepting responsibility for their actions. But then we get to this, the plaintive wail for sanity: The answer to Trump is politics. It s acknowledging other people exist. It s taking pleasure in that difference and hammering out workable arrangements. As Harold Laski put it, We shall make the basis of our state consent to disagreement. Therein shall we ensure its deepest harmony.' It sure does sound reasonable but the timing of this sudden epiphany is not coincidental. You see, Republicans have spent the last 30+ years polarizing the country to the point where the two sides cannot work together. While Republicans controlled the White House, both chambers of Congress AND the Supreme Court, this was exactly what they wanted. They spent 6 years of ignoring the Democrats and doing whatever they wanted. Then they spent all of Obama s presidency breaking the system so they could stop his agenda. They became the party of antipolitics.But in November, Republicans are going to be crushed at the ballot box. Trump is going to going to lose so badly, he s going to cost Republicans the Senate by a comfortable margin, not a small number of House seats, a few governorships and control of several state legislatures. Oh, and the Supreme Court is going to tilt left for the next 30 years, which will put the final nail in the coffin of the Republican voter suppression schemes that are the only thing keeping Republicans in power in many parts of the country.So after decades of  I hate you! I hope you die! Burn in hell! Compromise is surrender! Burn it all down unless we get 100% of what we want! , we should stop playing by their rules of winner takes all? Now that they re on the edge of losing everything, Republicans want to play nice again? Noooooope, fuck that. Republicans don t get to kick sand in our faces and then demand we share our ice cream because they dropped theirs.So sorry, Mr. Brooks. You had your chance and you blew it. You sat by and let your party turn American politics into a polarized blood sport. It s not our fault you lost and we re in no mood to give you the time of day much less any concessions. We re going to put you in a little box and undo all of the damage your policies have wrought since the 80s. Unions are going to grow in strength again. The minimum wage will become a living wage. Workers will have their rights restored. Women will have their rights restored. So will minorities and the victims of the Drug War (most of whom are minorities anyway). Wall Street will still make billions but they won t be able to crash the economy again. All of your voter suppression laws will be repealed and extreme gerrymandering will end. All of this will happen without no input from you because you have painted yourselves into a corner where working with a Democrat is grounds for being primaried from the far right. It won t happen in 4 years. Or even 8. Decades of damage will take decades to clean up. But it s going to happen and there s nothing you can do to stop it.Karl Rove once boasted of a  permanent Republican majority  in which Democrats would be utterly powerless. While I m not so bold as to claim a permanent Democratic majority, Republicans will grow weaker and weaker until they can stop appealing only to white racists. In the meantime, we re gonna take it all while you, Mr. Brooks, sit and scream in impotent rage at how mean and unfair the left has become. Ha. Ha. Ha. Fuck you.Featured image via diginpix.ina.fr\",\n",

       " '21st Century Wire says This week a US presidential executive order temporarily restricted travelers and refugees from Syria, Iraq, Iran, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, and Yemen from entering America. In response to the controversial order, a wave of anti-Trump  flash mob  protests emerged seemingly out of nowhere at New York s JFK Airport and other airports across the nation. Welcome to the brave new world of digital activism, driven by some of the world wealthiest men   ENGINEERING CRISIS    George Soros tied to protests over Trump s recent executive order concerning immigration.  (Photo illustration 21WIRE s Shawn Helton)While the airport angst appeared to be an organic effort to reject Trump s executive order on immigration, it was revealed that the heavily organized protests were found to be tied to social movement billionaire financier George Soros. Participating groups included the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), the National Immigration Law Center, the Urban Jusric Center, and  Make The Road  advocacy group, to name only a few   are all funded by Soros front organizations led by his Open Society Foundation.The airport protests erupted just a week after a string of multi-million dollar Soros-linked/Democratic Party-affiliated NGO s organized what was dubbed a  Women s March on Washington DC. The Soros-backed women s march  was full of Hollywood celebrities in addition to a bevy of other speakers that included Planned Parenthood president Cecile Richards, activist Gloria Steinem, filmmaker Michael Moore, as well as the convicted felon Donna Hylton, who took part in kidnapping and torturing a 62-year-old real-estate broker named Thomas Vigliarole, in a botched ransom plot from 1985.The recent airport protests and mainstream media reportage regarding the immigration based executive order prompted a response from President Donald Trump over the past 24 hours:Below will take a closer look at the main outline of the immigration based executive order, as another wave of Soros-backed political opposition has been triggered into action  (Image Source: abcnews.com)Here are the key provisions of the immigration order outlined by the Trump administration:Whether or not someone supports the new US immigration order, it is strange that the list does not include other countries linked to state-sponsored terror such as Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Qatar and Pakistan. From a security standpoint, by leaving out these terrorist-linked and terrorist sponsor countries   Trump s executive order makes little sense.In a press release from February of 2016, The Department of Homeland Security (DHS) outlined travel orders similar to Trump s immigration EO based on the Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015. Here s a passage of the DHS release discussing travel restrictions concerning the exact countries included in the Trump order: The Department of Homeland Security today announced that it is continuing its implementation of the Visa Waiver Program Improvement and Terrorist Travel Prevention Act of 2015 with the addition of Libya, Somalia, and Yemen as three countries of concern, limiting Visa Waiver Program travel for certain individuals who have traveled to these countries. Pursuant to the Act, the Secretary of Homeland Security had sixty days to determine whether additional countries or areas of concern should be subject to the travel or dual nationality restrictions under the Act. After careful consideration, and in consultation with the Director of National Intelligence and the Secretary of State, the Secretary of Homeland Security has determined that Libya, Somalia, and Yemen be included as countries of concern, specifically for individuals who have traveled to these countries since March 1, 2011. At this time, the restriction on Visa Waiver Program travel will not apply to dual nationals of these three countries. DHS continues to consult with the Department of State and the Office of the Director of National Intelligence to develop further criteria to determine whether other countries would be added to this list. Last month, the United States began implementing changes under the Act. The three additional countries designated today join Iran, Iraq, Sudan and Syria as countries subject to restrictions for Visa Waiver Program travel for certain individuals. Under the new law, the Secretary of Homeland Security may waive these restrictions if he determines that such a waiver is in the law enforcement or national security interests of the United States. Such waivers will be granted only on a case-by-case basis. As a general matter, categories of travelers who may be eligible for a waiver include individuals who traveled to these countries on behalf of international organizations, regional organizations, and sub-national governments on official duty; on behalf of a humanitarian NGO on official duty; or as a journalist for reporting purposes. Additionally, under the Obama administration, during the Syrian refugee resettlement program US entrance for Iraqi refugees was halted for 6 months in 2011.Interestingly, several Soros-linked organizations led the charge following the detention of immigrant travelers at airports in America over this past weekend. The ACLU, and the immigration-advocacy group Make The Road, both Soros linked entities, were heavily involved in organizing political opposition concerning the Trump immigration order.In 2014, it was disclosed that George Soros s Open Society Foundations granted $50 million dollars to the ACLU. Additionally, a law suit filed by ACLU associated lawyers and The National Immigration Law Center led to a stay of President Trump s executive orders over the past 48 hours.Breitbart recently reported that the  The National Immigration Law Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support. RT reported the following on January 30th: Three more federal judges, along with a district judge, have issued rulings barring authorities from deporting people detained at US airports following President Donald Trump s executive order restricting entry to travelers from seven countries with Muslim-majorities. Whether in the flesh, social media or through mainstream TV, the populace is subject to various forms of hyperreal propaganda around the global   in many ways this is being used to push certain political regime changes and party objectives through the use of deceptive color revolutions and their many incarnations.In a book from 2011 written by Susanne Elizabeth Shawyer entitled  Radical Street Theatre and the Yippie Legacy: A Performance History of the Youth International Party, 1967 1968,  we gain a clearer perspective of the term  Smart Mobs   and the nature of these cross-platform gatherings: The potential for ideological uses of flash mobs soon became clear by autumn 2003. Because of its original apolitical nature and network organization, the flash mob was easily appropriated for other means beyond random fun. Flash mobs were soon used for political or commercial end by those seeking to capitalize on the trendy cultural capital of flash mobs. Adding to that, Shawyer cites author social science critic Howard Rheingold, who penned a book entitled  Smart Mobs: The Next Social Revolution  in 2003 and continued to outline the nature of smart mobs: A smart mob may be composed of strangers who have no relationship to each other beyond their mutual connection to the network, yet this connection creates a virtual community and provides the opportunity for collective action. When looking at the smart mob phenomena concerning the recent anti-trump protests in America, we can see how a large block of people can become useful in spreading political or cultural memes.In addition, the blending of socially engineered political agitator mobs and color revolutions is becoming more and more imperceptible as any group-think meme can cause a sudden flash gathering for the cause of the day.Controversial filmmaker Michael Moore took to social media to rouse the masses, while acknowledging that the Soros-backed NGO MoveOn.org mobilized a protest directly outside of the White House . Debra Heine PJ MediaThe flurry of anguished news stories and protests surrounding President Trump s executive action temporarily suspending  immigrants and non-immigrants  from  countries of particular concern  appears to be part of a coordinated PR effort financed by left-wing billionaire George Soros.Rather than a complete  Muslim ban  as promised during the campaign, Trump s executive order contains moderate refugee restrictions, similar to those that have been implemented by President Obama. If reports are true that restrictions are being applied even to green-card holders, that is an unfortunate misapplication of the law that will likely soon be corrected.Protesters quickly materialized Saturday at JFK Airport, where some refugees were being temporarily detained.Who are these people? Make the Road  is a NY-based far-left non-profit funded in part by George Soros.According to Breitbart s Aaron Klein, the signatories to the lawsuit filed Saturday to block Trump s executive order included immigration lawyers from groups financed by Soros.At least one case quickly prompted a legal challenge as lawyers representing two Iraqi refugees held at Kennedy International Airport in New York filed a motion early Saturday seeking to have their clients released. They also filed a motion for class certification, in an effort to represent all refugees and other immigrants who they said were being unlawfully detained at ports of entry.The suit was filed by lawyers from the International Refugee Assistance Project, the National Immigration Law Center, the Jerome N. Frank Legal Services Organization at Yale Law School, the American Civil Liberties Union (ACLU), and the International Refugee Assistance Project (formerly Iraqi Refugee Assistance Project) at the Urban Justice Center.The ACLU is massively funded by Soros s Open Society Foundations, including with a $50 million grant in 2014.The National Immigration Law Center has received numerous Open Society grants earmarked for general support.The Urban Justice Center is also the recipient of an Open Society grant.Taryn Higashi, executive director of the Center s International Refugee Assistance Project, which is listed on the Trump lawsuit, currently serves on the Advisory Board of the International Migration Initiative of Soros s Open Society Foundations.Reportedly, open-borders advocate Soros has provided some $76 million for immigrant issues over the past decade, as Soros-funded immigrant rights groups  helped influence President Obama s immigration policy.PJ Media continues here..READ MORE TRUMP NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire Trump FilesSUPPORT 21WIRE   SUBSCRIBE & BECOME A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV',\n",
       " 'Hollywood producer kingpin and mega-Democrat Party donor, Harvey Weinstein s abusive sexual predator behavior has shined a light on all of Hollywood, and in the process has shined an even brighter light on the hypocrisy of the Democrat Party and their media allies. The leftist media is now being forced to discuss how Democrats have turned a blind eye to decades of criminal sexual assaults by Bill Clinton and given a pass to his wife Hillary, who enabled him by threatening his victims to remain silent.Four days ago, the hard-left MSNBC host Chris Hayes made a stunning admission about the hypocrisy of the Democrat Party, and how they are  long overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against Bill Clinton that have been swept under the carpet, while the victims were shamed.As gross and cynical and hypocrtical as the right\\'s \"what about Bill Clinton\" stuff is, it\\'s also true that Democrats and the center left are overdue for a real reckoning with the allegations against him.  Chris Hayes (@chrislhayes) November 10, 2017Yesterday, The Atlantic came out with a damning article that blames the fake feminism movement on the left, as well as the Democrat Party, who has allowed a double standard to exist when it comes to blindly protecting and defending the Clinton s against any, and all sexual misconduct allegations.Yet let us not forget the sex crimes of which the younger, stronger Bill Clinton was very credibly accused in the 1990s. Juanita Broaddrick reported that when she was a volunteer on one of his gubernatorial campaigns, she had arranged to meet him in a hotel coffee shop. At the last minute, he had changed the location to her room in the hotel, where she says he very violently raped her. She said that she fought against Clinton throughout a rape that left her bloodied. At a different Arkansas hotel, he caught sight of a minor state employee named Paula Jones, and, Jones said, he sent a couple of state troopers to invite her to his suite, where he exposed his penis to her and told her to kiss it. Kathleen Willey said that she met him in the Oval Office for personal and professional advice and that he groped her, rubbed his erect penis on her, and pushed her hand to his crotch.It was a pattern of behavior; it included an alleged violent assault; the women involved had far more credible evidence than many of the most notorious accusations that have come to light in the past five weeks. But Clinton was not left to the swift and pitiless justice that today s accused men have experienced. Rather, he was rescued by a surprising force: machine feminism. The movement had by then ossified into a partisan operation, and it was willing eager to let this friend of the sisterhood enjoy a little droit de seigneur.The Atlantic went on to point out an op-ed by the so-called  Champion of women s rights  Gloria Steinem, where she slut-shamed and bashed the women who dared to come forward and accuse Bill Clinton of rape and other forms of criminal sexual assault.The notorious 1998 New York Times op-ed by Gloria Steinem must surely stand as one of the most regretted public actions of her life. It slut-shamed, victim-blamed, and age-shamed; it urged compassion for and gratitude to the man the women accused.Called  Feminists and the Clinton Question,  it was written in March of 1998 when Paula Jones s harassment claim was working its way through court. It was printed seven days after Kathleen Willey s blockbuster 60 Minutes interview with Ed Bradley. If all the various allegations were true, wrote Steinem, Bill Clinton was  a candidate for sex addiction therapy.  To her mind, the most  credible  accusations were those of Willey, who she noted was  old enough to be Monica Lewinsky s mother.  And then she wrote the fatal sentences that invalidated the new understanding of workplace sexual harassment as a moral and legal wrong:  Even if the allegations are true, the President is not guilty of sexual harassment. He is accused of having made a gross, dumb, and reckless pass at a supporter during a low point in her life. She pushed him away, she said, and it never happened again. In other words, President Clinton took  no  for an answer. Steinem said the same was true of Paula Jones. These were not crimes; they were  passes.  Broaddrick was left out by Steinem, who revealed herself as a combination John and Bobby Kennedy of the feminist movement: the fair-haired girl and the bare-knuckle fixer. The widespread liberal response to the sex-crime accusations against Bill Clinton found their natural consequence 20 years later in the behavior of Harvey Weinstein: Stay loudly and publicly and extravagantly on the side of signal leftist causes and you can do what you want in the privacy of your offices and hotel rooms. But the mood of the country has changed. We are in a time when old monuments are coming down and men are losing their careers over things they did to women a long time ago.When more than a dozen women stepped forward and accused Leon Wieseltier of a serial and decades-long pattern of workplace sexual harassment, he said,  I will not waste this reckoning.  It was textbook Wieseltier: the insincere promise and the perfectly chosen word. The Democratic Party needs to make its own reckoning of the way it protected Bill Clinton. The party needs to come to terms with the fact that it was so enraptured by their brilliant, Big Dog president and his stunning string of progressive accomplishments that it abandoned some of its central principles. The party was on the wrong side of history, and there are consequences for that. Yet expedience is not the only reason to make this public accounting. If it is possible for politics and moral behavior to coexist, then this grave wrong needs to be acknowledged. If Weinstein and Mark Halperin and Louis C. K. and all the rest can be held accountable, so can our former president and so can his party, which so many Americans so desperately need to rise again.Watch Gloria Steinem several years after writing the op-ed where she shamed Bill s victims, helping to celebrate Hillary s birthday while honoring the woman who threatened the women bravely stepped forward to expose her sexually abusive husband Bill Clinton.Grant J. Kidney s video that he posted to Twitter, really shows the slow, but necessary admission by the leftist media, that they too, bear responsibility for shaming Bill Clinton s victims, simply because believing them, or giving them any kind of credibility, would ve harmed the  Democrat Party they are beholden to. Fake News CNN admits that Bill Clinton is a rapist. Attorney General Jeff Sessions must launch an immediate criminal probe into the dirty dealings of the Clinton Foundation as well as into the sexually perverted past of former President Bill Clinton.   pic.twitter.com/oVUHn1LPej  GRANT J. KIDNEY   (@GrantJKidney) November 14, 2017Who can forget how the media attacked Donald Trump for bringing up the allegations of sexual abuse by Bill Clinton s abusers during his debate with Hillary? Will the media apologize to President Trump, now that they ve come to the conclusion they are as guilty as the Democrat Party for hiding decades of sexual abuse, and then criticizing Trump for defending Bill and Hillary s victims?For anyone who is wondering if Gloria Steinem has had a change of heart, after having a significant time to reflect on her defense of the Clinton Crime family and slut-shaming Bill s innocent victims, you don t need to wonder anymore. On October 20, 2017, Gloria Steinem announced that she will be warding that Hillary Clinton would be the first recipient of her  Wonder Woman Award. The Women s Media Center, co-founded by feminist Gloria Steinem, told us that it is giving the latest Democratic presidential candidate its first  Wonder Woman Award  for her  extraordinary accomplishments  and public service. Like Wonder Woman, she seems to have superhuman strength, resilience, and courage,  said the group in a reference to the famous comic and TV character. Hillary Clinton s actions have inspired and protected women and men on every continent,  said Steinem.  She has battled negative forces and helped to maintain a fragile peace with her negotiating skill on behalf of this country and peace-seekers everywhere. She has handled all this with grace, grit, determination, integrity, humor and fortitude while remaining a steadfast feminist, advocate, activist, sister and tireless leader in the revolution. With this award, the Women s Media Center declares Hillary Clinton our Wonder Woman.   The Washington Examiner ',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. Environmental Protection Agency has backed off a series of proposed changes to the nation’s biofuels policy after a massive backlash from corn-state lawmakers worried the moves would undercut ethanol demand, according to a letter from the agency to lawmakers seen by Reuters. EPA Administrator Scott Pruitt said in the letter dated Oct. 19 that the agency will keep renewable fuel volume mandates for next year at or above proposed levels, reversing a previous move to open the door to cuts.  The move marks a big win for the biofuels industry and lawmakers from corn-states like Iowa, Nebraska and Illinois, while dealing a blow to merchant refiners like PBF Energy Inc and Valero Energy Corp who hoped the administration of President Donald Trump would help provide regulatory relief. The White House issued a statement hours after the Pruitt letter was delivered to lawmakers expressing the president’s support for maintaining the renewable fuel plan.  “President Donald J. Trump promised rural America that he would protect the Renewable Fuel Standard (RFS), and has never wavered from that promise,” the White House statement said. Trump’s second-place finish in the Iowa caucuses in early 2016 gave credibility to his candidacy and he defeated Democrat Hillary Clinton in the state in the Nov. 8 election. It was the first time a Republican had won Iowa since George W. Bush in 2004 and provided Trump a key takeaway. The letter could end uncertainty about the future of the U.S. Renewable Fuel Standard that has roiled commodity and energy markets for months. The program, which requires refineries to blend increasing amounts of ethanol and other biofuels into the nation’s fuel supply or buy credits from those who do, appeared on the verge of a massive overhaul. The most popular form of program credits hit two-month highs on Friday on the EPA news, traders said..  The so-called D6 credits sunk to 68 cents last month as EPA considered cost-cutting measures, but prices have rebounded in recent weeks and approached 90 cents on Friday, traders said. Pruitt said the EPA would not pursue another idea floated by EPA leadership that would have allowed exported ethanol to be counted toward those volume quotas. Pruitt also said the EPA did not believe a proposal to shift the biofuels blending obligation away from refiners was appropriate. That plan is backed by representatives of a handful of independent refining companies who have warned the cost of the program will bankrupt plants and cost thousands of jobs. Those ideas would have eased the burden on some in the refining industry, who have argued that biofuels compete with petroleum, and that the blending responsibility costs them hundreds of millions of dollars a year. But Midwestern lawmakers, including Republicans Charles Grassley and Joni Ernst, had vocally opposed all those ideas, calling them a betrayal of the administration’s promises to support the corn belt. They were concerned the moves would undercut domestic demand for ethanol, a key industry in the region that has supported corn growers.  “It’s a great day for Iowa and a great day for rural America. Administrator Pruitt should be commended for following through on President Trump’s commitment to biofuels,” Grassley said in a statement. In the letter, Pruitt said the EPA was prepared to work with Congress to examine the possibility of a waiver that would allow the sale of E15 gasoline, containing 15 percent ethanol, year-round - something currently not permitted during the summer due to concerns about smog. Renewable Fuels Association President and Chief Executive Bob Dinneen said in a response to the letter on Friday morning that the U.S. ethanol industry was “grateful for Administrator Pruitt’s epiphany on the road to the RFS.”  The program disproportionately hurts mid-sized refiners and mom-and-pop gas stations that are the backbone of the nation’s energy infrastructure and needs to reformed, said Greg Blair, a spokesman for the Fueling American Jobs Coalition, a group of merchant refiners formed to seek changes in the program. “If the administration follows the course set out in Administrator Pruitt’s letter, manufacturing jobs in Pennsylvania, Ohio and other states – jobs President Trump promised to protect – will be at risk,” Blair said.

       " 'The Satanic Temple just forced a total shutdown of all prayer at Phoenix City Council meetings, by requesting that they also be allowed to offer prayers at the start of meetings like their Christian counterparts.Phoenix lawmakers have been trying to figure out what to do regarding the request for weeks. They couldn t allow all prayer, because it would have meant they supported Satanists in some people s minds. They couldn t allow only Christian prayer, due to inevitable lawsuits, so ultimately they came to what shouldn t be   but is   a very controversial solution: Banning prayer completely from the meetings.Lawmakers decided in a 5-4 vote that council meetings will now begin with a moment of silence instead of a Christian prayer. The moment of silence is intended to allow individuals to pray to whatever god is their personal choice, and leaves it out of the public domain completely. This is a pretty reasonable solution, since there isn t to be any mingling of church and state. However, these are red state Christian extremists we are talking about. Their struggle is REAL.The objections have been emotional, loud and generally ignorant. Christians are pushing for their right to pray, but they don t seem to understand the fact they can t allow their prayers while banning others. The Phoenix council had an option of either allowing the alternate prayers, or banning them while facing a First Amendment-based lawsuit that is practically a guaranteed loss for them. They chose a third option of banning all prayer (the best option) completely. Now they are being threatened with even more lawsuits from Christians that want to insert religion into government   as long as it s only Christian religion.The blubbering outcry by the Christian extremists is almost comical. Councilman Sal DiCiccio said: This is what that Satanist group wants. A moment of silence is basically a banning of prayer. It s to agree to the Satanic goal to ban prayer. Yup, that s it alright. They just let The Devil win! Actually, the Founding Fathers had the crazy idea to ban religion from public governance, but hey, facts don t really matter when it comes to religion.There were a great deal of gasps and clutching of pearls, but somehow Phoenix was not consumed by the desert in a massive sandstorm by the wrath of God. Frogs have chosen to not fall from the sky and the firstborn of Arizona are currently safe from the angel of death. Funny isn t it, how Republicans claim America is a  Christian  nation, but the only ones who care about the Constitution are the atheists, agnostics, and Satanists these days.Watch Christian outcry on the victory of Satan over Freedom below:Featured image from video screen capture',\n",

But I don t doubt his sincerity. I think he cares about some real, legitimate issues that have to be talked about. If nothing else, he s generated more conversation about issues that have to be talked about. Obama said he has not closely followed the controversy surrounding Kaepernick s actions while he has been overseas, but he said he was aware of the public response, which has been sharply divided. The president has sought to balance his own response to the unrest and mistrust between African Americans and police officers over the past several years, including in Baton Rouge and Dallas this year. You ve heard me talk in the past about the need for us to have an active citizenry,  Obama said.  Sometimes that s messy and controversial and gets people angry and frustrated.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Seven Democratic senators urged the U.S. Justice Department on Wednesday to block two mergers of major health insurance companies, saying that the proposed deals would mean higher premiums and lower-quality healthcare for consumers. The department is reviewing Aetna Inc’s $33 billion plan to buy Humana Inc and Anthem Inc’s $48 billion proposal to buy Cigna Corp. If approved, the deals, both of which were announced last July, would reduce the number of national health insurance carriers from five to three. “We urge the DOJ (Justice Department) to challenge these mergers from proceeding and to prevent the damage they would cause to competition and consumers,” wrote Senators Richard Blumenthal of Connecticut, Al Franken of Minnesota, Elizabeth Warren and Edward Markey of Massachusetts, Sherrod Brown of Ohio, Dianne Feinstein of California and Mazie Hirono of Hawaii. The letter was dated Wednesday and addressed to Renata Hesse, who heads the Justice Department’s Antitrust Division. In the letter, the lawmakers said they were skeptical of the idea that the proposed deals would be good for consumers because the companies could use their larger size to hammer out better deals for patients.  “The evidence overwhelmingly suggests that few if any cost savings secured by the merging firms through the exercise of market power will be passed on to consumers,” they wrote. The lawmakers also disagreed with the notion that the sale of carefully chosen assets to a competitor could resolve antitrust issues, and pointed to past instances where mergers with divestitures led to higher premiums or where competitors bought divested assets, but then did not use them. “We are not convinced that any divestitures required of the merging parties will succeed today, given that they have so clearly failed in the recent past,” the lawmakers wrote. Capitol Hill does not have a say in whether the Justice Department sues to stop deals. Aetna spokesman T.J. Crawford said that the company planned to close the merger with Humana in the second half of this year. “We believe a combined company is in the best interest of consumers. We continue to cooperate with the Department of Justice on its thorough review of the transaction,” Crawford said. Representatives of Anthem could not immediately be reached for comment. ',\n",

Bel Edwards s advice, Trump proceeded to get that photo-op, which consisted of him handing out play-doh instead of real supplies such as food and water.But Giuliani criticized Bel Edwards for making such a request and said that reaction towards President Obama is not the same negative reaction President Bush received after Hurricane Katrina.Giuliani said that Trump showed  true leadership  by going to the flood ravaged state and then plugged his book in the same breath.Then he bragged about being the mayor of NYC during the September 11th attacks.Here s the full post via Twitter.Giuliani statement on Louisiana s governor criticizing Trump trip:  During the September 11 attacks, I welcomed  pic.twitter.com/wFDRW5qhyi  Bradd Jaffy (@BraddJaffy) August 19, 2016On Sunday, Bel Edwards fired back by telling CNN s Dana Bash that there is not a double standard here. I believe Mayor Giuliani got it completely wrong. I have not been critical of Mr. Trump s visit. I have tried not to comment because I don t want to get tied up in the politics of whether it s the president, whether it s Hillary Clinton or whether it s Donald Trump. I have tried not to comment. And the comments that I have made have been very reserved. So I think he was off base there with that comment. So I think he was off base there with that comment. Bel Edwards went on to point out that the reason President Obama has not visited Baton Rouge yet is because he asked him to come next week instead.Here s the video via CNN.But Edwards explained why President Obama was right not to visit yet during an interview with Rachel Maddow on Thursday. It is a major ordeal, they free up the interstate for him. We have to take hundreds of local first responders, police officers, sheriffs, deputies and state troopers to provide security for that type of visit. I would just as soon have those people engaged in the response rather than trying to secure the president. So I d ask him to wait, if he would, another couple weeks. So President Obama s presence would have been a major distraction and would have kept first responders from doing their jobs to help those in need.But that doesn t mean President Obama has done nothing like Republicans would have us believe. Gov. Edwards said on that point: I do want you to know, and your viewers to know, that within hours of me making a request for a federal declaration I got it from the president. He called me. I want you to know that I ve been speaking to Valerie Jarrett just about every day. He dispatched the FEMA administrator to meet with me for an entire day. Today I had the Homeland Security Secretary Jeh Johnson. We ve also had the four-star general who runs all of the guard for the country here today. And that s in addition to FEMA workers who have been embedded in the state in preparation for the relief effort.President Bush was not so much criticized for not visiting as much as he was criticized for not being prepared and not doing enough to help the victims in the wake of Hurricane Katrina, a storm that took the lives of nearly 2,000 people. FEMA was completely disorganized under Bush s watch. But President Obama has been on top of this latest disaster in Louisiana since the beginning.So Giuliani is out of line for criticizing President Obama. And he is out of line for criticizing Bel Edwards for making a reasonable request of Trump. Louisiana needs help, not photo-ops. Trump visited a Republican dominated area to make it look like he was universally welcomed in the state when it is clear that he wasn t. President Obama s presence would have only hindered the rescue and recovery effort. And you know Republicans would have whined about that if he had visited.Featured image via screen capture',\n",

       " 'TORONTO (Reuters) - A former Canadian police chief and several colleagues who fought against making marijuana use legal have switched sides and embraced the looming legalization of cannabis with a leap into business. With Canada s legalization of a multi-billion dollar marijuana industry set for next year, former police officers who once argued for mandatory jail time for minor marijuana offences are among those in line to capitalize on the change. The most high profile is Julian Fantino, a former Toronto police chief and Conservative cabinet minister who fought against the legalization of pot and who said he now sees the value of a legal medical pot industry.  For a lot of us, until you get into this thing, all we know is the stigma associated with marijuana. And there is that, of course, but ... it s only a matter of time, before it becomes a recognized, therapeutic, prescribed drug,  Fantino said in an interview. Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau promised to legalize recreational marijuana use in his 2015 election campaign and new legislation will let adults grow, buy or possess small amounts of marijuana as of July 1, 2018. Under the new law, private or government retailers will be able to sell marijuana and licensed producers will be able to grow it. The Canadian cannabis black market is estimated to be worth between C$7 billion ($5.77 billion) and C$10 billion a year, with rates of youth use among the highest in the world. Analysts expect it will take time for legal trade to push aside unsanctioned competition. Fantino and his partners - a former Royal Canadian Mounted Police officer, a former fire chief and a former member of parliament - are promoting their company Aleafia, which provides patients with authorizations for medical marijuana, as well as other medical services. Medical marijuana is already legal. Fantino said he would  absolutely  be pursuing the business even if Canada was not legalizing the lucrative recreational industry. But his change of heart has met with skepticism in some circles. Toronto Star newspaper columnist Royson James wrote  the hypocrisy stinks to high heaven.  On Twitter, pot activist Jodie Emery called the news  infuriating.   The Canadian Broadcasting Corp introduced an interview with Fantino by noting he had  once compared weed to murder.  Fantino said the quote was taken out of context and he  did what I could to apply the laws of the land with conscience.  Other ex-cops are getting into the business side of marijuana. Former deputy Toronto police chief Kim Derry has been involved in medical marijuana businesses since 2012. Derry is president of Met-Scan Canada, which he said provides security for about half a dozen marijuana growers. He expects that number to grow once recreational production becomes legal.  From a background of criminal activity, I certainly know how (grow operations) operated in the past,  Derry said.  I know all the pieces, through a chain of supply, where there s weaknesses.  The government s effort to legalize marijuana is headed up by another former Toronto police chief, Bill Blair, who succeeded Fantino in 2005 before they both turned to politics. Blair said retired police officers have been getting calls for advice on medical marijuana production since related laws came into effect in 2013.   I think many are being sought out for their expertise in public service and regulatory law and security around these things,  he said, adding he does not think its unseemly for police officers to make money off cannabis.  For me, it s entirely consistent with my life s work and I wouldn t comment on anyone else s history or motives.  Pot possession remains illegal until July and Canadians continue to be prosecuted for it - 17,733 people in 2016, according to Statistics Canada. Studies have found marginalized communities are disproportionately targeted. The government is developing ways to track each marijuana plant from seed to point of sale and test for quality. It has yet to draft detailed advertising rules or finalize tax levels. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senator Marco Rubio, who announced his retirement from the Senate after ending his Republican presidential bid in March, said on Monday he would reconsider his future after being urged to seek re-election in the aftermath of the Orlando nightclub massacre.   The Florida Republican told radio host Hugh Hewitt in an interview that the worst mass shooting in U.S. history “most certainly has impacted my thinking in general, at least, about a lot of things.” But Rubio said he has not considered the rampage from a political perspective. “When it visits your home state, when it impacts a community you know well, it really gives you pause to think a little bit about your service to your country and where you can be most useful to your country,” Rubio said. “My family and I will be praying about all this and we’ll see what I need to do next with my life in regards to how I can best serve.”   Hewitt urged Rubio to remain in the Senate, describing the lawmaker who sits on the Senate intelligence and foreign relations committees as one of the “very few people” who know the security issues raised by Sunday’s rampage. News of the interview brought an attack on Rubio’s voting record from Senate Democratic leader Harry Reid of Nevada, who referred to the Republican repeatedly as “the junior senator” from Florida.  “How can he speak of running for office again when he voted to let potential terrorists buy assault weapons and explosives?” Reid asked on the floor of the Senate. “That is how he voted. The junior senator voted against every gun safety measure.” Rubio, who is also seen as a potential vice presidential running mate for Republican Donald Trump, announced that he would retire from the Senate and take a break from politics after losing Florida’s presidential primary in March to Trump. Before Sunday, Senate Republican leader Mitch McConnell and others had urged him to seek re-election, citing polling data that showed he would win re-election and help Republicans retain their Senate majority. Rubio has backed his friend and fellow Republican, Florida Lieutenant Governor Carlos Lopez-Cantera, in Florida’s August primary contest for his Senate seat.    If he were to run for re-election, Rubio would have to decide by a June 24 filing deadline. ',\n",

       " 'ATHENS (Reuters) - Three people drowned, at least six were missing and scores of others were rescued in three separate incidents of migrants trying to reach Greece across the Aegean Sea early Friday. Greek authorities recovered the body of a woman and searched for more people missing after a wooden boat carrying migrants sank off Kalymnos island, close to the Turkish coast. Fifteen people, 10 men, four women and a child, were rescued, and Greek coastguard vessels were searching for another six to eight people missing, a Greek coastguard official said. The Turkish coastguard said it recovered another two bodies on its side of the maritime border, and that the boat was carrying 27 people. Rescue operations in Turkish waters were ongoing, it said. The departure point of the boat and the nationality of those on board was not immediately clear. Separately, Greece rescued 127 migrants and refugees off Chios island on board two boats in distress earlier on Friday, the coastguard said. Arrivals of refugees and migrants to Greece, which shares a long sea border with Turkey, have increased in recent months, but not on the scale of mass arrivals in 2015. Nearly 148,100 refugees and migrants have crossed to Greece from Turkey this year - a fraction of the nearly 1 million arrivals in 2015 - but arrivals have increased in recent months. An average 214 people arrived daily in September, compared with 156 in August and 87 in July, Greece s migration minister, Yannis Mouzalas, said on Wednesday.     About 60,000 refugees and migrants, mostly Syrians, Afghans and Iraqis, have been stranded in Greece after border closures in the Balkans halted the onward journey many planned to take to central and western Europe.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The head of the U.S. Federal Communications Commission unveiled plans on Tuesday to repeal landmark 2015 rules that prohibited internet service providers from impeding consumer access to web content in a move that promises to recast the digital landscape. FCC chief Ajit Pai, a Republican appointed by President Donald Trump in January, said the commission will vote at a Dec. 14 meeting on his plan to rescind the so-called net neutrality rules championed by Democratic former President Barack Obama that treated internet service providers like public utilities. The rules barred broadband providers from blocking or slowing down access to content or charging consumers more for certain content. They were intended to ensure a free and open internet, give consumers equal access to web content and prevent broadband service providers from favoring their own content. The action marks a victory for big internet service providers such as AT&T Inc, Comcast Corp and Verizon Communications Inc that opposed the rules and gives them sweeping powers to decide what web content consumers can get and at what price. It represents a setback for Google parent Alphabet Inc and Facebook Inc, which had urged Pai not to rescind the rules. Netflix said Tuesday it opposed the measure to “roll back these core protections.” With three Republican and two Democratic commissioners, the move is all but certain to be approved. Trump, a Republican, expressed his opposition to net neutrality in 2014 before the regulations were even implemented, calling it a “power grab” by Obama. The White House did not immediately comment Tuesday. Pai said his proposal would prevent state and local governments from creating their own net neutrality rules because internet service is “inherently an interstate service.” The preemption is most likely to handcuff Democratic-governed states and localities that could have considered their own plans to protect consumers’ equal access to internet content. “The FCC will no longer be in the business of micromanaging business models and preemptively prohibiting services and applications and products that could be pro-competitive,” Pai said in an interview, adding that the Obama administration had sought to pick winners and losers and exercised “heavy-handed” regulation of the internet. “We should simply set rules of the road that let companies of all kinds in every sector compete and let consumers decide who wins and loses,” Pai added. Tom Wheeler, who headed the FCC under Obama and advocated for the net neutrality rules, called the planned repeal “a shameful sham and sellout. Even for this FCC and its leadership, this proposal raises hypocrisy to new heights.” AT&T, Comcast and Verizon have said that repealing the rules could lead to billions of dollars in additional broadband investment and eliminate the possibility that a future presidential administration could regulate internet pricing. Comcast said no matter what the FCC decided it would “not block, throttle, or discriminate against lawful content.”  Verizon said it believed the FCC “will reinstate a framework that protects consumers’ access to the open internet, without forcing them to bear the heavy costs from unnecessary regulation.” The Internet Association, representing major technology firms including Alphabet and Facebook, said Pai’s proposal “represents the end of net neutrality as we know it and defies the will of millions of Americans.” “This proposal undoes nearly two decades of bipartisan agreement on baseline net neutrality principles that protect Americans’ ability to access the entire internet,” it said. Pai’s proposal would require internet service providers to disclose whether they allow blocking or slowing down of consumer web access or permit so-called internet fast lanes to facilitate a practice called paid prioritization of charging for certain content. Such disclosure will make it easier for another agency, the Federal Trade Commission, to act against internet service providers that fail to disclose such conduct to consumers, Pai said. The FTC could seek to bar practices that it deemed “anticompetitive” or violated antitrust rules. The FCC received more than 22 million comments. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman disclosed Tuesday he has been investigating for more than six months in a bid to learn who was behind the filing of false comments. A U.S. appeals court last year upheld the legality of the net neutrality regulations, which were challenged in a lawsuit led by telecommunications industry trade association US Telecom. The group praised Pai’s decision to remove “antiquated, restrictive regulations” to “pave the way for broadband network investment, expansion and upgrades.” The FCC’s repeal is certain to draw a legal challenge from advocates of net neutrality. Nancy Pelosi, the top U.S. House of Representatives Democrat, said the FCC move would hurt consumers and chill competition, saying the agency “has launched an all-out assault on the entrepreneurship, innovation and competition at the heart of the internet.” The planned repeal represents the latest example of a legacy achievement of Obama being erased since Trump took office in January. Trump has abandoned international trade deals, the landmark Paris climate accord and environmental protections, taken aim at the Iran nuclear accord and closer relations with Cuba, and sought repeal Obama’s signature healthcare law. Pai, who has moved quickly to undo numerous regulatory actions since becoming FCC chairman, is pushing a broad deregulatory agenda. Pai said he had not shared his plans on the rollback with the White House in advance or been directed to undo net neutrality by White House officials. The FCC under Obama regulated internet service providers like public utilities under a section of federal law that gave the agency sweeping oversight over the conduct of these companies. Language in the new proposal would give the FCC significantly less authority to oversee the web. The FCC granted initial approval to Pai’s plan in May, but had left open many key questions including whether to retain any legal requirements limiting internet providers conduct. His plan would eliminate the “internet conduct standard,” which gave the FCC far-reaching discretion to prohibit improper internet service provider practices. ',\n",
       " 'PUEBLO, Colo. (Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump said on Monday he “brilliantly used” U.S. tax rules to his advantage in trying to limit the amount he paid in taxes, arguing it helped him survive a difficult period in the real estate market. “I was able to use the tax laws of this country and my business acumen to dig out of the real estate mess ... when few others were able to do what I did,” Trump told a crowd in Pueblo, Colorado. It was Trump’s first extended comments since a New York Times report said he had claimed a $916 million loss on his 1995 tax returns, which experts said might have allowed him to avoid paying federal income taxes for 18 years.  Hillary Clinton, the Democratic nominee for the Nov. 8 election, has seized on the report, arguing the tax records undercut Trump’s business acumen.  “What kind of genius loses a billion dollars in a single year? This is Trump to a T, he’s taken corporate excess and made a business out of it,” Clinton told a rally in Toledo, Ohio, on Monday. Clinton has repeatedly called on Trump to release his full returns, as presidential candidates have done in the past.  Trump was dismissive of the Times’ story in his Pueblo remarks, saying the media was “obsessed with an alleged tax filing from the 1990s.” The Trump campaign has not said, however, that the Times’ story was inaccurate. Instead, his supporters, including former New York Mayor Rudy Giuliani and New Jersey Governor Chris Christie have contended that Trump’s aggressive use of provisions under U.S. law to minimize his tax liability was evidence of his “genius” as a businessman and real estate investor. Trump picked up on that theme on Monday. “I have brilliantly used those laws,” he told the crowd in Pueblo. The flap over Trump’s taxes comes during what has been a difficult stretch for the candidate, who faced criticism for his performance in the Sept. 26 debate against Clinton and his subsequent public spat with former Miss Universe Alicia Machado. A Reuters/Ipsos online poll last week showed a majority of Americans felt Clinton won the debate, the first of three scheduled between the candidates.. On Monday, the state of New York ordered Trump’s charity, the Trump Foundation, to suspend raising money amid a probe into its activities. ',\n",

       " 'The fact that German Chancellor Angela Merkel is no fan of Donald Trump is no secret. However, being the diplomatic, experienced world leader that she is, Chancellor Merkel took the time she was forced to spend at the White House with Trump in stride. She smiled at the cameras at all the right times, held a joint presser with him, and was cordial to all, as real world leaders do. This all comes as Trump insulted Merkel more than once during the visit. We all know that he infamously embarrassed our nation by petulantly refusing to shake the Chancellor s hand, and now, there is a new report out that Trump actually gave Merkel an  invoice  for expenses that he believes Germany owes for defenses provided by the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO).According to The Hill via a report from The Times of London, Trump s insane bill  charges  Merkel roughly 300 billion pounds. A response from a German minister on Trump s childish stunt was predictably and deservedly scathing, essentially saying that Merkel has no intentions of stooping to Trump s level: The concept behind putting out such demands is to intimidate the other side, but the chancellor took it calmly and will not respond to such provocations. The same minister said that Merkel, quote,  ignored the provocations.  Of course, the White House says that Trump never gave Merkel the invoice, but that s likely just another lie to cover up for Trump s petulant, childish, and internationally embarrassing behavior.In fact, it is perfectly plausible that Trump gave Merkel this  invoice,  because he had already had aides calculate just how much below 2 percent of Germany s Gross Domestic Product (GDP) was spent on NATO defense in the last 12 years. Countries within NATO all commit to spending 2 percent of their GDP annually to support NATO. Trump even had the people doing the calculations add interest.This is just beyond embarrassing.

       " 'There are plenty of politicians of many stripes who are very afraid of the idea of a Donald Trump presidency, and with good reason. One of them seems to be former New York City mayor Michael Bloomberg. Bloomberg was once a Democrat, but switched his party affiliation to Independent circa the year 2000, and ran and won the city s mayorship as a Republican before formally becoming a member of the GOP. However, Bloomberg is definitely not a fall into line party guy.In 2012, he endorsed President Barack Obama s second bid for the White House, and now, here in 2016, he is endorsing Hillary Clinton for president. Bloomberg is not only endorsing Clinton, but he will speak at the Democratic National Convention in Philadelphia during prime time. That means he will be going on during the same time as Democratic stars such as President Obama and Vice President Joe Biden. One of Bloomberg s top advisers, Howard Wolfson, says of the decision: As the nation s leading independent and a pragmatic business leader Mike (Bloomberg) has supported candidates from both sides of the aisle. This week in Philadelphia he will make a strong case that the clear choice in this election is Hillary Clinton. This isn t necessarily a huge surprise, as Bloomberg has definitely gone after Trump on some of his more alarming policy proposals. This is especially true of Trump s plan to ban Muslims from traveling across the U.S. border, and his ideas regarding building a wall along the southern border and forcing Mexico to pay for it, and the mass deportation plans. Despite the lack of surprise, though, this is an important endorsement. Bloomberg is a billionaire, just like Trump, and he is a high profile GOP politician. This is definitely a signal to the sane Republicans that are left that they need to do the right thing and endorse and vote for Hillary Clinton.It s not about betraying one s party or one s principles.

       " \"NEW YORK/WELLINGTON (Reuters) - Erik Duhaime is a passive stock market investor, but he isn’t afraid to short Donald Trump or go long on Hillary Clinton. The 28-year-old from Cambridge, Massachusetts, trades on PredictIt, an online political stock market that allows users to wager small amounts of money on “yes” or “no” predictions about whether an event will occur. That includes who will win the U.S. presidential election in November. “This is probably one of the ways I restrain myself from being active in the stock market,” said Duhaime, a PhD student at Massachusetts Institute of Technology Sloan School of Management, who checks the site a few times a week for fun. PredictIt, which was launched in 2014, now has more than 30,000 traders registered, up from 19,000 at the end of 2015, and has received shout-outs from pundits and presidential campaign advisors alike. Users must be U.S. residents and registered voters. PredictIt says it is not like an online gambling site because it mainly exists to supply its data to universities for academic research, one of the main reasons the U.S. Commodity Futures Trading Commission allows it to operate legally, according to a letter issued by the regulator in 2014. It is jointly run by Victoria University in Wellington, New Zealand, and a Washington-based political consulting firm Aristotle International Inc.  Unlike mainstream financial markets, bets are not big: The CFTC caps each participant’s position at $850 per market, and the average deposit when people sign up is just $100. The regulator hasn’t been as friendly to such betting sites in the past. In 2012, the CFTC filed a civil complaint against the now defunct Intrade for violating a ban on off-exchange options trading. The Ireland-based market also allowed people to wager money on “yes” or “no” questions, but it wasn’t tied to an academic institution and didn’t have a cap on the maximum amount that could be traded.  Predictions markets like PredictIt and a similar venue run by the University of Iowa have emerged as an alternative to polling for election forecasters. PredictIt is bigger than the Iowa Electronic Markets, which has only about 2,000 active traders with access to its political markets. “Polling is very expensive,” said David Rothschild, an economist at Microsoft Research who runs a predictions-market aggregator called PredictWise, which draws heavily from PredictIt. “It’s a slow process. It’s not very flexible.” Knowledge of polls does also feed into betting decisions on PredictIt. “Predictions markets translate this and other information into probability,” said Rajiv Sethi, professor of economics at Barnard College. “The basic intuition is that it’s a ‘wisdom of crowds’ effect.”     For example, Trump’s chances of securing the Republican nomination for the presidential election swung dramatically on the site over the past three months as the primary season progressed. A Trump share shot from 30 cents in early February when he lost to rival Ted Cruz in the Iowa primary to 80 cents a month later when Trump dominated on Super Tuesday. They then lost half their value by early April as Cruz appeared to regain momentum with a big win in Wisconsin. With Cruz and another rival, John Kasich, now out of the race, Trump had risen to 94 cents by Monday. For graphic showing Trump's ascendancy on PredictIt during primary season, see tmsnrt.rs/1WmRq For November’s election, though, Trump is trailing on PredictIt with 40 cents against Clinton’s 59 cents.  While PredictIt’s precision has yet to be closely examined by academics, other predictions markets such as the Iowa Electronic Markets, have proven to be just as accurate as polls, experts who have studied them said. PredictIt markets go beyond topics related to U.S. elections. Users also put the probability of a North Korea hydrogen bomb test this year at only 29 cents, and a British exit from the European Union by 2017 at just 30 cents. The idea for PredictIt was first thought up in the mid-1990s by Lew Evans, professor of economics at the University of Victoria. It took until 2008, for the market, called “iPredict” in New Zealand, to get up and running.  Early on, it focused primarily on New Zealand politics, and research showed iPredict out-performed the majority of polls in predicting the results in two of New Zealand’s last three general elections. However, new anti-money laundering laws in New Zealand put an end to iPredict last year after the cost of verifying users’ identities to comply with the rules threatened to blow through iPredict’s shoe-string budget.\\xa0  PredictIt attracts everyone from campaign volunteers to political junkies. In mid-April, about 30 PredictIt traders gathered at a bar in New York to watch the state’s primary results roll in. “I think it’s a good source of collective wisdom,” said Brian Hegarty, who was at the event. Hegarty, who worked for Kasich’s campaign, reads political news, but also relied on picking up information through his campaign experience. That didn’t always translate to a bet in favor of Kasich. He said he put money on Republican candidate Marco Rubio to win the Minnesota caucus because he had overheard someone who was working for the Florida senator express confidence about Rubio’s chances. It turned out to be one of the few states Rubio won before dropping out in mid-March. Duhaime, the MIT student,\\xa0said he usually bets against candidates he believes are likely to flame out.  “For me, Trump was one of those people,” he said. “I shorted Trump way back in July, and it hasn’t been fun watching.”  After Trump’s win in Indiana in early May, Duhaime was down nearly $1,000, about a third of the money he put into PredictIt.  “I still think it was a one in a hundred thing,” Duhaime, who doesn’t identify as a Democrat but is a fan of President Barack Obama, said of the Trump phenomenon. “Obviously I’m bummed, but I’m sort of more concerned for other reasons.” (This version of the story corrects the spelling of Lew Evans) \",\n",
       " 'JPMorgan Chase CEO Jamie Dimon went on a rant about the dysfunction in DC during the company s earnings conference call Friday: The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet Dimon had been considered for a position in President Trump s cabinet. He s been an adviser to Trump too. While there are some things Dimon clearly disagrees with the president on, they are able to work together: He is the President of the United States. I believe he is the pilot flying our airplane,  Dimon said,  I would try to help any President of the United States because I m a patriot. During the bank s annual meeting in May, 2016, Dimon reportedly commented on what he thinks the government should work on:Dimon emphasized the areas he believes are in serious need of fixing, including education, infrastructure, and tax reform. Our corporate tax system is driving capital and brains overseas and excessive regulation is reducing growth and business formation particularly for small businesses. THE STUPID SH*T WE HAVE TO DEAL WITH IN THIS COUNTRY It s almost embarrassment to be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country,  Dimon said in response to an analyst question. Since the Great Recession, which is now 8 years old, we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2 percent in spite of stupidity and political gridlock, because the American business sector is powerful and strong,  he said.  What I m saying is that it would be much stronger growth if there were more intelligent decisions and less gridlock. The executive of the U.S. banking giant cited travels to countries such as France, Argentina, Israel and Ireland. The U.S. has become  one of the most bureaucratic, confusing, litigious societies on the planet  and  it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies,  he said.JPMorgan Chase reported earnings that handily beat Wall Street estimates Friday. However, the bank lowered its forecast for lending revenue.DC has been in gridlock over the health care bill, which is holding up the passage of new legislation on tax reform. The Senate cut short its August recess by two weeks in order to deal with health care. There are about a dozen Senators opposed to the current bill citing the possibility that this new health care bill is  Obamacare lite . Senator Rand Paul has voiced strong opposition to this new bill.Here s the transcript from Dimon:Since the Great Recession which is now eight years old we ve been growing at 1.5 to 2% despite the stupidity and political gridlock. Because the American business sector is powerful and strong and is going to grow regardless of they went to feed their kids and want to buy home they want to do things the same as American businesses what I m saying is it would be much stronger growth had we made intelligent decisions and that gridlock, and thank you for pointing it out because I m going to be a broken record until this gets done, we are unable to build bridges, unable to build airports, not graduating.I was just in France, in Argentina, Israel, Ireland we met with the Prime Minister of India and China it s amazing to me that every single one of those countries understands that practical policies to promote business growth is good for the average citizens of those countries for jobs and wages and somehow this great American free enterprise system we no longer get it.My view is corporate taxation is critical to that by the way regarding capital brings overseas, which is why the $2 trillion overseas benefiting all these other countries don t like that, so if we don t get our act together we can still grow. It s just unfortunate but it s hurting us, it s hurting the body politic, it s hurting the average American that we don t have these right policies. So no in spite of gridlock we will grow at 1   or 2%.I don t buy the argument that we are relegated to this effort. We are not this administration can make breakthroughs in taxes and infrastructure ready for reform we have become one of the most bureaucratic confusing litigious societies on the planet it s almost an embarrassment be an American citizen traveling around the world and listening to the stupid s  we have to deal with in this country and at one point we have to get our act together. We won t do what were supposed to for the average Americans and unfortunately people write about this like corporations is not corporations competitive taxes are important for business and business growth which is important to jobs in wage growth and we should be making that along to every single one of you every time you talk to a client.VIA: CNBC',\n",
       " 'Over the last decade or so, a handful of people have become what you might call economic rock stars, at least for liberals. Robert Reich, Paul Krugman and Joseph Stiglitz grab the attention of liberals when they talk about income inequality, taking corporate influence out of politics and a more equitable tax structure.Bernie Sanders had talked about bringing on Stiglitz and Reich, if he were to win the presidency. In other words, these are men who have all the credibility in the world when it comes to evaluating political candidates and Nobel Prize winning economist Stiglitz believes that if Clinton wins, we are in for an even more liberal agenda than Obama has had.To be fair, Stiglitz is an advisor to Clinton s campaign, but he rarely tones down his progressive rhetoric, no matter who he s talking to or about. With Clinton, though, he gets quite specific in an interview with Slate Magazine. Stiglitz believes that in the years since Bill Clinton left office, the country has changed and that we are far more focused on income inequality, something he believes Hillary Clinton will do something about:Where do you situate Hillary Clinton ideologically in terms of economics?I think that s a good question. I think the world today is different from where it was 20 years ago, and the issues are being framed considerably differently. For instance, I think there s a recognition that inequality is a much bigger problem. I think she is much more concerned about more progressive taxes and dealing with tax avoidance of multinational corporations. I think she is very committed to that. I think progressives are not against trade, but they are concerned with trade agreements that are pushed by corporations, for their interests, by and for corporations. That is what we have in the form of TPP. I think it is a good thing that she has come out against that.Stiglitz also believes that the very fact that Clinton is pragmatic   something she s often criticized for on the left   will keep he on the right track:One of the progressive concerns about Clinton has been that the Clintons are enmeshed with this sort of global, financial elite through their foundation, and just through the circles they travel in.I understand those concerns, and I guess part of the answer to that is the reality of 2016 is that the Senate Banking Committee has people like Sherrod Brown, Elizabeth Warren, and Jeff Merkel, and you are not going to get through legislation that is a sell out to Wall Street. Knowing that, and knowing that she does not want to fight within her party, I think she is pragmatic enough. The criticism occurs because she s been, you might say, too pragmatic. The fact is she is pragmatic enough to know that these people will not tolerate the kind of sell-out that I think many people have seen in previous administrations. I think it is unlikely that we will get policies that stray too far from the progressive agenda.Stiglitz credits Bernie Sanders with Hillary Clinton s more progressive policies. As for Clinton compared to Obama:More conservative than Hillary, yes. I think his temperament is basically more conservative and he did not go as far on Dodd-Frank as many people wanted. He opposed some of the key provisions that eventually got in the bill.For those who are still worried that Hillary Clinton will take on the more neoliberal policies of her husband, remember that times have changed and that we are no longer a center right nation. If anything, we are center left, and Clinton knows that if she disappoints the growing progressive wing of the Democratic party, she is doomed to just one term.Featured image via JP Yim/Getty Images.',\n",
       " 'MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine soldiers killed nine Maoist rebels in one of the fiercest clashes since peace talks to end nearly five decades of conflict broke down in May, an army spokesman said on Wednesday. An army corporal was also slightly wounded in the 25-minute firefight in rural area of Nueva Ecija province, some 220 kilometers (137 miles) north of the capital Manila, army spokesman Lieutenant-Colonel Isagani Nato said. Nato said the soldiers rushed to the village after receiving a report of armed men in the area. Confronted by a band of around 15 guerrillas from the New People s Army (NPA), the soldiers killed nine. More than 40,000 people have died in the long-running insurgency, and peace negotiations have sputtered on-off. Talks, brokered by Norway, resumed in August last year, days after President Rodrigo Duterte freed senior communist figures and militants. A ceasefire agreement held for almost four months. But, Duterte suspended talks in January after rebels resumed and stepped up attacks on security forces, as well as on businesses in the countryside, including mines, plantations and construction companies. In May, the president scrapped peace negotiations saying he will only agree to resume talks if rebels sign a negotiated ceasefire, and stop recruitment and extortion. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Shortly after Donald Trump won the U.S. presidential election in November, Vice President-elect Mike Pence visited the country’s largest manufacturing lobby group, six blocks from the White House, to brainstorm about Trump’s legislative agenda. The conversation at the National Association of Manufacturers was friendly, with a lot of “give and take,” said Aric Newhouse, NAM’s senior vice president of government relations. The business group felt Pence spoke their language and that it would be full-steam ahead on long-sought goals such as simplifying the tax code and repealing Obamacare, President Barack Obama’s signature legislation that aimed to extend health insurance to cover more Americans. But over the past week, Trump has sown confusion about some of his legislative aims. He criticized a key element of his Republican Party’s tax plan, known as the border adjustment tax. He also seemed to muddy the waters on his promise of repealing Obamacare by calling for healthcare insurance for all. While NAM was not unduly alarmed, the episode highlights the challenge facing Pence, 57, who will serve as chief emissary to Capitol Hill for Trump after the New York businessman is sworn in as the 45th U.S. president on Friday. Pence spent a dozen years as a congressman beginning in 2001, forging a number of personal relationships, especially with conservatives. While he does not have a reputation on the Hill as a deal-maker, lawmakers, Hill aides and lobbyists describe him as affable and a good communicator who is respectful in his dealings with both friend and foe.  But the NAM experience shows that Pence’s biggest obstacle in striking deals in Congress may be Trump himself. That’s because people negotiating with Pence may not always know if he speaks for his boss. Pence and Trump are a study in contrasts. Where Trump is combative and chases the limelight, Pence, most recently governor of Indiana, is even-keeled and calm, a man described by Republicans and Democrats as articulate and upbeat. Few vice presidents in modern U.S. history have occupied the central role in legislative affairs that Pence will have. Former Vice President Dick Cheney cut deals and cajoled lawmakers for President George W. Bush, but Pence’s assignment may be broader. In Trump’s first 100 days in office, Pence will be “leading the charge” on a number of initiatives in Congress, such as rewriting Obamacare and overhauling the tax code, senior Trump  adviser Kellyanne Conway told Reuters. “He has the assurance and the green light to do so from President Trump,” Conway said. “He is a major part of every serious conversation and important decision that is made, especially when it comes to the legislative agenda,” she said. While Pence certainly appears to be part of Trump’s inner circle, it’s far from clear who is closest to the new president, or whether they will tend to agree with Pence. Even though Republicans control both chambers of Congress, Pence will need plenty of political finesse to rally the party’s sometimes unruly rank-and-file lawmakers behind Trump’s agenda, once it is more fully fleshed out. From the conservative Tea Party faction to the moderate Republicans, the party remains divided. Many Republicans differ with Trump on issues such as free trade and worry he might be too willing to spend money that could increase budget deficits. In his home state of Indiana during the 1990s, Pence honed his communication skills as a talk radio host. But his low-key style stood in stark contrast to many conservative radio hosts. He has called himself “Rush Limbaugh on decaf,” referring to the influential right-wing talk show host famous for his flame-throwing statements.  Pence, who was raised Catholic and later became an evangelical Christian, would sometimes host Bible studies in his office in the House of Representatives. Texas Representative John Carter attended those meetings and recalled that Pence “had a little setup of a radio station” there in a reminder of his former career. During Republican President George W. Bush’s administration, Pence firmly established himself as a fiscal hawk. He resisted initiatives that he viewed as government overreach, including the 2002 “No Child Left Behind” education reform that emphasized standardized testing as a way of gauging how well schools were doing in raising student performance. Pence’s staunch opposition to big government made him one of the “forerunners” to what later became the Tea Party, said Michael Steel, a former spokesman for House Speaker Paul Ryan’s predecessor, John Boehner. Republican Senator Jeff Flake, who served in the House with Pence during the 2000s, said the two of them fashioned themselves as self-appointed fiscal watchdogs. They kept a close eye on late-night sessions where other lawmakers would seek to get more government spending approved without anyone noticing. “Mike and I\\xa0would have to wait up all night and rush to the (House) floor and burst through the doors” to object to those measures, Flake recounted in an interview. “Somebody said at one point when we burst through it looked like the saloon doors in ‘Butch Cassidy and the Sundance Kid,’” Flake said, referring to the 1969 film about the two Wild West outlaws. Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a leading conservative voice, said Pence has been a role model for other Republicans on how to advance conservative principles without being hard-edged. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “I always remember the line Pence had: ‘I’m a conservative and I’m not mad about it’ ... It’s a line I’ve used many times, saying that Mike Pence always used to say that,” Jordan said. Pence calls Speaker Ryan, who has struggled with staunch conservatives in his caucus, a close friend. Their ties may help to smooth over some of the tensions that arose between Ryan and Trump during the 2016 campaign.  Cultivating Republicans won’t be Pence’s only job. If Republicans in the House of Representatives can rally around Trump’s agenda, Democrats will have few tools to block them. But in the Senate, Democrats can use procedural moves to stop legislation that does not otherwise have support from 60 senators. Republicans control 52 votes in the 100-member chamber. Pence’s smooth demeanor will go only so far given his ideological gulf with congressional Democrats. He has raised the ire of Democrats with his outspoken stance against abortion, his work against gay rights, his opposition to measures aimed at women’s pay equity in the workplace and his determination to repeal Obamacare.  Republican Senator Roy Blunt of Missouri, who was part of the House Republican leadership during the mid-2000s, said he expected Pence would stick to his conservative principles, even if they clashed with Trump’s. “I don’t think he’d be very effective arguing against his own feelings,” Blunt said. “But I think he’d be smart enough to go to the president and say, ‘I can be supportive of this because you are the president and I am the vice president, but I am not going to be a good salesman’” on that particular issue.

       " 'Donald Trump moved ever closer to securing the Republican nomination for President of the United States this week with victory in the Nevada caucus.There s no way around it   Trump thrashed his opponents in Nevada. He won a massive 45.9% of the vote, knocking Marco Rubio into 2nd place with just 23.9%, and Cruz in 3rd on 21.4%. It appears that the Trump campaign is unassailable at this point, although a week is a long time in U.S. politics.Graphic via GuardianPerhaps the darkest moment of the night was when Trump actually said these words in his victory speech: We won with poorly educated! I love the poorly educated! There were whopping cheers and applause for this comment. Which seemingly bore zero irony. He continued: We re the smartest people. We re the most loyal people. First things first: Donald Trump is not poorly educated. He attended the Kew Forest School until 8th grade before spending the rest of his schooling in the New York Military Academy. He later won a bachelors degree in Economic from the Wharton School of Business at the University of Pennsylvania. So, another total lie from this candidate.One reason  poorly educated  might appeal to Trump though, is that part of the education process is to give a person the tools to think critically about an issue, and to fact-check arguments. It is not to say you cannot have these skills without a decent high school education, but it s an uphill struggle. It s not impossible to save a person having a heart attack without having had medical training, but you d put your money on the doctor every time.So, now wonder Trump would like to keep America under-educated.According to leading fact-checking site Politifact, just 1% of claims made by Donald Trump are true. One percent! Meanwhile, 3 out of every 5 statements he makes are absolute lies. Let s take a look back at some of those lies:They just keep on coming.And on the matter of faith, Donald Trump is now claiming to be some sort of born again evangelical. Yet, Trump has been married three times, pokes fun of Holy Communion as eating  the little cracker , claims he has never asked God to forgive his sins in his life, and could not name a single passage of the Bible when pressed for his favorite piece of scripture.Trump is about as devout a Christian as Bill Nye.And yet, he is winning evangelical support in droves. Why? Because the evangelical, Christian Conservative movement has zero to do with faith in God, and everything to do with a fanatical conviction in right-wing principles of crony capitalism, white supremacy, homophobia and sexism.If this was not the case, Trump would be the LAST candidate that appealed to Evangelicals. To any right-thinking Christian, he is the 21st century incarnation of the Whore of Babylon.But Trump gets a pass for all of this, because under-educated people are having their ignorance exploited, and bigoted people are having their bellies tickled. This resurgent right is euphoric that it s candidate can say things on national television that have been outlawed in workplaces and public spaces for decades. They are thrilled that hate has been made mainstream by their candidate, and they are going to come out in their droves to support him.This means that voting in this year s election will be the most important ballots cast on American soil in a very long time. The reproductive rights of women, the rights of LGBT Americans, the rights of non-Christians, the rights of victims of rape and sexual assault, the rights of victims of gun crime, the rights of non-white Americans   they are all on the chopping block in this election.  Every American with a conscience and a sense of decency has the absolute duty to make a stand against this sh*tstorm of stupidity, bigotry and ignorance.  Featured Image via Screengrab',\n",

In an op-ed on his website, Reich explained his stance further.Trump s goal has never been to promote guns or white supremacy or to fuel attacks on the press and the left. These may be means, but the goal has been to build and fortify his power.

       " 'KABUL (Reuters) - American warplanes in Afghanistan are dropping bombs in numbers not seen since the height of the U.S. troop surge in 2010, after President Donald Trump announced a new strategy in August to ease attack curbs and widen the range of militant targets. In September, for example, the U.S. Air Force dropped 751 bombs, an increase of nearly 50 percent from the August figure of 503, to reach its highest single-month total in seven years, military data showed.  The increase can be attributed to the president s strategy to more proactively target extremist groups that threaten the stability and security of the Afghan people,  the Air Force said in a monthly report. Six more F-16 fighter bombers have been deployed to Bagram air field north of the Afghan capital of Kabul, and additional massive B-52 bombers have been assigned to strike Afghanistan from bases in the Persian Gulf, it added. The Air Force numbers exclude strikes by the U.S. Army, which maintains armed helicopters and other aircraft in Afghanistan. Trump s South Asia strategy included promises to expand authority for U.S. forces to target militants in Afghanistan.  These killers need to know they have nowhere to hide; that no place is beyond the reach of American might and Americans  arms,  Trump said in his August speech unveiling the strategy.  Retribution will be fast and powerful.  Former President Barack Obama s plans to drawdown the U.S. mission in Afghanistan often limited U.S. troops to attacking the Taliban only in certain circumstances, such as self-defense. This month, Defense Secretary James Mattis confirmed to Congress that those restrictions would be lifted under Trump s plan. ',\n",

It is ironic that they have not ruled out taking money from a candidate currently under investigation by the FBI. Excuses, excuses. It s like they re back in kindergarten and saying,  I didn t want to be your friend anyway!  in order to save face. And by all means, invoke the investigation into Hillary s email server to smear Buzzfeed and deflect attention from the real problem, which is Trump. That just compounds the flimsiness of their response.Earlier on Monday, Buzzfeed CEO Jonah Peretti explained in a letter that they won t accept Trump ads because Trump is dangerous. He compared Trump ads to cigarette ads, saying that they don t run cigarette ads for that same reason. They don t want to be seen as endorsing something that s fundamentally bad for them and for us.Peretti is especially concerned about Trump wanting to limit freedom of the press, ban Muslims and get rid of immigrants: The Trump campaign is directly opposed to the freedoms of our employees in the United States and around the world and in some cases, such as his proposed ban on international travel for Muslims, would make it impossible for our employees to do their jobs. They do intend to continue covering Trump, though, and their coverage is brutal enough for him to specifically target them at rallies and elsewhere. The RNC, though, doesn t want to look like they re sucking on sour grapes over this, but they can t avoid it now. Such a shame   our hearts bleed pink carbonated peanut butter for them.Featured image by Alex Wong/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - A sluggish forecast for U.S. economic growth as well as an increase in U.S. states’ Medicaid and pension contribution costs is creating a budgetary squeeze in many state capitols, according to a research report issued by S&P Global Ratings on Monday.  While the risk of a recession within the next 12 months has fallen into a 15-20 percent range from 20-25 percent, the rate of economic expansion “is expected to remain fairly anemic at 1.8 percent over the longer term (roughly 10 years), well below the 3.0 percent average growth rate that prevailed from 1980 to 2000,” the report said. “And while the risk that federal policy could trigger a recession has eased, the potential for a dramatic scaling-back of federal aid for Medicaid has never been greater,” the report said. The slow-growth economy is producing sluggish revenue trends for the states, said Gabriel Petek, an analyst at S&P, in a telephone interview.  S&P does not expect Washington will enact a federally funded public infrastructure package in the next two years, which will put further stresses on state budget management. Addressing deferred maintenance and inadequate capacity in public infrastructure will depend heavily on state and local government solutions, the report said. Without a possible bump in growth from a federal infrastructure package, projected GDP growth for 2017 was lowered to 2.2 percent from 2.3 percent, the report said. “Anything that is done at the federal level would imply that more of the burden has to be picked up by the state and local government level in the area of infrastructure investment,” Petek said. The report added that the U.S. mid-Atlantic region (New Jersey, New York and Pennsylvania) will have the slowest growing economy compared to other regions. Real GDP growth for the region is projected at 1.25 percent for 2017, the report said. The best performing region forecast for the current year, with an economic growth forecast of 2.88 percent is the Mountain region (Arizona, Colorado, Idaho, Montana, Nevada, New Mexico, Utah, Wyoming). Overall, regional economies growth rates are expected to peak in 2018 before some of those gains ebb, the report’s data showed. The best performing region forecast for 2018 are the states in the West South Central region (Texas, Oklahoma, Louisiana, Arkansas) with a combined growth rate of 3.36 percent, followed closely by the Mountain region at 3.29 percent and Pacific region at 2.93 percent.

This interview between Gorka and Camerota went from cordial to personal really quickly! Alison Camerota asked about Iraqi forces defeating ISIS to win back the city of Mosul. But Camerota couldn t help herself so she pivoted to the Trump-Russia fake news topic:Camerota goes partisan:  Is it possible that your team is obsessed with the Clintons? Gorka starts to get into with Camerota:  No. We d like you to actually do your job. You aren t in the news business anymore. You used to be. You are in the attacking President Trump business.

The amount of time you spend in desperation on a topic that has plummeted you to 13th place in viewership ranking across America, more people watch Nick at Nite cartoons than CNN today.

       " 'SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australia will not be allowed to walk away from legal, financial and moral responsibility for nearly 800 men when it closes its asylum seeker detention center in Papua New Guinea (PNG) on Tuesday, PNG s immigration minister said. Human rights advocates are warning of a looming humanitarian crisis when the Manus Island center closes if the men are not properly resettled, with hundreds of the detainees refusing to leave the center for fear of being targeted by locals. PNG Immigration Minister Petrus Thomas said late on Sunday that Australia will remain responsible for the welfare of the men that have been detained in the Australian-funded center for more than four years. Australia refuses to allow asylum seekers arriving by boat to reach its shores, detaining them in camps in PNG and Nauru in the South Pacific. The United Nations and rights groups have for years cited human rights abuses among detainees in the centers.  It is PNG s position that as long as there is one individual from this arrangement that remains in PNG, Australia will continue to provide financial and other support to PNG to manage the persons transferred under the arrangement until the last person leaves or is independently resettled in PNG,  Thomas said in an emailed statement. Australia has already said it would spend up to A$250 million ($195 million) housing the nearly 800 refugees and asylum seekers in Papua New Guinea for the next 12 months after its controversial detention center closes. The Manus center is scheduled to close on Tuesday, after being declared illegal by a PNG court, with 600 men set to be moved to three new transit camps. Just under 200 men have already relocated. Despite threats that basic services like electricity and water will be cut off, the remaining detainees are refusing to move, citing fears for their safety. Fears of violence have been stoked further after PNG sent extra security forces to the camp. The relocation of the men is designed as a temporary measure, allowing the United States time to complete vetting of refugees as part of a refugee swap deal. The United States has agreed to take up to possibly 1,250 refugees from Australia s two Pacific detention centers, but so far only 25 men from Manus have been resettled. In exchange, Australia said it will resettle Central American refugees. Australia has said those detainees not resettled in the United States will be allowed to stay in PNG or the tiny Pacific island of Nauru. But nearly all have refused invitations to settle permanently in both locations. Thomas said PNG will not force anyone to remain.  It is the responsibility of Australia to pursue third country options,  he said. Australia s acting Prime Minister Julie Bishop said on Monday that Canberra was exploring possible deals for resettlement, but added  those who have found not to be refugees should go home .  They ve been found by the (United Nations) not to be owed protection so they should return to their homes,  she said. The bulk of the detainees come from war-torn countries such as Syria and Afghanistan, and Pakistan, Iran, Sri Lanka and Myanmar. ',\n",
       " 'On Friday night, Megyn Kelly decided to weigh in on the protest in Chicago that sent Donald Trump packing. She, like must conservatives, accused the protestors of denying Trump and his supporters their first amendment rights. His First Amendment free speech rights have been shut down,  Kelly said.  The right of those to listen to him, and as that one gentleman put it so well:  I just want to hear him for myself, wanna hear him for myself.  That was shut down by folks who have an agenda and that s fine. You can oppose Donald Trump. Go for it. But, is this the way?  Kelly continues.  Is this the way to shut down the ability of Chicagoans and those, in some cases, who have traveled for miles and miles and waited for hours and hours to get in, to have their say and hear him for themselves. For all these people know, they weren t Trump supporters. Maybe they would have walked away saying,  You know what? He s not for me.  We ll never know now. Well, seems that Kelly has forgotten a very key component to the First Amendment. Freedom of assembly is a right granted to everyone. That means that the protestors had just as much of a right to go protest Trump, as Trump has a right to go spew whatever hateful rhetoric he wants.No one forced Trump to run away. The Chicago police did not advise Trump s campaign to cancel the rally. This wasn t a  safe space  for Trump and his supporters to preach hate against minorities and make jokes about how big their d*cks are, it was an event open to the public. The public showed up and let everyone know how they feel. Trump couldn t handle that.It s important to keep in mind that earlier that day on Friday, a Trump rally in St. Louis nearly turned into a full blown race war. When protestors show up and practice their right to freedom of assembly, they are met with violence from Trump supporters. If we are going to talk about denying people their rights, let s talk about the Trump Youth s use of violent intimidation tactics to shut down peaceful protest against their leader.You can watch Kelly s commentary below.Featured image via video screen capture ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A bipartisan group of 48 lawmakers in the U.S. House of Representatives on Friday asked the Obama administration to brief Congress “as soon as possible” about a 2015 Yahoo YHOO.O  program to scan all of its users’ incoming email at the behest of the government. The request comes amid scrutiny by privacy advocates and civil liberties groups about the legal authority and technical nature of the surveillance program, first revealed by Reuters last week. Custom software was installed to search messages to hundreds of millions of accounts under an order issued by the secretive Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Court. “As legislators, it is our responsibility to have accurate information about the intelligence activities conducted by the federal government,” according to the letter, organized by Republican Representative Justin Amash of Michigan and Democratic Representative Ted Lieu of California. “Accordingly, we request information and a briefing as soon as possible for all members of Congress to resolve the issues raised by these reports.” Investigators searched for messages that contained a single piece of digital content linked to a foreign state sponsor of terrorism, sources have told Reuters, though the nature of the content remains unclear. Intelligence officials said Yahoo modified existing systems used to stop child pornography and filter spam messages on its email service.  But three former Yahoo employees told Reuters the court-ordered search was done by a module buried deep near the core of the company’s email server operation system, far below where mail sorting was handled. The Senate and House intelligence committees were given a copy of the order when it was issued last year, sources said, but other members of Congress have express concern at the scope of the email scanning. Some legal experts have questioned the breadth of the court order and whether it runs afoul of the U.S. Constitution’s Fourth Amendment protections against unreasonable searches. Half of registered U.S. voters believe the Yahoo program violated the privacy of customers, according to a poll of 1,989 people conducted last week by Morning Consult, a polling and media company. Twenty-five percent were supportive of the program because of its potential to stop criminal acts, the survey found, while another quarter did not know or had no opinion. The congressional letter is addressed to Attorney General Loretta Lynch and Director of National Intelligence James Clapper. ',\n",
       " '21st Century Wire says Reframing the current diplomatic crisis in North Korea is essential if genuine progress is to be made in diffusing the current tense situation.Former US President Jimmy Carter is suggesting just that. But will the hawks in Washington listen?. The Carter CenterThe harsh rhetoric from Washington and Pyongyang during recent months has exacerbated an already confrontational relationship between our countries, and has probably eliminated any chance of good faith peace talks between the United States and North Korea. In addition to restraining the warlike rhetoric, our leaders need to encourage talks between North Korea and other countries, especially China and Russia. The recent UN Security Council unanimous vote for new sanctions suggests that these countries could help.  In all cases, a nuclear exchange must be avoided. All parties must assure North Koreans they we will forego any military action against them if North Korea remains peaceful.President Jimmy CarterI have visited North Korea three times, and have spent more than 20 hours in discussions with their political leaders regarding important issues that affect U.S.-DPRK relations.In June 1994, I met with Kim Il Sung in a time of crisis, when he agreed to put all their nuclear programs under strict supervision of the International Atomic Energy Agency and to seek mutual agreement with the United States on a permanent peace treaty, to have summit talks with the president of South Korea, to expedite the recovery of the remains of American service personnel buried in his country, and to take other steps to ease tension on the peninsula. Kim Il Sung died shortly after my visit, and his successor, Kim Jong Il, notified me and leaders in Washington that he would honor the promises made by his father. These obligations were later confirmed officially in negotiations in Geneva by Robert Gallucci and other representatives of the Clinton administration.I returned to Pyongyang in August 2010, at the invitation of North Korean leaders, to bring home Aijalon Gomes, an American who had been detained there. My last visit to North Korea was in May 2011 when I led a delegation of Elders (former presidents of Ireland and Finland and former prime minister of Norway) to assure the delivery of donated food directly to needy people.During all these visits, the North Koreans emphasized that they wanted peaceful relations with the United States and their neighbors, but were convinced that we planned a preemptive military strike against their country. They wanted a peace treaty (especially with America) to replace the ceasefire agreement that had existed since the end of the Korean War in 1953, and to end the economic sanctions that had been very damaging to them during that long interim period. They have made it clear to me and others that their first priority is to assure that their military capability is capable of destroying a large part of Seoul and of responding strongly in other ways to any American attack. The influence of China in Pyongyang seems to be greatly reduced since Kim Jong Un became the North Korean leader in December 2011.A commitment to peace by the United States and North Korea is crucial.When this confrontational crisis is ended, the United States should be prepared to consummate a permanent treaty to replace the ceasefire of 1953. The United States should make this clear, to North Koreans and to our allies.READ MORE NORTH KOREA NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire North Korea FilesSUPPORT OUR WORK BY SUBSCRIBING & BECOMING A MEMBER @21WIRE.TV',\n",
       " 'WOW! This is a powerful, must read letter that should be shared with every American Lately, I must admit that my hostility towards your political ilk has ramped up, pretty dramatically. No, it s not because we, at this point in my life, have a half-black president in the White House, and I m some closet racist who is becoming increasingly frustrated at the prospects of the White Man s power slipping through my fingers. I know that you ve accused our side of such nonsense, and the thought keeps you warm at night, but I can assure you that it is a comfortable fiction of which you should probably divest yourself.Now before I waste too much of your time, let s establish who I m talking to. If you believe that we live in an evil, imperialist nation from its founding, and you believe that it should be  fundamentally transformed , lend me your ears. If you believe that the free market is the source of the vast majority of society s ills and wish to have more government intervention into it, I m talking to you. If you believe that health care is a basic human right and that government should provide it to everyone, you re the guy I m screaming at. If you think minorities cannot possibly survive in this inherently racist country without handouts and government mandated diversity quotas, you re my guy. If you believe that rich people are that way because they ve exploited their workers and acquired wealth on the backs of the poor, keep reading. Pretty much, if you trust government more than your fellow American, this post is for you.First of all, let me say that we probably agree on more things than you think. Even between Tea Party Patriots and Occupy Wall-Streeters, I ve observed a common hatred of the insidious alliance between big business and big government. As Representative Paul Ryan (R-WI) so correctly noted, government should never be in the business of picking winners and losers in corporate America, and no person, organization, union, or corporation should have their own key to the back door of our government.Second, contrary to popular belief, conservatives really are concerned with the plight of the poor in this nation. You accuse us of being uncompassionate, hateful, racist, and greedy, but studies have shown that when it comes to charitable giving, conservatives are at least (if not more, depending on the study you read) as generous as liberals in caring for the poor. The difference between us is not in our attitude towards the problem   it s our attitude towards the solution. We believe that the government does practically nothing well (since without competition or a profit motive there is no incentive to do well) and has made the plight of the poor far worse than it would have ever been had government never gotten involved. For a stark example of this, look no farther than the condition of the black family in America since the  War on Poverty  began. You believe that more government is the answer, and that if we only throw more money at the problem, the problem will go away. We believe, as Reagan so aptly stated,Government is not the solution to our problems; government is the problem.Third, as people who might actually have to avail ourselves of a doctor s services at some point in our lives, we are just as concerned with the condition of America s healthcare system as you are. While we believe that America has the world s most capable physicians, has the world s most innovative pharmaceutical industry, and is on the cutting edge of medical technology, we also understand that the delivery system is far from perfect. However, unlike you, we see a grave danger in turning the administration of that delivery system over to the same entity that is responsible for giving us the United States Postal Service. There are private sector solutions that should certainly be explored before we kill the system, altogether, by giving it to the government to run.Now that we ve touched on a couple of points of common ground, allow me to explain my aggressiveness towards your efforts to implement your progressive agenda. First, let s talk about the word  progressive , since you now seem to prefer that word to  liberal . In order to label something as progressive or regressive, one must have some idea as to what constitutes progress. What is the ideal towards which you are striving? An idea is considered progressive if it moves us closer to the ideal and regressive if it moves us further away. So, what is your ideal society?Though I can t begin to discern the thoughts of every liberal who may read this, nor can I assume that every liberal has the same notion of an ideal society, in my arguments with liberals over the years, I couldn t help but notice the influence that FDR s Second Bill of Rights has had in shaping the beliefs of the modern liberal with regards to domestic policy. The rights that FDR cited are: The right to a useful and remunerative job in the industries or shops or farms or mines of the nation; The right to earn enough to provide adequate food and clothing and recreation; The right of every farmer to raise and sell his products at a return which will give him and his family a decent living; The right of every businessman, large and small, to trade in an atmosphere of freedom from unfair competition and domination by monopolies at home or abroad; The right of every family to a decent home; The right to adequate medical care and the opportunity to achieve and enjoy good health; The right to adequate protection from the economic fears of old age, sickness, accident, and unemployment; The right to a good education.At this point, you re probably screaming,  Right on!! , and who can blame you? What sane person in the world doesn t want everyone to be gainfully employed, adequately fed, smartly clothed, appropriately sheltered, and properly educated? These are the goals of every moral society on the planet, however we cannot ignore the fundamental question of,  At what cost? I m not sure whether FDR was a shallow thinker or simply a shrewd, Machiavellian politician, but the fact that he framed each of these ideals as a human right should be troubling to every freedom-loving person in America. After all, what does it mean for something to be a human right? Doesn t it mean that it s something to which you are entitled simply by virtue of your being human? Let s think about some of the basic rights that the real Bill of Rights delineates: freedom of speech, freedom of religion, freedom to petition the government, freedom to bear arms, freedom from illegal search and seizure, etc.If you re moderately intelligent and intellectually honest, you ll quickly see what separates the rights laid out in the real Bill of Rights from those laid out in FDR s misguided list   none of the rights listed above require the time, treasure, or talents of another human being.Your right to speak requires nothing from anyone else. Your right to practice your religion requires nothing from any of your fellow citizens. Your right to bear arms means that you are allowed to possess weapons to defend yourself and your family, but it makes no demand that a weapon be provided to you by anyone. A true human right is one that you possess, even if you re the only person on the entire planet   and it is unconditional.FDR s list is no  Bill of Rights . It s a list of demands. If I have a right to a job, doesn t that mean that one must be provided to me? If I have a right to adequate food, clothing, and recreation, doesn t that mean that I am entitled to those things, and someone should provide them to me? If I have an inherent right to a decent home, once again, doesn t that mean it should be provided to me, regardless of my ability to afford one or build one for myself?You might protest that FDR only meant that we have the right to pursue those things, but that s not what he said, and why would he? If we live in a free society, our right to pursue those things is self-evident, is it not? Besides, if he only believed in our right to pursue those things, he would not have felt the need to implement the New Deal.You may be getting anxious, now, wondering what FDR s Second Bill of Rights has to do with my antipathy towards your political philosophy. It s quite simple   your political beliefs are a threat to liberty   not just for me, but for my three boys and their children as well. I care much less about the America that I m living in at this very moment than I do about the one that I m leaving Nathaniel, Charlie, and Jackson.How does your political bent threaten my and my sons personal liberty, you ask? In your irrational attempt to classify things such as clothing, shelter, health care, employment, and income as basic human rights, you are placing a demand upon my time, my treasure, and my talents. If you believe that you have a right to health care, and you are successful in persuading enough shallow thinkers to think as you do, then it will place a demand upon me to provide it to you. If you believe that you have a right to a job, and more than half of America agrees with you, as a business owner, I am obligated to provide one to you, even if it means making my business less profitable.The fact is, you can rail against my conservatism all you wish. You can make fun of my Tea Party gatherings, and you can ridicule patriots in tri-corner hats until you wet yourself from mirth, but one thing is for certain: my political philosophy will NEVER be a threat to your freedom. If you feel a burning responsibility to the poor, conservatism will never prevent you from working 80 hours per week and donating all of your income to charity. If you feel a strong sense of pity for a family who cannot afford health insurance, my political philosophy will never prevent you from purchasing health insurance for this family or raising money to do so, if you cannot afford it, personally. If you are moved with compassion for a family who is homeless, a conservative will never use the police power of government to prevent you from taking that family in to your own home or mobilizing your community to build one for them.However, you cannot say the same for liberalism. If I choose not to give to the poor for whatever reason, you won t simply try to persuade me on the merits of the idea   you will seek to use the government as an instrument of plunder to force me to give to the poor. If we are walking down the street together and we spot a homeless person, using this logic, you would not simply be content with giving him $20 from your own pocket   you would hold a gun to my head and force me to give him $20, as well.Everything that modern liberalism accomplishes is accomplished at the barrel of a government rifle. You do not trust in the generosity of the American people to provide, through private charity, things such as clothing, food, shelter, and health care, so you empower the government to take from them and spend the money on wasteful, inefficient, and inadequate government entitlement programs. You do not trust in the personal responsibility of the average American to wield firearms in defense of themselves and their families, so you seek to empower the government to criminalize the use and possession of firearms by private citizens. Everytime you empower the government, you lose more of your personal liberty   it s an axiomatic truth.What angers me the most about you is the eagerness with which you allow the incremental enslavement to occur. You are the cliched and proverbial frog in the pot who has actually convinced himself that he s discovered a big, silver jacuzzi. Somehow, you re naive enough to believe that one more degree of heat won t really matter that much.I have the utmost respect for a slave who is continuously seeking a path to freedom. What I cannot stomach is a free man who is continuous seeking a path to servitude by willingly trading his freedom for the false sense of security that government will provide.I am reminded of Samuel Adams  impassioned speech where he stated: If ye love wealth (or security) better than liberty, the tranquillity of servitude than the animating contest of freedom,   go from us in peace. We ask not your counsels or arms. Crouch down and lick the hands which feed you. May your chains sit lightly upon you, and may posterity forget that ye were our countrymen!  Servitude can exist in a free society, but freedom cannot exist in a slave nation. In a free country, you have the liberty to join with others of your political ilk and realize whatever collectivist ideals you can dream up. You can start your own little commune where the sign at the front gate says,  From each according to his ability; to each according to his need , and everyone can work for the mutual benefit of everyone else. In my society, you have the freedom to do that.In your society, I don t have the same freedom. If your collectivism offends me, I am not free to start my own free society within its borders. In order for collectivism to work, everyone must be on board, even those who oppose it   why do you think there was a Berlin Wall?In conclusion, just know that the harder you push to enact your agenda, the more hostile I will become   the harder I will fight you. It s nothing personal, necessarily. If you want to become a slave to an all-powerful central government, be my guest. But if you are planning to take me and my family down with you, as we say down here in the South, I will stomp a mud-hole in your chest and walk it dry.Bring it.Jeremy N. Choateh/t Zero Hedge',\n",
       " 'During a segment of CNN s State of the Union, Arizona s Republican Governor Jan Brewer became very upset over accusations that Trump supporters, including herself, are being labeled as racists and bigots for supporting the GOP s presumptive presidential nominee.Last Friday, President Obama went after Trump in a speech where he referred to Trump as a  charlatan  going on to say that  we don t have time for bigotry or hatred. Brewer was questioned on how she felt about the president s characterization of Trump. She responded by saying: Obama just always comes tearing after Republicans constantly, calling names and calling people bigots and racists. And that s their big comeback, you know. And it s absolutely ridiculous. To see a president, speak like that is offensive. Former Democrat primary candidate and current governor of Maryland told Brewer that the President wasn t referring to all Republicans when President Obama made the remarks under discussion. O Malley did back up the president s comments, however, saying that: He [President Obama] did say it rightly that Donald Trump is a bigot, Donald Trump is a racist. Donald Trump is, in fact, making fascist appeals. That s why many self-respecting Republicans are not supporting Donald Trump. Brewer claimed that no matter what the topic is, Democrats refuse to talk policy and instead only want to sling accusations of racism and bigotry towards Republicans. The show s host Jake Tapper asked Brewer if she believed that Trump s proposals and remarks are at least somewhat racially motivated. Instead of admitting that it is possible, she simply blamed the things that Trump says that make her  uncomfortable  on his political juvenility.From there, Brewer descends into a full-blown freak out over accusations that Trump and his supporters might just possibly have racist motivations.You can watch the segment below.Featured image from video screenshot',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump asked then-FBI Director James Comey to end the agency’s investigation into ties between former White House national security adviser Michael Flynn and Russia, according to a source who has seen a memo written by Comey. The explosive new development on Tuesday followed a week of tumult at the White House after Trump fired Comey and then discussed sensitive national security information about Islamic State with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. The Comey memo, first reported by the New York Times, caused alarm on Capitol Hill and raised questions about whether Trump tried to interfere with a federal investigation. The White House quickly denied the report, saying in a statement it was “not a truthful or accurate portrayal of the conversation between the president and Mr. Comey.” Comey wrote the memo after he met in the Oval Office with Trump, the day after the Republican president fired Flynn on Feb. 14 for misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations last year with Russia’s ambassador, Sergei Kislyak. “I hope you can let this go,” Trump told Comey, according to a source familiar with the contents of the memo.  The New York Times said that during the Oval Office meeting, Trump condemned a series of government leaks to the news media and said the FBI director should consider prosecuting reporters for publishing classified information. Coming the day after charges that Trump disclosed sensitive information to the Russians last week, the new disclosure further rattled members of Congress. “The memo is powerful evidence of obstruction of justice and certainly merits immediate and prompt investigation by an independent special prosecutor,” said Democratic U.S. Senator Richard Blumenthal. Republican and Democratic lawmakers said they wanted to see the memo. Republican U.S. Representative Jason Chaffetz, chairman of a House of Representatives oversight committee, said his committee “is going to get the Comey memo, if it exists. I need to see it sooner rather than later. I have my subpoena pen ready.” In a letter to acting FBI Director Andrew McCabe, Chaffetz set a deadline of May 24 for the FBI to produce “all memoranda, notes, summaries, and recordings referring or relating to any communications between Comey and the President.” Republican Speaker of the House Paul Ryan backed Chaffetz. “We need to have all the facts, and it is appropriate for the House Oversight Committee to request this memo,” said Ryan spokeswoman AshLee Strong. Legal experts took a dim view of Trump’s comments, as quoted in the memo. “For the president to tell the FBI to end a potential criminal investigation, that’s obstruction of justice,” said Erwin Chereminsky, a constitutional law professor and dean of University of California, Irvine School of Law. “This is what caused President Nixon to resign from office.” But the experts said intent was a critical element of an obstruction of justice charge, and the president’s words could be subject to interpretation and possibly put into the context of other actions, like Comey’s termination. The fact that the president apparently said he “hoped” Comey would end the Flynn investigation rather than more directly ordering it “makes for a weaker but still viable case,” said Christopher Slobogin, a criminal law professor at Vanderbilt University Law School. Flynn’s resignation came hours after it was reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House weeks earlier that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for contacts with Kislyak before Trump took office on Jan. 20. Kislyak was with Lavrov at the White House when Trump disclosed the sensitive information. A spokeswoman for the FBI declined to comment on the details of the memo. An emailed fundraising appeal by Trump’s political organization and the Republican National Committee sent out after reports of the Comey memo said Trump was being victimized by an “unelected bureaucracy.” “You already knew the media was out to get us,” it said. “But sadly it’s not just the fake news… There are people within our own unelected bureaucracy that want to sabotage President Trump and our entire ‘America First’ movement.” The new development came as Republican and Democratic lawmakers pressured Trump to give a fuller explanation for why he revealed sensitive intelligence information to Lavrov. The information had been supplied by a U.S. ally in the fight against the Islamic State militant group, the officials said.  ',\n",
       " 'When President Obama announced his nominee to fill Antonin Scalia s seat on the Supreme Court, it took Mitch McConnell all of half an hour to announce that the Republican party would see to it that not a single meeting, hearing or vote would ever come of it in a purely toddleresque temper tantrum that not only scoffed at the Constitution and the president s executive authority, but at the American people, more than 60 percent of whom are uncomfortable with the high court in a 4-4 deadlock.McConnell has given every reason imaginable   other than a good one   why President Obama doesn t have the right afforded his office more than 200 years ago. His finest moment was when he admitted that NRA is running the show at Republican National Headquarters. Former McCain strategist Steve Schmidt said, Mitch McConnell s knee-jerk response after Justice Scalia s death is a public relations debacle for the Republican Party.  He s not kidding.According to a report from NBC, there are at least 16 Republican senators who have taken Mitch McConnell s directive to obstruct at even the common courtesy level and tossed it in the garbage where it belongs. Some are Republicans up for re-election in Blue States, like Kelly Ayotte from New Hampshire and Mark Kirk from Illinois, who will be the first to openly defy McConnell when he meets with Merrick Tuesday. Others are Republicans from red states who understand that it s better to allow the process to happen rather than prove to the American people that Republicans are incapable of governing effectively.Even with the moderates like Susan Collins of Maine and Jerry Moran of Kansas advocating for full hearings, the likelihood that Merrick would actually be confirmed is nearly non-existent, but that s not keeping GOP strategists from insisting that holding a hearing would seem much less obstructionist and rude. John Kasich, the last establishment candidate left for the GOP, has also said that Merrick Garland, at least, deserves the respect of a hearing. The man was, after all, nominated to fill a seat on the highest court ion the land by the President of the United States.That s the problem, though, isn t it? It s not that he was nominated, it s who nominated him. Republicans have become as predictable as they are reprehensible.Featured image by Alex Wong/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'The election is Tuesday. So it s time to make my final case for Donald J. Trump. My case is pretty simple   it s Trump or it s the end of America.I was raised as a middle-class kid in the greatest country in world history. A country built around mobility, opportunity and economic freedom. A country that allowed this son of a butcher to become a successful business owner, media personality, best-selling author and TV star and producer. Only in America.I was taught by my wonderful, patriotic, true red, white and blue, salt-of-the-earth, American parents that certain specific things made America great. Here they are:Faith in God, prayer, love of country, family, a belief in American exceptionalism, capitalism, Judeo-Christian values, the Constitution, limited government, personal responsibility, economic freedom, the military and police. Well don t look now. But everything from that list above   everything we believe in   everything that made America great   has been under full-scale assault for eight long years   from multiple directions. And Hillary is here to finish the job. She already publicly stated she wants to be Obama s third term.The truth is we either send a strong message heard around the world and elect Trump, or the America we know and love is gone. Forever.Because if Trump doesn t win, no other Republican will ever be elected president again. President Hillary Clinton will make sure of that. Hillary will open the borders like never before to let in millions of illegal aliens who have no love for anything that made America great.Foreigners come here not out of a love for America, but for a love of the cradle-to-grave welfare state that America has become. Eighty percent of them (or higher) will vote Democrat forever more to keep the welfare checks coming. That s Hillary s plan.Don t believe me? See California. No Republican will ever again be elected to statewide office. This was the exact formula that destroyed California. Open the borders, let in millions of foreigners, make them dependent on government welfare checks and then train them to vote Democrat to keep the handouts coming.It worked!That was the experiment. Now Democrats are onto Plan B   to turn the rest of America into California.Hillary will open the borders and tie the hands of border agents in order to flood the country with millions of new illegals. Hillary will legalize the 12 million to 15 million or so already here   and give them the right to vote.Hillary will also enthusiastically import millions of Muslim refugees who have no love for America, capitalism, the Constitution, or certainly Judeo-Christian values. Some will become terrorists, almost all will require cradle-to-grave welfare. Then it s over for America.So vote. Drag your friends to the polls. Make phone calls to your entire address book. Leave no stone unturned.Think of the U.S. Supreme Court.Think of open borders.Think of your children s and grandchildren s future.Then vote for Trump like it s   Trump, or the end of America.Because it is.Wayne Allyn Root is a best-selling author and host of  WAR Now: The Wayne Allyn Root Show  3 p.m. to 6 p.m. daily at 790 Talk Now.

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - With 11 days to go before the U.S. presidential election, Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton leads Republican Donald Trump by 15 percentage points among early voters surveyed in the past two weeks, according to the Reuters/Ipsos States of the Nation project. Though data is not available for all early voting states, Clinton enjoys an edge in swing states such as Ohio and Arizona and in Republican Party strongholds such as Georgia and Texas. An estimated 19 million Americans have voted so far in the election, according to the University of Florida’s United States Election Project, accounting for as much as 20 percent of the electorate. Overall, Clinton remained on track to win a majority of votes in the Electoral College, the Reuters/Ipsos survey showed. Having so many ballots locked down before the Nov. 8 election is good news for the Clinton campaign. On Friday, the Federal Bureau of Investigation announced that it is examining newly discovered emails belonging to Clinton’s close aide, Huma Abedin. Those emails were found on a computer belonging to Anthony Weiner, Abedin’s estranged husband, during an unrelated investigation into illicit messages he is alleged to have sent to a teenage girl. The Reuters/Ipsos survey was conducted before the news emerged Friday afternoon. It remains unclear whether the FBI inquiry will upset the balance in the race. The bureau disclosed nothing about the Abedin emails, including whether any of the messages were sent by or to Clinton. Over the summer, the FBI said it was closing its investigation into Clinton’s use of a private email system while secretary of state. Until Friday, her campaign seemed to have weathered the initial FBI email probe. Clinton has held a lead averaging four to seven percentage points in polls in recent weeks as the Trump campaign wrestled with accusations by women of groping and other sexual advances. Trump has said none of the accusations are true. He also struggled in the recent presidential debates and faced questions about his taxes. As of Thursday, Clinton’s odds of receiving the 270 Electoral College votes needed to win the presidency remained at greater than 95 percent, according to State of the Nation polling results released Saturday. The project estimated she would win by 320 votes to 218, with 278 votes solidly for the Democrat. Clinton’s lead among early voters is similar to the lead enjoyed by President Barack Obama over Republican Mitt Romney at this point of the 2012 race, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll taken at the time. Obama won the election by 332 electoral votes to Romney’s 206. But even before the latest email news, it had been a difficult week for Clinton. News coverage of Trump’s accusers had diminished, while Clinton confronted the almost daily release by WikiLeaks of emails purportedly hacked from her campaign manager’s account. This week’s leaked messages raised questions about former President Bill Clinton’s finances. And her lead in the States of the Nation project fell slightly from last week. Though the projected Electoral College votes hardly moved, the number of states solidly for Clinton slid from 25 to 20 this week. Trump didn’t see any additional states tilt solidly to him, but he did see some gains: The swing states of Pennsylvania, Colorado, Iowa and Nevada all moved from leaning to Clinton to being too close to call. Still, Trump’s path to a victory is narrow, and any realistic chance rests on his winning Ohio, North Carolina and Florida. As of Thursday, Ohio remained a toss-up. Florida and North Carolina were still tilting toward Clinton, according to the States of the Nation results. Early voting data for Florida and North Carolina was not yet available this week. In Ohio, Clinton led Trump by double digits among early voters. The project’s broader polling suggests the state is deadlocked between the two candidates. In Arizona, Clinton also was solidly ahead among early voters. In the past month, Arizona has gradually moved from a solid Trump state to a marginal Clinton state, although it is still too close to call, according to the project results. In Georgia, she enjoyed a similar lead among early voters. Overall, Georgia leans to Trump, but his lead narrowed to five percentage points this week, down from eights points last week and 13 points a month ago. Even in Texas, where Trump enjoys a sizable lead, Clinton has a double-digit edge among early voters, according to project results.

Now last Wednesday actually when they gave up on the 2st. 13-Year-old girls.Now after I have been contacted by a lot of people, even people who were there around when this happened.

Don t ever want to be with it again.I ve read about this stuff, and feel pity for the women, which is the reason why I ve written a lot about these atrocities and tried to highlight the problem because I felt and believe that you have to do something in order to increase the security of people, but especially for women, and Now, this has also happened to me personally. ?I didn t, I thought that I will stop by for a jog around the lake after work at night, through to stop the bike to the gym in the evening, stop by to go for long walks at night, I would have eliminated any risk for assault or molestation For not in my wildest dreams I would have been able to believe that a guy like that could happen during the day, in the middle of the day and also in front of people.This is not an okay behavior.It s not ok at all.',\n",
       " 'SEOUL (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump may travel to the heavily fortified demilitarized zone (DMZ) separating North and South Korea when he visits South Korea next month, the South s Yonhap news agency said on Tuesday, citing a defense source. The White House sent an advance team of working-level officials in late September to check candidate sites for Trump s  special activity  in South Korea, the source was quoted as saying. Trump was expected to send a significant message to North Korea, either verbally or  kinetically , during his first trip to the peninsula as U.S. commander-in-chief, the source said. The truce village of Panmunjom and the observation post, both inside the DMZ, were among locations Trump was considering visiting, the source said. Yonhap did not elaborate and the White House did not comment. Trump and North Korean leader Kim Jong Un have been engaged in an increasingly bellicose exchange of rhetoric, with Trump suggesting the military option was the only way to halt the North s missile and nuclear programs. A trip to the DMZ, following in the footsteps of his predecessor, Barack Obama, and Vice President Mike Pence, would bring Trump within yards of North Korean soldiers, who stand eyeball to eyeball with their South Korean enemies, and likely be regarded by the North as highly provocative.  In recent weeks, North Korea has launched two missiles over Japan and conducted its sixth nuclear test, all in defiance of U.N. Security Council resolutions, and may be fast advancing toward its well publicized goal of developing a nuclear-tipped missile capable of hitting the U.S. mainland. Trump repeatedly has made clear his distaste for dialogue with North Korea. Last week, he dismissed the idea of talks as a waste of time, a day after Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said Washington was maintaining open lines of communication with Kim Jong Un s government.  Our country has been unsuccessfully dealing with North Korea for 25 years, giving billions of dollars & getting nothing. Policy didn t work!  the U.S. president said in a Twitter post on Monday. Reclusive North Korea and the rich, democratic South are technically still at war because their 1950-53 conflict ended in a truce, not a peace treaty. The North regularly threatens to destroy the South and its main ally, the United States. Trump is scheduled to visit Japan, South Korea, China, Vietnam and the Philippines starting from Nov. 3.

       " 'STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Sweden’s Vattenfall will invest 3 billion Swedish crowns ($349 million) in a Scottish offshore wind farm that U.S. Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump tried to stop being built near his luxury golf course in Scotland. State-owned utility Vattenfall, which will take 100 percent ownership of the project from Aberdeen Renewable Energy Group, described its investment as a vote of confidence in Britain after the nation’s decision to leave the European Union. “The decision to invest ... comes only a few weeks after the British referendum on leaving the EU and demonstrates Vattenfall’s continuing long-term commitment to wind power in Great Britain,” the company said in a statement. Scotland’s First Minister Nicola Sturgeon has said she would not rule out the possibility of Scotland remaining in the EU. Sturgeon said that a second independence referendum is now a possibility, though she has also emphasized that another vote would not take place until it is clear that most Scots are in favor of breaking from the United Kingdom. Vattenfall said the wind farm will have capacity of 92.4 megawatts, which could potentially supply about 130,000 households with energy. It will also serve as a center for testing and developing new technologies for offshore wind power. In December last year Britain’s top court threw out a bid by Trump to stop the 11-turbine wind farm from being built near his multimillion-dollar resort. The Trump Organization had denounced the Scottish government as “foolish, small minded and parochial”. The Scottish National Party’s foreign affairs spokesman Alex Salmond replied that Trump was “three times a loser”. Construction is expected to start in the latter part of 2017, with the wind farm expected to start generating electricity in spring 2018. Onshore construction activity will start later this year.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Donald Trump will speak with House of Representatives Republicans on July 7 in what would be the first meeting of the party’s presumptive presidential nominee with its entire House caucus, Republican aides said on Tuesday. House Republican Conference Chair Cathy McMorris Rodgers announced plans for the meeting in a closed-door gathering of House Republicans on Tuesday, the aides said. Some House Republicans have publicly criticized Trump’s inflammatory comments about Muslims, immigrants and women, saying they risked the party’s chances of winning the Nov. 8 election. Speaker Paul Ryan, who has endorsed the real estate mogul, this month denounced the candidate’s criticism of a Mexican-American judge as textbook racism. On Tuesday, Ryan said banning Muslims from entering the United States is not in the nation’s interest, in contrast to Trump’s call to limit Muslim immigration. At the meeting with Trump, members will have a chance to “share their policy priorities, learn about his plans to unite the party; and get details about his plans to move America forward,” McMorris Rodgers said, according to an aide. During his previous visits to Washington, Trump has met with House Republican leaders and a number of lawmakers who support him but not with all members of the caucus. A Senate Republican aide said there were no schedules yet for Trump to meet with Republican senators. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Maryland, Delaware and Louisiana on Monday joined a growing number of U.S. states that have refused to hand over voter data to a commission established by President Donald Trump to investigate possible voting fraud. More than 20 states, including Virginia, Kentucky, California, New York and Massachusetts, have declined to provide some or all of the information that the panel requested, saying it was unnecessary and violated privacy. Republican Trump created the Presidential Advisory Commission on Election Integrity in May after making unsubstantiated claims that millions of people voted illegally for his Democratic rival, Hillary Clinton, in last November’s election. Calling the request “repugnant,” Maryland Attorney General Brian Frosh said in a statement that his office had advised the State Board of Elections that the commission’s request was illegal. The request “appears designed only to intimidate voters and to indulge President Trump’s fantasy that he won the popular vote,” Frosh said. The commission sent a letter to the 50 states asking them to turn over voter information including names, the last four digits of Social Security numbers, addresses, birth dates, political affiliations, felony convictions and voting histories.  Louisiana Secretary of State Tom Schedler said the presidential commission could purchase the limited information legally available to candidates running for office. “You’re not going to play politics with Louisiana’s voter data,” he said in a statement. Delaware Elections Commissioner Elaine Manlove said in an interview with Milford’s WXDE-FM radio that her office would not comply since some of the information was confidential. Manlove said she was working with the attorney general’s office to see if the request could be denied completely. Trump has blasted the states who have refused to turn over the data. He said in a tweet on Saturday, “What are they trying to hide?” Trump won the White House through victory in the Electoral College, which tallies wins in states, but he lost the popular vote to Clinton by some 3 million votes. He has claimed he would have won the popular vote had it not been for voter fraud. Civil rights activists say the commission will encourage voter suppression by justifying new barriers to voting, such as requiring identity cards to vote. ',\n",

       " ' AUSTIN, Texas (Reuters) - A punk rocker-turned-congressman from Texas announced his candidacy for the U.S. Senate seat held by Republican Ted Cruz on Friday, making him the first prominent Democrat to challenge the former presidential candidate.  Robert Francis “Beto” O’Rourke, a Spanish-speaking, Irish-American representing a predominantly Latino district that includes the border city of El Paso, is considered a long shot in the Republican-dominated state, analysts said.  MORE FROM REUTERS Connecticut may become first state to allow deadly police drones Wayward tabby returning to Denver home after 800-mile adventure British robot helps autistic children with social skills But O’Rourke’s outsider credentials are expected to add flair to the 2018 Senate race in Texas, where a Democrat has not won a state-wide election in more than 20 years. Beto is short for his name in Spanish, Roberto.  “This is Cruz’s to win. He has got a national fundraising network so he will have all the money in the world,” said Cal Jillson, a political science professor at Southern Methodist University in Dallas.  In a campaign launch from El Paso shown on Facebook Live, the Ivy-League educated O’Rourke, 44, pledged to fight for veterans, shun corporate money and serve only two terms in the Senate if elected, saying it was in the people’s best interest to have fresh blood in Congress.  O’Rourke, who played guitar and provided vocals for the punk band Foss in the 1990s, also took a shot at Republican President Donald Trump for his hard-line stance on immigration, vowing to “fight when necessary against a president who is focused on building walls, or conducting military immigrant round-ups.”  O’Rourke and Republican Congressman Will Hurd of Texas gained attention on social media earlier this month by live-streaming the journey they made together from Texas to Washington and billing it as 1,600-mile bipartisan road trip. They rented a car and took the trip due to a winter storm that shut East Coast airports.  Polls rate Cruz as the most popular politician in the state among Texans. O’Rourke does not have much political support outside his base of El Paso, a western Texas city closer to San Diego, California than to Houston.  Another possible challenger to Cruz is Democratic U.S. Representative Joaquin Castro, analysts said.  Just ahead of O’Rourke’s announcement, Texas Republican Governor Greg Abbott announced he was endorsing Cruz. Cruz backers later sent out a fundraising email, saying O’Rourke was out of touch with Texas values.  “Beto\\xa0O’Rourke\\xa0will have the full support of the mainstream media and a Washington establishment willing to do everything in their power to see Ted Cruz defeated,” the email said.

       " 'MOSCOW/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Angered by expanded U.S. sanctions, Russia on Wednesday canceled a high-level meeting between Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov and U.S. Undersecretary of State Thomas Shannon. The move cast some uncertainty over plans for the first face-to-face meeting between U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin on the sidelines of the upcoming G20 summit on July 7-8 in Hamburg, Germany. With two weeks to go, a senior White House official said no plans for a bilateral meeting had been finalized. “Nothing has been canceled because nothing has been set,” the official said. Moscow said it was obliged to cancel the diplomatic meeting after the U.S. government on Tuesday added 38 individuals and organizations to its list of those sanctioned over Russian activities in Ukraine.  The new U.S. sanctions were “a continuation of the trend set by the Obama administration aimed at ruining relations between our countries”, Ryabkov said in a statement posted on the website of Russia’s Foreign Ministry. U.S.-Russian relations have already been strained by allegations that Moscow interfered in the U.S. presidential election last year and Trump’s first five months in office have been dogged by a controversy over whether his campaign team colluded with Russia. Trump has said he wants to explore whether Washington and Moscow can work together on issues of mutual concern, such as fighting Islamic State insurgents in Syria. But tensions between the two nations have escalated. On Sunday, the U.S. military shot down a Syrian military jet. That prompted Russia to change its military posture. The Kremlin said the expanded U.S. sanctions undermined Washington’s assertions it wanted dialogue with Moscow, calling the new sanctions a “political gift” to Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko, who visited Trump at the White House on Tuesday. The U.S. State Department said it regretted the Russian cancellation, but remained open to future discussions to try to bridge bilateral differences. The new sanctions only reinforced existing sanctions, which have been updated twice a year since they were first imposed, the department said. “Let’s remember that these sanctions didn’t just come out of nowhere. Our targeted sanctions were imposed in response to Russia’s ongoing violation of the sovereignty and territorial integrity of its neighbor, Ukraine,” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said in a statement. The Kremlin said earlier on Wednesday that Russian forces were not present in eastern Ukraine, which is controlled by pro-Russian separatists.  The United States and the European Union have imposed several rounds of sanctions on Russian companies and individuals in response to Russia’s role in the Ukraine conflict. Lawmakers in the U.S. Senate last week also backed additional sanctions to punish Russia for alleged meddling in the 2016 U.S. election, its annexation of Ukraine’s Crimea region, and support for Syria’s government in the six-year-long civil war. Ryabkov was meant to be meeting Shannon in St Petersburg on Friday to discuss “problems in bilateral ties”. But Ryabkov, in the same statement on Wednesday, accused the United States of failing to propose anything tangible to improve relations. He said: “Previous multiple waves of American sanctions haven’t achieved the result which their initiators had hoped for. Any new attempts to make Russia ‘bow down’ will be just as futile.” ',\n",

Back in 2012, Pierson took to Twitter and lamented at the lack of  pure breeds running for president in reference to President Obama, who has a father of Kenyan descent, and Mitt Romney, whose father was born in Mexico.Perfect Obama's dad born in Africa, Mitt Romney's dad born in Mexico. Any pure breeds left? #CNNDebate  Katrina Pierson (@KatrinaPierson) January 20, 2012In her tweet, Pierson implies that having a parent born oversees somehow makes someone less American, or to put it in more eugenical terms, less pure.  That s interesting, since Donald Trump s mother was actually born in Scotland. One can easily infer why she would find Scotland more acceptable to be born in than Kenya or Mexico.Pierson is in agreement on all of Trump s policies, including supporting the ban on Muslims from entering the United States. She also advocates using America s nuclear arsenal in some capacity against perceived enemies saying,  What good does it do to have a good nuclear triad if you re afraid to use it? Katrina Pierson is not without a checkered history. She s been accused of collecting thousands of dollars in welfare benefits while working.  She also made a recent appearance on CNN where she wore a necklace made of bullets. After anti-gun advocates called her out, she promised to wear a necklace made of fetuses. Pierson also has an arrest record for shoplifting.  Ironically, four years before her wacky tweet, Pierson sued her previous employer for racial discrimination.Donna Pierson s antics and her checkered history shouldn t be surprising. After all, she s helping steer one of the most racist and frightening presidential campaigns in American history. Let s hope that the country can find a few good laughs with these crazies and put them all in the dust bin of history when the time comes.Featured Image Via YouTube Screenshot.\",\n",

       " 'The road to full equality for women has been long and it s been arduous, and we re still not there. Women are still not paid equal amounts to men for the same work in professions all across the nation. And to this day, women are still put down for their ambition, or seen as less than even if they hold superior experience and knowledge.One person who is definitely tired of this rampant inequality is President Barack Obama. He s been talking about women s equality since day one. He wants a nation where his daughters are treated the same regardless of gender. He wants their dreams to be just and big and bold as any boy s as they grow in to amazing young women.While speaking at the new Belmont-Paul Women s Equality National Monument, Obama stated: I want young girls and boys to come here 10, 20, 100 years from now to know that women fought for equality, it was not just given to them. I want them to come here and be astonished there was ever a time when women could not vote. I want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women earned less than men for doing the same work. I want them to be astonished that there was ever a time when women were vastly outnumbered in the boardroom or in Congress, that there was ever a time when a woman had never sat in the Oval Office . I don t know how long it will take to get there, but I know we re getting closer to that day, because of the work of generations of active, committed citizens. While this isn t a direct endorsement of any particular candidate, it does show the president s ongoing commitment to making sure women are treated just the same as men, no matter the job. And there was no greater place to bring this message than at the new Belmont-Paul Women s Equality National Monument.Thank you, Mr. President. https://youtu.be/vpwyV7Lc3FA?t=9m33sFeatured image via video screen capture',\n",
       " 'It s no secret that Senator John McCain hates Ted Cruz. Although he has tried to hide it by repeatedly calling the Republican presidential candidate a  friend,  it s hard to look past the time he called him a  wacko bird. He has also been very vocal about his disdain for Cruz s government shutdown tactics and in 2015 he said that he basically disagrees with the candidate s entire platform. With all of this in mind, it was really no surprise when McCain added his opinion to the Ted Cruz citizenship controversy.By now, you have probably all heard about Donald Trump questioning whether or not Ted Cruz was qualified to be president because he was born in Canada. The Constitution says that only a  natural-born  citizen can sit behind the desk in the Oval Office, and the GOP front-runner implied that he didn t know if Cruz was a legal candidate.During an interview on Wednesday on Phoenix radio station 550 KFYI s Chris Merill Show, John McCain said  he didn t know  if Ted Cruz was eligible to be president because he was born in Canada: I know that came up in my race because I was born in Panama, but I was born in the Canal Zone which is a territory. Barry Goldwater was born in Arizona when it was territory when he ran in 1964. .Asked if the Supreme Court might have to weigh in on the  natural born citizen  issue, McCain said,  It may be, that may be the case. It is likely that John McCain doesn t really question whether or not Cruz is eligible to be president; instead it seems as though he was trolling the senator a little bit. But if he does actually question his right to run, he may be trying to get the party to disqualify the Tea Party maniac.Although McCain has made some pretty stupid political decisions in the past (cough..Sarah Palin cough), he is basically a moderate Republican and not as loony as the Teabillies who have hijacked his party. That means he knows that even though the Constitution does not specifically define  natural born citizen,  the consensus is that if a person is born to American parents, even in a foreign country, they are  natural born. What s really funny about this whole non-scandal is that we are seeing the Republican Party target their own candidate in the same way many attacked President Obama   and he was actually born in the United States.Oh the irony Featured image via Salon',\n",

       " 'She wanted him to assimilate. She gave him a good job. She trusted him and offered the chance to prove he was willing to be a good employee. He slit her throat. There was nothing special or unique about Mohammad Hussain Rashwani, he was just another Muslim immigrant looking for a better life who had no interest in assimilating. Slitting his employer s throat is how Rashwani chose to show his gratitude for her trust in him.Mohammad Hussain Rashwani was hailed in the media as the  paramount example of successful integration  after he got a job as a hairdresser at a salon in Herzberg, Germany in late 2015.After a little over a year on the job, he decided to slit his female employer s throat.From Lausitzer Rundschau as translated by Gates of Vienna:  For me there weren t any signs that I could see Herzberg s hairdresser speaks about the knife attack by her Syrian employeeHerzberg s master hairdresser talks about what is motivating her these days since the attack by her Syrian employee two weeks ago.Should she have seen this attack against her coming? She keeps asking herself this question over and over. And she can t find an answer.  Even today, I do not know what I should think. Until that Wednesday evening, he was an endearing man. I believed up to the very last minute that something good could come of him because I appreciated his professional abilities very much,  Ilona F. says.The Herzberg woman doesn t want to talk about the attack itself; her thoughts are much more circling around  why  again and again.  Did I intervene too much? Was I too strong for him? Did we, my husband and I, organize too much for him?  These and other thoughts are constantly crossing her mind. But there weren t any signs that the Damascus-born Syrian maybe had other plans. His mother, which whom Ilona F. was in contact, had repeatedly written how grateful her son was for the chance that he received and how much he had respected the  she-boss .  He even assured my husband and me personally of this. Yet still, something had to have happened to him that made him commit this terrible bloody deed.  For me, there were no signs that something like this could happen,  the 64-year-old says, looking back. But, she admits, he had changed considerably in the past few months. Ilona F. explains:  We had invested a lot of time in him after our spectacular beginnings, and we had helped him in every way possible. We had plans. He is an outstanding hairdresser. The customers were super-happy with his work. Until the very last minute I had believed that things were going to work. Here s where the story that is all too typical of Muslim immigrants starts to take shape:Even then changes started to set in. He, a Muslim who until now did not seem in any way a devout believer, had began to talk about Allah more and more. This certainly got on her nerves for over time. He also quit visiting the hairdresser and her husband at home. Before the changes he came by almost every day. They had talked about everything, professional and private. But he had begun to neglect his study of the German language more and more.  He kept assuring me that he wanted to learn the language, but later. More and more he said later this, later that, when we talked about his future,  the businesswoman recounts.And then there were also problems in the salon. Mohammad H. came to work too late more often; he didn t take time very seriously. He became very reluctant to drive to work at Sch newalde, where his boss owned a second hair salon. And during the week the attack took place, he outright refused to go.After a disagreement in the Herzberg salon, when a customer was unhappy with the work of the Syrian hairdresser, she had given him notice that they had to talk.  I knew it couldn t go on like this. But immediately the question arose in my mind, what would become of him if I were to throw him out. After all, I still believed in him. That this by now was a fatal mistake is something the Herzberg woman is only slowly beginning to realize.  That I could have been so wrong in my judgment of another person,  she shakes her head.  Actually, I feel really sorry for him.   Information Liberation ',\n",

       " 'When Ellen DeGeneres found out that Donald Trump watched Finding Dory as his immigration ban was causing worldwide chaos, she used it as a teaching moment.On Friday, Trump signed an unconstitutional executive order banning people traveling from seven countries from entering the United States. International outrage ensued as people and governments around the globs condemned the ban and protests raged across the country.On Sunday, Trump watched the Disney/Pixar film in the White House as the protests continued and apparently learned nothing from watching it.So on Tuesday, DeGeneres told Trump what he should have learned. I don t get political, so I m not gonna talk about the travel ban,  DeGeneres began.  I m just gonna talk about the very nonpolitical, family-friendly, People s Choice Award-winning Finding Dory. DeGeneres explained that the character of Dory lives in the ocean near Australia, but she decides to travel to America to find her parents, whom she remembers after getting her memory jogged. Dory and her friends reach California, only to find a wall standing in their way and they proceed to do what is necessary to get around the obstacle.Finding Dory is about a fish named Dory and Dory lives in Australia. These are here parents. They live in America. I don t know what religion they are but her dad sounds a little Jewish. Doesn t matter! Dory arrives in America with her friends Marlin and Nemo and she ends up at the Marine Life Institute behind a large wall. They all have to get over the wall and you won t believe it but that wall has almost no effect in keeping them out.   Even though Dory gets into America, she gets separated from her family. Other animals help Dory   animals that don t even need her, animals that don t have anything in common with her. They help her even though they re completely different colors because that s what you do when you see someone in need. You help them.Here s the video via YouTube.Indeed, walls are a main obstacle throughout the movie, but the characters find a way to circumvent them every time, just as immigrants are going to circumvent Trump s massive and expensive wall along the southern border.As the Berlin Wall teaches us, people will find a way no matter how deadly the risks are.At least 5,000 people entered West Germany across the heavily guarded wall to escape the tyranny of the Soviet Union. 138 people died trying.If people are desperate enough, they will find a way to live in America. Travel bans and walls will not stop immigrants and refugees from seeking a better life for themselves and their families.Featured image via screenshot',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democrats’ liberal firebrand, Senator Elizabeth Warren, threw down the gauntlet to President-elect Donald Trump on Thursday, telling labor union members there are financial and social issues where her party will fight him and continuing to blast the Republican. Battling bigotry is the first job for Democrats after the election, said Warren, of Massachusetts, giving a sense of how her party will operate now that it no longer controls the White House and remains the minority in both chambers of Congress. “We will fight back against attacks on Latinos, African Americans, women, Muslims, immigrants, disabled Americans - on anyone,” said Warren, who sparred frequently over Twitter with Trump and criticized him on the campaign trail in the weeks leading up to Tuesday’s election. “Whether Donald Trump sits in a glass tower or sits in the White House, we will not give an inch on this, not now, not ever.” She said Trump had “encouraged a toxic stew of hatred and fear” and during the campaign “regularly made statements that undermined core values of our democracy.”  In the speech to the AFL-CIO labor federation, Warren also said Democrats will resist attempts to loosen financial regulation, “gut” the Dodd-Frank Wall Street reform law and eliminate the Consumer Financial Protection Bureau (CFPB).  “If Trump and the Republican Party try to turn loose the big banks and financial institutions so they can once again gamble with our economy and bring it all crashing down, then we will fight them every step of the way,” she said. Warren did highlight areas of agreement. She said “count me in” on Trump’s support of a new Glass-Steagall law to separate investment and retail banking, reforming trade deals, maintaining Social Security benefits, helping on childcare and college costs and rebuilding infrastructure. Warren rose to lead the liberal wing of the party during the 2007-2009 financial crisis. After Republicans blocked President Barack Obama’s attempt to appoint her as the first director of the CFPB, she won a seat in Congress.  In 2015, progressive groups and a political action committee pressed her to run for president. Since Trump’s victory on Tuesday, many have already renewed their calls, for the 2020 presidential election. ',\n",
       " 'Question: How do you see the future of Russian-US diplomatic relations in the context of the current atmosphere in Washington? Can you confirm that Secretary of State Rex Tillerson will come to Moscow in April?Maria Zakharova: Apparently, many volumes have been written about the development of Russian-US relations. I announced the release of the Foreign Ministry s yearend Diplomatic Bulletin and even showed it at the previous briefing.I believe that about 20 per cent of that bulletin was devoted to Russian-US relations, the way we see them, how we want them to develop, what we expect from Washington, what we are willing to do with the United States, the priority areas of cooperation, areas where our cooperation should be revived without delay and the areas where this can wait, at least for a limited time.This issue has been covered in interviews by Foreign Minister Sergey Lavrov, comments by Deputy Foreign Minister Sergey Ryabkov and in numerous statements made at all levels by representatives from various Russian agencies, political analysts and politicians, as well as officials from the legislative and executive authorities. We can talk about bilateral relations with a different degree of mastery, but we would like to start implementing our relationship at long last.We provided our views on bilateral relations and the reasons for blocking them under President Obama. We said that we were willing to work with the new US administration, under President Trump. I don t think we need to invent anything in this respect, because so much has been said before. Simply, we should start concrete practical work. We are ready for this.You know that we always invite our American colleagues and diplomats to join bilateral or multilateral dialogues on issues in which the United States has traditionally played a big and active role, such as Syria, the consultations in Astana and many others. We expect Washington to formulate its foreign policy approaches in the form of a concept. We are ready for pragmatic and specific work on the principles that we have described many times.As for the visit by US Secretary of State Rex Tillerson and the information about it, this is what I can say. It s not a secret that preparations for any visit include the coordination of the time when it can be announced. Visits by foreign ministers are public events that are never kept secret. At least, I don t know about any secret visits by foreign ministers in Russia or the United States. Preparations for such a visit also include the coordination of the format, agenda and the date it can be announced to the public.It is a matter of propriety and respect for each other s interests. One side proposes a date, and the other side is expected to accept it. This date should be acceptable to both sides, because the foreign ministers have packed schedules. The issue also concerns the coordination of the agenda by experts.One side informs the other side of the issues it plans to discuss, and the other side needs to respond that the agenda is acceptable. In other words, the sides need to reach agreements on many issues, after which they can announce an upcoming visit. This is how we work with our colleagues.To tell the truth, over the past few years we ve seen many strange things happen in Washington in connection with preparations for visits or talks by our foreign ministers. The US Department of State has more than once asked us not to announce planned visits until the last minute.This is not our tradition. We have been operating openly for years, but we have respected the requests we have received from our colleagues in Washington in the past few years. But what happened after that? First, the US Department of State asked us to keep the planned visit quiet and not to announce it until the last possible minute, until we coordinated the date.We did as they asked. But a day or two later the information was leaked by the US State Department and sometimes by the US administration. Frankly, this put Russia and the media in a strange situation, because they didn t know who to believe   the official agencies or the many leaks.It is difficult to say if this diplomatic communication is a US tradition or the latest technique. But it definitely doesn t correspond to our traditions. We believe that everything we coordinate should be made available to the media in accordance with diplomatic procedure. When we coordinate a visit and the date for announcing it, the information should be made public calmly and as agreed. This is what we do in relations with our colleagues from other countries.As I said, such cases in our relations with the US Department of State have become a bad tradition over the past few years. So, I can say in response to your question that we will make the date and format of contacts between the Russian and US foreign ministers public after we coordinate them. We won t keep them quiet.At this point, I don t have any information I can share with you. I can say that this visit and such contacts are possible in principle, but it would be premature to talk about timeframes.Also, I would like to say that if the practice of leaking information that concerns not just the United States but also Russia, which has become a tradition in Washington in the past few years, continues, there will come a day when the media will publish leaks about the things that Washington asked us to keep secret, for example, things that happened during President Obama s terms in office.Believe me, this could be very interesting information.Our American colleagues must decide if they respect the diplomatic procedure, if they keep their word on the arrangements made between us, primarily arrangements made at their own request, or we create a few very nice surprises for each other.Read more: Gateway Pundit',\n",
       " 'Bombs a-w oh, never mind Things must be going well in the  war on terror,  as the US Air Force just admitted that it is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS after  B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers.  As ZeeNews reports, Air Force chief of staff General Mark Welsh said as America ramps up its military campaign against the Islamist terror group, the Air Force is now  expending munitions faster than we can replenish them. The US Air Force is fast running out of bombs to drop on ISIS targets in Syria and Iraq after its pilots fired off over 20,000 missiles and bombs since the US bombing campaign against the terror group began 15 months ago, its chief has said. As ZeeNews reports, B-1s have dropped bombs in record numbers. F-15Es are in the fight because they are able to employ a wide range of weapons and do so with great flexibility. We need the funding in place to ensure we re prepared for the long fight,  Welsh said in the statement. This is a critical need,  he said.The bombing campaign has left the US Air Force with what an Air Force official described as munitions depot stocks  below our desired objective. The Air Force has requested additional funding for Hellfire missiles and is developing plans to ramp up weapons production to replenish its stocks more quickly. But replenishing that stock can take  up to four years from time of expenditure to asset resupply,  the official told CNN. The precision today s wars requires demands the right equipment and capability to achieve desired effects. We need to ensure the necessary funding is in place to not only execute today s wars, but also tomorrow s challenges,  the official said. As The Washington Times concludes, Russia has been bombing ISIS positions sporadically while France and Great Britain are now active in the American-led coalition which could relieve some pressure.Much larger potential adversaries like Russia or China most surely are following this development carefully. If the USAF cannot sustain a trickling battle against a poorly armed, medieval enemy, fighting a superpower military is obviously beyond its capability.Via: Zero Hedge',\n",

However, her message came with a chilling warning about the Trump administration as she said the progress that we fought for, that many of you were on the front lines for. It may not be as secure as we once expected.  Clinton blasted Trump: We may not ever be able to count on this administration to lead on LGBT issues. Then, she couldn t resist rattling off several of the things Trump has been doing to directly attack and weaken the LGBT community. She said: When this administration rescinded protections for transgender students, my heart broke. When I learned about the proposed cuts in funding for HIV and AIDS research, I thought about all of our efforts to try and achieve an AIDS-free generation. Some of the changes that we re seeing should seem small, but they matter a great deal if you re the person affected. Others carry historic significance, like the future of the Supreme Court. While Clinton was not always a supporter of same-sex marriage, she had changed her tone several years ago and has been a powerful ally since. In her usual classy way, she called on Americans to stick together and unite to protect human rights and resist homophobia. Clinton said: I know the election hit a lot of us hard. I can tell you this: Even when it feels tempting to pull the covers over your heads, please keep going. Clinton s skilled and powerful delivery is something that Trump could only dream to emulate one day. Despite having lost the election to Trump, the majority of Americans still love and support Clinton, as Trump s approval rating plummets by the day. The support for her message shows that America no longer supports the values of the GOP any longer, and that conservatives have made a major mistake by putting Trump in the White House.You can watch Clinton s speech below: Featured image via Drew Angerer and Mark Wilson / Getty Images',\n",
       " 'BERLIN (Reuters) - Frauke Petry, the former co-leader of the far right Alternative for Germany (AfD), will unveil her new  Blue Party  on Friday, promising a  reasonable conservative  agenda that would appeal to a broad base of Germans, she told a newspaper group. Petry, a 42-year-old chemist, was for a time the most visible face of the AfD, helping to build the public appeal that saw it win 12.6 percent of the vote last month and become the first far right group in the German parliament since the 1960s. But although she has long espoused strong anti-immigrant views, she berated other leading figures in the AfD for holding positions too far outside the mainstream and making it impossible for the party to join a coalition government. During the months leading up to the election she took a lower profile role in campaigning, all but vanishing from TV screens as more radical figures became the party s public faces. She won a seat in parliament on the AfD s list last month, but quit the party the next day in a surprise announcement at its victory press conference, pledging to sit in parliament initially as an independent. She told RND newspaper group in an interview published late on Thursday that she would hold a small initial event to announce her new Blue Party on Friday in her home state of Saxony in the former communist East. More rallies would follow around the country from November under the banner of  Blue Change  or  Blaue Wende , she said. Wende is the term widely used to describe the dramatic shift in German society after the fall of the Berlin Wall in 1989.  Blue stands for conservative, but also liberal policies in Germany and in Europe,  she told RND, adding that her new group would seek to replicate the success of the Christian Social Union (CSU), the Bavarian sister party of Chancellor Angela Merkel s conservatives, on a national level. The CSU, part of Merkel s conservative bloc in parliament, has taken a harder line than Merkel s own Christian Democratic Union over immigration, but fields candidates only in Bavaria, a state that accounts for 15 percent of Germany s population.   Every third German would like a reasonable, conservative political offering,  she said, adding that many frustrated voters had supported the pro-business Free Democrats, the AfD or  Merkel s CDU on Sept. 24 for lack of a better alternative. Petry said she had begun working on plans for her new party as early as August, after AfD members refused to accept her more moderate proposals at a party congress in Cologne. RND said German election authorities listed the new party as having been founded on Sept. 17, a week before the vote. Petry defended her decision to quit the AfD while keeping her seat won on its list, saying she would remain loyal to her voters.  The mandate doesn t belong to the party, even if it was won with party funds,  she said. The AfD is ostracized by all other parties, which refuse to work with it. None even wants to sit next to the AfD in parliament. ',\n",

       " 'MEXICO CITY (Reuters) - The Mexican government on Thursday said it had declared the North Korean ambassador to Mexico persona non grata in protest at the country s nuclear tests, an unusually firm step that moved it closely into line with Washington. In a statement, the government said it had given Kim Hyong Gil 72 hours to leave Mexico in order to express its  absolute rejection  of North Korea s recent nuclear activity, describing it as a grave threat to the region and the world. Mexico has traditionally sought to steer clear of diplomatic ructions, but in the past few months it has adopted robust language to condemn the governments of Venezuela and North Korea as they descended into increasing international isolation. Facing a rocky relationship with U.S. President Donald Trump due to his threats to tear up the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA), Mexico has backed him diplomatically on issues that imply no great political cost for the government.  North Korea s nuclear activity is a serious risk for international peace and security and represents a growing threat to nations in the region, including fundamental allies of Mexico like Japan and South Korea,  the Mexican government said. Mexico s step follows a tide of international condemnation of North Korea for repeated missile launches in recent weeks that intensified again following a nuclear test on Sunday. An official at the Mexican foreign ministry noted, however, that President Enrique Pena Nieto s government was not breaking diplomatic ties with North Korea. ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON/MANILA (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State John Kerry is confident after speaking to his Philippine counterpart that the two countries can “work through” a period of confusion caused by anti-American rhetoric from President Rodrigo Duterte, the State Department said on Monday. State Department spokesman John Kirby said Kerry expressed concern in his conversation on Sunday with Foreign Minister Perfecto Yasay about the tone of remarks by the Philippine president, who has sharply criticized President Barack Obama and talked of separation from Washington. At the same time, Kerry emphasized strong and stable ties between the longtime allies, while Kirby said Washington had seen no practical action by Manila to move away from those. Kerry’s conversation with Yasay came after Duterte provoked alarm last week by announcing a “separation” from the United States and realignment with China during a visit to Beijing. Although Duterte said later he did not really mean separation, his remarks added to concerns about the future of a U.S.-Philippine military cooperation pact seen as crucial to projecting U.S. power in Asia in the face of fast-rising China. Earlier on Monday, the most senior U.S. diplomat for Asia,  Assistant Secretary of State for East Asia Daniel Russel, said in Manila that Washington remained a “trusted” ally to the Philippines and supported its blossoming ties with China. Russel was the first high-level visitor from Washington since Duterte’s remarks and Kirby said that both Russel and Kerry made clear the United States had every intention of continuing to meet its security commitments to the Philippines. “The tone and tenor of the discussions that they had ... and the assurances that the Philippine side gave to their commitment to keeping the relationship going was enough to lead the secretary and the assistant secretary to believe that we were going to be able to work through this,” Kirby told a regular news briefing.  In his comments to reporters, Russel said he had candidly told Yasay that Manila’s friends were concerned about the high loss of life in Duterte’s campaign against drugs and reiterated the importance of due process. Russel said “a real climate of uncertainty about the Philippines’ intentions had created consternation in many countries,” including the United States. He said that worry extended beyond governments to corporate boardrooms and warned that it was “bad for business” in “a very competitive region.” Since Duterte took office on June 30, he has been scathing about U.S. criticism of his anti-drug campaign, in which about 2,300 people have been killed. But his ministers have repeatedly sought to soften his more outspoken remarks. Explaining Duterte’s “Goodbye America” remarks, Yasay said on Saturday the United States remained the “closest friend” of the Philippines but that Manila wanted to break away from a “mindset of dependency and subservience” and forge closer ties with other nations. Russel said Duterte himself had “already walked back” his remarks and added that Washington supported direct dialogue and negotiations between the Philippines and China. “We don’t want countries to have to choose between the U.S. and China,” he said.

       " 'LUXEMBOURG/LONDON (Reuters) - The European Union told Britain on Tuesday it must make more concessions in talks over its departure from the bloc, offering little hope of a breakthrough for Prime Minister Theresa May at a summit later this week. May traveled to Brussels on Monday for dinner with senior EU officials, hoping to nudge the Brexit talks forward to look at future ties which she says will help London make advances on calculating a financial settlement. But hours after the dinner, ministers from EU countries, even those such as the Netherlands that have much to lose if there is no Brexit deal, said May needed to go further on detailing how much Britain will pay when it leaves the bloc. After losing her governing Conservatives  majority in a June election and struggling through the party s annual conference, May has little room for maneuver   unable to increase her offer on the Brexit bill for fear of angering her own party.  We, the 27 together, find it extremely important that substantial progress is made on all three areas,  Dutch Foreign Minister Bert Koenders told reporters. But he also said the EU would offer May an olive branch at their summit on Friday by saying they would start preparing among themselves for talks on a post-Brexit transition in order to be able to engage with Britain swiftly after London delivers.  I hope that in the UK the reality comes in that this is a possibility to come to the next stage in December,  Koenders said in Luxembourg where ministers were preparing for the summit this Thursday and Friday. After the Brussels dinner on Monday, May and European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker said the pace of Brexit negotiations should be stepped up after they stalled largely over the size of the divorce bill. The EU s chief Brexit negotiator Michel Barnier struck a note of caution on Tuesday.  It takes two to accelerate,  he told reporters as he arrived to brief EU ministers in Luxembourg.  One step after another... We are not finished with the first step.  Neither side signaled there would be much movement at the EU summit after five rounds of talks, and some EU ministers in Luxembourg on Tuesday said it was hard to negotiate with a prime minister under pressure from Brexit hardliners.  Sometimes it s very difficult to see and understand what Britain really wants from these negotiations,  said Finland s deputy minister, Samuli Virtanen.  It seems that at the moment EU 27 is more unanimous than UK 1.  With only 17 months before Britain leaves, the lack of progress in the talks have prompted companies to get ready not only for London leaving without a deal but also for a prolonged lack of certainty which makes investment decisions difficult. Britain s Brexit minister David Davis said separately that London had no plans to walk away from the negotiations and that he hoped the looming EU summit would  build on the momentum and spirit of cooperation we now have.  At the summit in Brussels on Thursday and Friday, May is due to set out Britain s Brexit position and then leave the room as the other EU leaders discuss the progress of the talks to unravel more than 40 years of union. According to a draft of the conclusions for the summit, the EU are unlikely to agree with May that it is time to move the talks forward, but will instead suggest starting a discussion on transition among themselves. That comes after May also talked on the phone with German Chancellor Angela Merkel and French President Emmanuel Macron in recent days, with sources saying both Paris and Berlin rebuffed her advances and stuck to the EU line. Foreign minister Boris Johnson told the British parliament on Tuesday he hoped  our friends and partners  in the EU would discuss the transition period, saying  if we re going to get on to that kind of question, now is the time for them to do so . British officials have increasingly accepted that Friday will not bring the breakthrough they had hoped for, but believe an improved tone may mean that might not be too far off.  The PM is pleased with how the dinner went, it was productive, it was a friendly discussion,  a May spokesman said.  We have been absolutely clear that we can only resolve the financial implications of the UK s withdrawal and other issues as part of the settlement of all the issues.  But members of her party have reduced May s room for maneuver, with some Brexit campaigners saying if there was no progress on Friday, the prime minister should walk away.  It s all about the money and if she ups the bid now, that is a really hard sell politically,  a senior source in May s governing Conservative Party told Reuters. ',\n",
       " 'After years of investigating Hillary Clinton over Benghazi despite her resignation, Republicans are hypocritically refusing to investigate Michael Flynn.Donald Trump s national security adviser Michael Flynn resigned late on Monday night after getting busted for negotiating with the Russians while President Obama was still in office.Flynn s actions violated the Logan Act, which bars citizens from negotiating with foreign powers. Flynn s connections with Vladimir Putin run deep, and the Justice Department warned Trump last month that Flynn was at risk of being blackmailed by the Russians. Still, Trump kept Flynn on his team and even let him continue participating in meetings.Flynn, the national security adviser, was literally a national security threat and Trump refused to act.This comes months after an election that was tainted by interference from the Russians, and Republicans have yet to investigate that.And they are not going to investigate the Flynn scandal either.GOP Rep. Jason Chaffetz told reporters on Tuesday,  I think that situation has taken care of itself. I think he did the right thing stepping down. By that logic, the Benghazi investigation should have ended after Clinton stepped down as Secretary of State in February 2013. But Republicans continued the investigation into December 2016.Chaffetz then passed the buck by claiming that the House Intelligence Committee is responsible for investigating Flynn, not the Oversight Committee.When asked by reporters if he would launch an investigation, House Intelligence Committee Chairman Devin Nunes said he doesn t plan to do so and even went on to praise Flynn in the hope that the scandal will be swept under the rug.Here s the lawmaker who should be investigating Flynn and Trump s Russia ties, House Intel Chair Devin Nunes.Really taking this seriously. pic.twitter.com/ygfiajpYq3  Matt Fuller (@MEPFuller) February 14, 2017And so, Republicans once again demonstrate that they are complete hypocrites.Republicans like Chaffetz spent years and wasted millions of taxpayer dollars to investigate Hillary Clinton over Benghazi. It was a witch hunt that went beyond the amount of time Congress spent investigating 9/11 and in the end it found nothing.Republicans literally accused Clinton of  national security malpractice  even though it was their cuts of diplomatic security funding that played a role in the lack of security at the consulate.Nothing Hillary Clinton could have done in response would have saved the four Americans who died in the attack. Furthermore, there have been even deadlier terrorist attacks against American embassies overseas that did not result in investigations, especially when such attacks occurred under Republican administrations.But Michael Flynn broke the law, lied about his phone calls with the Russian ambassador, and was a national security threat because of his closeness to the Russians, particularly Putin, and was at risk of being blackmailed.This is a major scandal of the Trump administration and the American people are demanding a lengthy and thorough investigation by Congress. The fact that Republicans don t want to do it shows how little credibility these lawmakers have. They don t really care about our national security. They only care about launching investigations for political gain.They are hypocrites and they should be ousted from office in favor of people who will conduct a proper investigation into this matter. And when that investigation exposes Trump s collusion with Russia we ll all know why Republicans didn t want to investigate Flynn. Because protecting the party is more important to them than protecting America.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. lawmakers, alarmed that foreign entities used the internet to influence last year’s election, introduced legislation on Thursday to extend rules governing political advertising on television, print and radio to also cover social media like Facebook Inc (FB.O). Democratic Senators Amy Klobuchar and Mark Warner and Republican John McCain introduced the “Honest Ads Act,” one of the strongest efforts in Congress yet to address allegations of Russian meddling in the 2016 presidential campaign. The legislation would expand existing election law covering television and radio outlets to apply to paid internet and digital advertisements on platforms like Facebook, Twitter Inc (TWTR.N) and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google.  “Our laws have failed to keep up with evolving technology and the capabilities of our foreign adversaries,” Klobuchar told a news conference. The measure would also require digital platforms with at least 50 million monthly views to maintain a public file of all electioneering communications purchased by anyone spending more than $500. And it would require online platforms to make “all reasonable efforts” to ensure that foreign individuals and entities are not buying political advertisements to influence the U.S. electorate. Companion legislation was introduced in the House of Representatives by Republican Representative Mike Coffman and Democrat Derek Kilmer. Social media companies have become an increasing focus of congressional investigations into allegations that Russia sought to meddle in the 2016 U.S. election on behalf of Republican candidate Donald Trump, something now-President Trump and Moscow deny. Warner, who was a technology executive before entering politics, said $150,000 of ads paid for in rubles may be only the “tip of the iceberg” in terms of how many political advertisements were bought by foreign firms. He said advertisements could have been purchased using dollars, euros or pounds. U.S. law bars foreigners from spending money to attempt to influence American elections. Warner and Klobuchar acknowledged that the companies have resisted the legislation. But Warner said, “It’s our hope that the social media companies and platform companies will work with us.” It was not immediately clear how much support the act would receive in Congress or when it might come up for a vote. Social media companies have begun a lobbying campaign to at least influence, if not prevent, the bill. The companies said they are open to working with Congress and have been turning over information, but are legally obligated to protect their users’ privacy. Facebook has turned over thousands of ads to congressional investigators and its chief operating officer, Sheryl Sandberg, met with members of Congress last week. Google said it was look at steps it could take on its various platforms and would work closely with Congress, the Federal Election Commission and the industry to come up with solutions. “We support efforts to improve transparency, enhance disclosures and reduce foreign abuse,” Google spokeswoman Riva Sciuto said in an emailed statement.  Klobuchar and Warner said it was possible the measure could be offered an amendment to another larger piece of legislation. Warner is vice chairman of the Senate Intelligence Committee, one of the congressional panels investigating the alleged Russian hacking and the possibility that Trump’s campaign colluded with Moscow. Klobuchar is the ranking Democrat on the Senate Rules Committee, which helps oversee elections. And McCain is chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee. They said they would like it to become law by early next year, well ahead of the November 2018 U.S. mid-term elections, in which every seat in the 435-member House and about one third of the 100-seat Senate will be up for grabs Many lawmakers and other U.S. officials have said they fear Russian efforts to meddle in those polls as well. Separately, Facebook, Twitter and Google said Thursday they would send their general counsels to testify Nov. 1 before public hearings of the Senate and House Intelligence Committees. General counsel Colin Stretch will be the Facebook representative to testify before both committees, company spokesman Andy Stone said. The company’s high-profile Chief Executive Officer Mark Zuckerberg and COO Sandberg will not appear. A Twitter spokeswoman said Acting General Counsel Sean Edgett will represent the microblogging site. A Google spokeswoman said General Counsel Kent Walker would represent that company. ',\n",

Paul Ryan, leading member of the Ayn Rand cult of hating the poor, has had a change of heart!Via Raw Story: There was a time when I would talk about a difference between  makers  and  takers  in our country, referring to people who accepted government benefits. But as I spent more time listening, and really learning the root causes of poverty, I realized I was wrong. A Republican admitting they were wrong about ANYTHING is like finding a four leaf clover in the Sahara. Finding a Republican that admits they were wrong to demonize the poor in America is like finding one on the Moon. But Ryan wasn t done, he made it absolutely clear what he meant: Takers  wasn t how to refer to a single mom stuck in a poverty trap, just trying to take care of her family. Most people don t want to be dependent. And to label a whole group of Americans that way was wrong. I shouldn t castigate a large group of Americans to make a point. So I stopped thinking about it that way and talking about it that way. But I didn t come out and say all this to be politically correct. I was just wrong. While I WANT to believe that Ryan had a true Come To Jesus moment, I don t believe for a second that he didn t understand the root causes of poverty. He just didn t care until Trump threatened to utterly annihilate the Republican Party by telling the base that the rich don t give a damn about them.A few days ago, I wrote about the National Review, the right s premiere collection of thought leaders, dropping the pretense that the right-wing elites consider the rural poor to be the  real America.  Years of pent up hostility and derision come flooding out like a tidal wave of scorn. I wondered if this meant that the Republican coalition of the poor and the rich was finally ending. But then how would the rich hold on to power without their useful idiots to vote for them?Ryan s sudden reversal on poverty suggests that while the National Review is giving up on the poor, the Republican Party itself is not. By finally talking about poverty instead of spewing hate at the poor, Republicans may finally be ready to address the actual problem instead of simply trying to sweep it under the rug. They ll have to if they want to reclaim their base from Trump.It would be the absolute height of irony if Donald Trump forced the Republican Party to move away from the fringe in order to start governing responsibly again.Featured image via AI archives ',\n",

The ruling junta, faced with weak exports and sluggish domestic demand, has focused on promoting investment to help revive growth in Southeast Asia s second-largest economy, which lags regional peers. The military government hopes the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) development project, worth 1.5 trillion baht ($45 billion), will lift growth to about 5 percent a year by 2020, from the latest government estimate of 3.5 for 2017.  Regardless of which government is in office, or when the election will be held, the EEC plan will continue, with certainty,  Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha told a gathering of 570 investors flown in from Japan.   It is law, an act embedded within the 20-year national strategy, and supported by the national development plans.  The junta has branded its 20-year strategy a guide for policymaking long after elections expected next year, at the earliest. The strategy has fueled concern among critics that the army plans to cement its grip on power, whoever wins an election. Japan was Thailand s biggest investor in 2016 with more than 57 billion baht ($1.7 billion), most of it going into the automobile industry. Thailand, known as the  Detroit of Asia,  is a regional base for some of the world s top carmakers, such as Toyota Motor Co.

       " 'WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s ruling PiS party and President Andrzej Duda say they are closer to a compromise on overhauling the judiciary, an issue that has divided the once close political allies and worried the European Union.  In July Duda, who was backed by PiS, the Law and Justice party, in the 2015 presidential election, unexpectedly vetoed the ruling party s judicial reform proposals following nationwide protests and warnings from Poland s Western allies about politicization of the courts. The veto raised questions about whether PiS would uphold its support for Duda in the next presidential election.  In September the president made counter-proposals which still envisaged greater political control over the courts but to be exercised by the president and not by the justice minister, as well as parliament. Lawmakers from both PiS and opposition parties criticized the president s proposals, but since then Duda and PiS leader Jaroslaw Kaczynski have met to discuss the reform, struggling to reach a compromise.  After the latest meeting, which ended on Friday, representatives of both sides said compromise was nearing.  Law and Justice has made huge concessions when it comes to the judiciary reform. (...) I think that we are close to an agreement,  a PiS spokeswoman told broadcasters.  She added that PiS agreed on Duda s proposal that parliament will need a three-fifths majority to appoint new top judges as well as to reduce the influence of the justice minister on courts. Duda s top aide Krzysztof Szczerski was quoted as saying by the state-run news agency PAP that the meeting with Kaczynski was  a step towards achieving a shared, compromise version of the judiciary reforms within the boundaries of the bills recently submitted to parliament by the president .

       " 'NIAMEY (Reuters) - French and Nigerien troops were conducting operations on Thursday in a region of Niger where three U.S. Army Special Forces members were killed the day before, becoming the first American soldiers to die in West Africa in decades. Three Nigerien soldiers were also killed and two U.S. soldiers wounded in the attack, which took place in a southwestern Niger region where insurgents are active, U.S. Africa Command spokeswoman Robyn Mack said. France s regional Barkhane force was asked to support a counterattack after the Niger and U.S. troops were ambushed, French army spokesman Colonel Patrick Steiger told a news conference in Paris.   It s not clear if the attackers knew the Americans were present,  said a Western security source.  Initial information suggests there was a trap that appeared designed to get them out of their vehicles and then they opened fire.  Insurgents in the area include militants from al Qaeda in Islamic Maghreb and a local branch of Islamic State, Mack said. The Western security source said al Qaeda and a relatively new group called Islamic State in the Greater Sahara were the main suspects, although no one had yet claimed responsibility.  Two other Niger security sources said four military helicopters had been sent to the region and that reinforcements arrived on Thursday morning in the Tillaberi area, where the attack took place. The Pentagon declined to discuss details, citing ongoing operations, but said the U.S. forces were part of a growing mission to bolster Niger s armed forces  ability to battle militants.   We extend our deepest condolences and sympathies to the families of the fallen, and those injured in this attack,  Pentagon spokeswoman Dana White told a news briefing. Nigerien army Colonel Abou Tagu  said the joint Nigerian-American patrol on the Mali-Niger border was ambushed by militants riding  in a dozen vehicles and about 20 motorcycles near the village of Tongo Tongo.  He cited intense fighting, saying the joint Nigerian-American force  showed courage.  He said four Nigerien soldiers were killed and eight were wounded. A statement by U.S. Africa Command on Thursday said one unspecified  partner nation member  had died but did not name the nation. In a speech on Thursday, Niger President Mahamadou Issoufou condemned the attack.  Our country has just been the victim of a terrorist attack that claimed a large number of victims,  he said. Islamist militants form part of a regional insurgency in the poor, sparsely populated deserts of West Africa s Sahel. Jihadists have stepped up attacks on U.N. peacekeepers, Malian soldiers and civilian targets since being driven back in northern Mali by a French-led military intervention in 2013.  Malian militant groups have expanded their reach into neighboring countries, including Niger, where a series of attacks by armed groups led the government in March to declare a state of emergency in the southwest. The European Union has pledged tens of millions of euros to a new regional force of five Sahelian countries - Niger, Mali, Chad, Burkina Faso and Mauritania - in a bid to contain Islamist militant groups. The United States also views the region as a growing priority. Rinaldo Depagne, West Africa project director at International Crisis Group, said the borderlands between Mali, Niger and Burkina Faso were  becoming a new permanent hotbed of violence , threatened by increasingly organized militant groups.  This shows the level of organization of these groups and also their confidence,  Depagne said.  Andrew Lebovich, a visiting fellow at the European Council on Foreign Relations, said Wednesday s attack revealed how U.S. training of Nigerien forces  has accelerated and also verged into ongoing military operations .

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump said he was unsure whether his top diplomat, Rex Tillerson, would remain in his post for the rest of Trump’s term in the White House and was “not happy” that some State Department staff were not supporting his agenda.     In an interview with Laura Ingraham on Fox News late Thursday, Trump attacked the department under Secretary of State Tillerson and said he alone determines U.S. foreign policy.     “The one that matters is me,” Trump said.\\xa0“I’m the only one that matters because, when it comes to it, that’s what the policy is going to be.” Asked if he planned to keep Tillerson on board for the rest of his term, Trump told Fox, “Well, we’ll see.\\xa0I don’t know.”    Trump left on Friday on a trip to Asia with Tillerson following months of conflict between the two. Trump’s comments drew criticism in Congress, where many   fellow Republicans have joined Democrats in objecting to Trump’s plan to slash spending on diplomacy and foreign aid, and his failure to fill key foreign policy jobs. “One would hope that if he’s the only one that matters that he at least gets some feedback from top staff who perhaps can know a little bit more about some of these things than he does,” Representative Eliot Engel, top Democrat on the House of Representatives Foreign Affairs Committee, told Reuters. Tensions between Trump, a real estate developer and reality television star in office since January, and Tillerson,  former chief executive at Exxon Mobil Corp (XOM.N), resurfaced last month amid reports Tillerson had called Trump a “moron” and considered resigning. Tillerson later said he never considered leaving. Trump  said they had a good relationship but criticized Tillerson as weak. Tillerson’s State Department has also been at odds with the White House over global issues including rising tensions over North Korea’s nuclear program. Richard Haass, president of the Council of Foreign Relations, said Trump’s comments spelled trouble not just for the current secretary but for overall foreign policy.  “It’s not just about Rex Tillerson, it’s about who comes after Rex Tillerson. If the president is not determined to make sure his secretary of state will succeed, the secretary of state can’t succeed,” Haass told CBS News. Tillerson has made overhauling the department a top priority and tightened control by consolidating his authority. Critics have decried the reorganization and unfilled jobs at a time when international crises continue around the world. At a recent meeting of former national security advisers, former Secretary of State Colin Powell told H.R. McMaster, Trump’s national security advisor, that the administration was gutting State. McMaster replied that there were people who did not support the president’s agenda, two people present told Reuters. On Thursday, Trump said many of the posts were not needed and he is “not happy” with others already there.  “I want my vision, but my vision is my vision,” he said. “Rex is in there working hard ... he’s doing the best he can.” (This version of the story has been refiled to add dropped words in 11th paragraph) ',\n",
       " 'BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - The bodies of five Argentine men killed in a truck attack in New York City last week arrived at their hometown of Rosario on Monday.  A police escort accompanied the bodies of the men as they were transported from Buenos Aires Ezeiza International Airport in a motorcade to Rosario, Argentina s third-largest city. Other officers on horseback saluted as the cars carrying the victims passed through the streets of Buenos Aires early in the morning. The motorcade reached a funeral home in Rosario several hours later.  The victims are Hern n Ferruchi, Diego Enrique Angelini, Hern n Diego Mendoza and Ariel Erlij, all 48, and Alejandro Dami n Pagnucco, 49.  The five, who were businessmen or architects, were among eight people killed on Tuesday in the truck attack as they rode bicycles on a pedestrian path in Lower Manhattan along the Hudson River. The Argentines were part of a group of 10 friends who had traveled to New York to celebrate the 30th anniversary of their high school graduation.  Uzbek immigrant Sayfullo Saipov, 29, was charged in a federal court on Wednesday with driving the truck down the bike trail, crushing pedestrians and cyclists, in support of Islamic State. Argentine President Mauricio Macri and first lady Juliana Awada joined New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio at the site of the attack on Monday, where they laid flowers and paid tribute to the victims.  Terrorism does not distinguish or limit countries, nor nationalities,  Macri said.  Argentines confirm that we want to be part of this battle, that we all have to give in this world to coexist in peace and with love.   Macri is in New York for a previously planned trip to meet with investors and business executives.  De Blasio said the five Argentines  visit to New York was an affirmation about all that is good about life.   We live 5,000 miles apart, but we feel a tremendous sense of unity and a deep connection right now,  De Blasio said. Rosario mourned for three days after the deadly attack. The victims  high school, where administrators said lifelong friendships are common among students, is counseling students and observing a weeklong mourning period.   Friendship moves the world,  said 65-year-old Rosario resident Adriana Sorzoli,  and I am very sad.   ',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government on Wednesday proposed an increase of 0.25 percent on average in payments to health insurers who offer Medicare Advantage insurance, which provides health benefits to more than 18 million elderly or disabled people. Enrollment in these plans grew by about 7 percent last year to account for about one-third of Medicare members, making it an important growth business for private insurers who are facing changes in their business as Republicans seek to repeal and replace Obamacare. It is not clear if Republicans will make any broad changes to the Medicare Advantage program, or to Medicare. Ipsita Smolinski, managing director at Capitol Street in Washington D.C. said on Wednesday that Medicare Advantage could get a boost amid the Republican push for private programs.  The payment rate increase of 25 basis points was in line with estimates that analysts had released ahead of time and shares of insurers including UnitedHealth Group Inc and Humana Inc, two of the largest providers of these plans, were little changed in after-hours trading. JPMorgan’s Gary Taylor said in a research note last week that he had been expecting a proposal for payments that were flat to slightly up from the rate that the government is now paying insurers who provide plans. Last year, the government proposed an increase of about 1.35 percent but later trimmed that back about 50 basis points. But insurers have 30 days to respond to the proposed payment rates and other changes included in the regulatory notice, which this year was 159 pages long, and may ask for a bigger increase.  “The 2018 update is only a smidge better than flat which I suspect may anger some plans,” Smolinski said. She said she expected that the payment rate could rise between now and when final rates are set. Insurers use the payment rate information provided by the government to prepare bids to sell Medicare Advantage plans in specific areas.  The Centers for Medicare & Medicaid Services, the division of the U.S. Department of Health & Human Services that regulates Medicare, will announce the final rate on April 3.  It said that it expected an additional 2.5 percent increase in payments related to coding of medical services.  The payment rate takes into account annual growth in medical costs and statutory requirements to reduce government payments to insurers for Medicare Advantage closer to the level it pays in traditional fee-for-service Medicare. Marilyn Tavenner, the CEO of America’s Health Insurance Plans, the industry’s biggest lobbying group, said that it is reviewing the notice to be sure “the program is protected from harmful cuts.” ',\n",

       " 'Donald Trump claims to have a huge penis, but he apparently doesn t have the balls to handle tough questions about his racism.When NPR s Cokie Roberts interviewed Trump on Wednesday morning, she challenged his racism and how it is affecting children. Mr. Trump, there have been incidents of children, of white children, pointing to their darker-skinned classmates and saying,  you ll be deported when Donald Trump is president.  There have been incidents of white kids at basketball games holding up signs to teams that have Hispanics on them saying,  we re going to build a wall to keep you out.  Are you proud of that? Is that something that you ve done into the American and social discourse that you re proud of? The thin-skinned Trump had an immediate problem with the question, calling it  nasty  and claiming that he has never heard of such instances before now. Well I think your question s a very nasty question and I m not proud of it because I didn t even hear of it,  Trump replied.  And I certainly do not like it at all when I hear about it. Trump then proceeded to talk over Roberts as she attempted to press him on the fact that his campaign has been nastier than any question she has asked, pointing at his hostility towards Hispanics, Muslims, and even black people at his rallies.Roberts didn t back down though. As Trump bragged about the  beautiful door  his Mexican border wall will have, she asked him again to think of the children and give his response to the way kids are picking up his racism and using it against fellow students and schools: But what about the children, Mr. Trump? What about what the children are hearing from you and how they are responding to it? Trump responded by claiming that he thinks  people are responding very positively,  and repeated his slogan that he trying to  Make America Great Again,  to which Roberts quipped,  unless you think American is great already.

       " 'A letter to the editor appeared in The New York Times yesterday about how devastating Trump s immigration policy is. It s not only going to destroy immigrant families and further harm our deteriorating relationship with Mexico; it s also going to rip apart military families. The families that keep our soldiers grounded when they re overseas in combat zones. And Trump doesn t care.David Kubat, a member of the Minnesota National Guard and also an immigration lawyer, wrote the short letter, where he said: I have personally experienced the hardship of deployments to combat zones, and know the incredible importance of family stability during that trying time. This week, this administration rescinded the Parole in Place program, harming thousands of military families across the country. This is another example of the careless excess of the administration s immigration policy. Parole in Place protects military spouses, parents and children from deportation and was put in place by President Obama. It gives servicemembers peace of mind that their families will still be here when they get home. Now they don t have that because to Trump, it seems that soldiers should have to suffer if they were dumb enough to be involved with someone who could be subject to deportation.The GOP is supposed to be the family values party, and they love claiming that they re the only party that cares about the military. It s not bad enough that they say that and then turn around and cut funding for the VA and other helpful programs. Now their standard-bearer, their leader, is actively working to destroy the very thing that keeps our military grounded.Kubat went on to say: It is unconscionable to reverse a policy that strengthens our military and our veterans. That the program was not even named in the memo demonstrates either a lack of awareness, or worse, a casual disregard of the effect that this will have on those most vulnerable members of our military. Nice job, Republicans, for allowing this shitshow to make it all the way to the White House. When we start seeing a spike in severe mental problems in our fighting men and women, we ll know exactly where to point the finger.Kubat s full letter is below:Now #Trump can deport spouses & families of US military personnel.

He and his family, including his parents and three-year-old son, also live on the premises.According to the Spokesman-Review, Moudgil was working the desk at the motel when Kilgore first approached him. He made several racist comments during the encounter, and asked him if he  knew about Guantanamo Bay. Later Kilgore attempted to break down the door that separates Moudgil s apartment from the motel office, but was unsuccessful. He then tried to enter through a second door, located on the first floor. Moudgil locked all the doors and windows to the apartment. Kilgore managed to get inside through a sliding glass door, which he reached by going to the roof of the motel.Once inside the apartment, Kilgore began threatening the family at knife-point. He said  I m going to cut you up because you are a terrorist,  Moudgil told the Spokesman-Review.  All he saw was brown skin. Kilgore shoved Moudgil s elderly father, turning the knife on him. He told the family,  I was trained to kill people like you. Moudgil s father eventually managed to escape the apartment.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s leading choice to run the Federal Trade Commission is a Washington lawyer who served at the agency as a top official under President George W. Bush, a person briefed on the matter said on Wednesday. Joseph Simons, a partner at the law firm Paul, Weiss, Rifkind, Wharton and Garrison LLP, is the leading choice to run the FTC over Acting FTC chairman Maureen Ohlhausen, who has been running the agency since January. Bloomberg News reported the leading choice of Simons earlier on Wednesday. The timing of a formal presidential nomination is not clear. Simons was head of the FTC’s Bureau of Competition from June 2001 to August 2003 and has been involved in a number of major antitrust cases and acquisitions in private practice. Ohlhausen previously headed the FTC’s Office of Policy Planning. A veteran of the law firm Wilkinson Barker Knauer, LLP, Ohlhausen is expected to remain on the FTC as a commissioner, the source said. The FTC, which has five commission seats, now has only Ohlhausen and Commissioner Terrell McSweeny, a Democrat. Two of the empty seats may go to Republicans, but the remaining seat must go either to a Democrat or an independent. A leading candidate for another Republican slot is Noah Phillips, an aide to Senator John Cornyn, according to the person briefed on the matter. White House spokeswoman Lindsay Walters said Wednesday the administration has “no announcement at this time.” Simons did not immediately return requests for comment. An FTC spokeswoman had no comment. The FTC has two main missions. One is to fight scams and deceptive advertising and the other to review mergers to ensure they comply with antitrust law. The FTC is currently reviewing Amazon.com Inc’s (AMZN.O) proposed $13.7 billion acquisition of Whole Foods Market Inc WFM.O. The FTC sued Qualcomm Inc (QCOM.O) in January over allegations of anticompetitive behavior to maintain a monopoly on the chips that let cell phones connect to mobile data networks. The FTC has sued to stop mergers deemed illegal, such as Staples’ attempt to buy rival Office Depot. It is in the process of deciding if Walgreens Boots Alliance Inc (WBA.O) will be allowed to merge with Rite Aid Corp (RAD.N) to create the largest U.S. drugstore chain. In June, fantasy sports companies FanDuel and DraftKings scrapped a plan to merge following an FTC legal challenge. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Hillary Clinton has distanced herself from President Barack Obama on a number of high-profile issues since starting her bid for the White House. Now, under pressure from left-leaning challenger Bernie Sanders, she is embracing him and his legacy with fervor. That strategy could pose problems for Clinton in the long run as Republicans look for fodder to portray her as representing Obama’s third term should she win the Democratic nomination. As she faces an unexpected challenge from Sanders in the early voting states, Clinton’s move to portray herself as an heir to Obama’s policies is aimed at courting young voters and progressives who are part of the president’s political base.  But she could be setting herself up for difficulties with a general electorate weary of the status quo. Over and over again during a tense Democratic presidential debate on Sunday, Clinton, who served as Obama’s secretary of state for four years, played up her ties to the president and accused Sanders of undermining him. Gone were her mentions of differences with the president over Syria, trade, and immigration. Instead, Clinton praised the Affordable Care Act, Obama’s signature healthcare law. She highlighted her connection to the administration’s Iran nuclear deal and lauded the White House for sending staff to Silicon Valley to discuss cybersecurity. Clinton, who ran against Obama for the 2008 Democratic nomination and then joined his administration, said she could accept Sanders’ criticism of her campaign donations - one of the Vermont senator’s favorite critiques - but wouldn’t tolerate similar criticism targeted at her former boss. “The comments that Senator Sanders has made ... don’t just affect me, I can take that, but he’s criticized President Obama for taking donations from Wall Street. And President Obama has led our country out of the Great Recession,” she said. “I’m going to defend President Obama for taking on Wall Street, taking on the financial industry, and getting results.” Clinton played up her service as his top diplomat, emphasized her hours advising him in the Situation Room, and accused Sanders of wanting to throw out Obamacare, all while debating in South Carolina, a state in which Obama is well liked. Republicans welcomed the opening Clinton provided for them to cast her White House run as a bid for a third Obama term. “When you have a president who is so unpopular as President Barack Obama ... and his chief diplomat is embracing those policies and running as his third term, it’s going to be next to impossible,” said Ric Grenell, a former U.S. spokesman at the United Nations under Republican President George W. Bush.  Dissatisfaction with Obama and the agenda in Washington have helped propel two candidates outside the Republican establishment - businessman Donald Trump and Senator Ted Cruz of Texas - to the top of the party’s crowded presidential field. Trump appeared to reference Clinton’s comments about the president’s policies in a speech at Liberty University on Monday, saying the country cannot afford another four years of the same thing. “We can’t have another four years of Barack Obama,” he said. “We can’t have another four years of Hillary Clinton.” Perhaps foreshadowing future ads, the Republican National Committee noted that Democrats at Sunday’s debate had backed the current occupant of the White House. “Not content with Barack Obama’s legacy of a toxic Iran deal and the rise of ISIS in the Middle East, Democrats doubled down on the extreme and failed policies of the current administration,” the RNC said in a statement. Democrats said Clinton was embracing Obama because he is popular with the party’s base, including in Iowa, which holds the first nominating contest, called a caucus, on Feb. 1. “It just makes sense to highlight where you agree with a president who is popular among caucus goers, and Secretary Clinton found ways to get that done,” said Brent Colburn, a former Obama administration official who served as communications director for his 2012 campaign. Democratic strategist Richard Socarides, a Clinton supporter, said Republicans were bound to portray her potential presidency as a third Obama term anyway.  “She deserves a lot of credit for putting the country first and going to work for him,” Socarides said. “After Iowa and New Hampshire especially, that will matter to a lot of Democratic primary voters. And she is right to point out that Bernie has not always been there. She has.”      (Additional reporting by Alana Wise and Sarah N.

       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - China s ruling Communist Party broke with recent precedent on Wednesday, unveiling a new leadership line-up without a clear successor to President Xi Jinping, who has become arguably the most powerful Chinese leader since Mao Zedong. Xi led his team in order of rank on to a stage at Beijing s Great Hall of the People, overlooking Tiananmen Square, culminating a week-long party conclave at which he laid out his  vision for an increasingly prosperous China confident of its place on the world stage.  Apart from Xi, Premier Li Keqiang was the only one to retain his spot amid sweeping changes on the Politburo Standing Committee. There has been persistent speculation Xi could seek to stay on in some capacity beyond the end of his customary second five years in power, which began on Wednesday. All seven Standing Committee members are men in their 60s and, for the first time, none was born before China s 1949 Communist revolution. The make-up of the committee, which has ultimate control over the world s second-largest economy, appeared to be a compromise to include a blend of Xi allies and those considered loyal to party elders, including Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao, former presidents whose networks still wield influence. Cheng Li, an expert on Chinese politics at the Brookings Institution, said Xi appeared to have traded securing favorable amendments to the constitution in exchange for a compromise on the make-up of the Standing Committee, a line-up he likened to a  team of rivals . The member considered closest to Xi is Li Zhanshu, who has often accompanied Xi on overseas trips in a chief-of-staff-style role as the head the party s General Office.  Li, who is not related to the premier, was named the third-ranked member, meaning he will most likely assume the role of head of the largely rubber-stamp parliament. That will not be confirmed until parliament meets in March. Xi had already strengthened his hand considerably ahead of the announcement, with his political theory and  Belt and Road  infrastructure-led development strategy put into the party constitution. He was named the party s  core  last year. Guangdong party secretary Hu Chunhua and Chongqing party boss Chen Miner had been previously seen as prominent contenders to succeed Xi among the party s so-called sixth generation of leaders but were not included in the Standing Committee. Instead, both were named to the wider 25-member Politburo, a rung below the Standing Committee.  He s consolidated his power without making unnecessary problems for himself,  said David Zweig, a professor at Hong Kong University of Science and Technology.   The costs of keeping Wang Qishan or getting Chen Miner were too high. He didn t need to do it.  Wang, who led Xi s sweeping anti-graft campaign and was considered China s second most-powerful politician, is above retirement age; Chen was comparatively junior.  While the Standing Committee bears the hallmarks of compromise, the new Politburo is stacked with more than a dozen Xi allies, including Chen, Beijing party boss Cai Qi, economic adviser Liu He and Ding Xuexiang, who is expected to become Xi s chief of staff as director of the party s General Office.  Xi has managed to put a lot of his own people there, as much as possible,  said Bo Zhiyue, a New Zealand-based expert on Chinese politics.  Most of Xi s close associates are too junior to be put into the Politburo Standing Committee right away.  Blanket state media coverage made no mention of factional politics or alliances, while an editorial on the official People s Daily s WeChat account hailed the new seven-man line-up as a  dream team  to lead China into its  new era . Xi, who has sought to revitalize the Communist Party s role across Chinese society, made no mention of who his successor might be as he introduced his new Standing Committee at a media event broadcast live around the country. His remarks were translated consecutively into English. Xi did not take questions, but said the party had weathered trials and tribulations.  We will also work with other nations to build a global community with a shared future, and make new and greater contributions to the noble cause of peace and development for all humanity,  he said.  Xi and Li were first promoted to the Standing Committee at the 17th Party Congress in 2007, in a clear signal that the pair would succeed Hu Jintao and Wen Jiabao and occupy the top two  offices - which they did five years later.  Zhao Leji, who headed the party s Organisation Department, which oversees personnel decisions, replaced Wang Qishan as chief of the Central Commission for Discipline Inspection. ',\n",
       " 'HARARE (Reuters) - New President Emmerson Mnangagwa on Thursday called for the removal of Western sanctions on members of Zimbabwe s ruling elite and said elections due in 2018 were  nearer than you expect .  The United States maintains a travel and economic embargo on several ZANU-PF party officials, top military figures and some government-owned firms. It imposed it during former president Robert Mugabe s rule over what it called violations of human rights and democracy. The EU lifted most of its sanctions in 2014 but kept them on Mugabe and his wife Grace.   We call for the unconditional lifting of the political and economic sanctions, which have crippled our national development,  Mnangagwa told a meeting of the ZANU-PF central committee in downtown Harare.   We realize that isolation is not splendid or viable as there is more to gain through solidarity, mutually beneficial partnerships.  Mnangagwa, 75, became leader of the southern African nation last month after the military and ruling ZANU-PF turned against Mugabe, who had ruled the country for 37 years and was thought to be grooming his wife to succeed him. In the latter half of Mugabe s rule, the economy collapsed, especially after violent and chaotic seizures of thousands of white-owned commercial farms. The issuance of billions of dollars of domestic debt to pay for a bloated civil service triggered a collapse in the value of Zimbabwe s de facto currency and hyperinflation. The International Monetary Fund has promised to send a staff mission to Zimbabwe soon to meet with officials of the new government and assess the country s fiscal and economic situation. The international community will also be closely watching the next elections in 2018. The vote is due at the end of July in 2018 but there is talk it could be brought forward to as early as March.  Government will do all in its powers to ensure that the elections are credible, free and fair. These elections are nearer than what you expect,  Mnangagwa said without elaborating. The ruling and opposition parties have said they will ask electoral authorities to extend next week s voter registration deadline into February after the de facto military coup last month disrupted the registration process. Mnangagwa will be confirmed as party leader and its candidate for the presidential elections at a special one-day congress on Friday with Mugabe absent.  The 93-year-old former leader reportedly visited a hospital in Singapore for medical checks this week.  In comments suggesting he intends to draw a line under years of endemic corruption and impunity, Mnangagwa said he would name and shame those who failed to return stolen public funds after a three-month amnesty ending in February next year. He is under pressure to deliver, especially on the economy, which is in the grip of severe foreign currency shortages.  I have given three months for those who have taken money out of this country to bring it back,  the president said.   I didn t say that without knowledge. I have a list of who took money out, so in March when the period expires, those who have not heeded my moratorium, I will name them and shame them,  he said to loud applause. Separately, Former Zimbabwe finance minister Ignatius Chombo faced new corruption charges on Thursday. ',\n",

According to his blog, Allen aimed to be back in Britain by mid-November.  Don t try to rescue me, please - where I m going in PNG you won t ever find me you know,  he wrote on Twitter on Oct. 11. But after he missed a flight home last weekend, friends and family raised the alarm.  Benedict Allen is not out of danger yet. He is currently marooned in a remote part of Papua New Guinea that is only reachable by air after all the road bridges were cut due to tribal fighting,  Gardner, who is also the BBC s security correspondent, told Reuters.   Urgent efforts are now under way to try to airlift him out as soon as possible in case fighting erupts around him.  Gardner had earlier told the BBC that a PNG tribal commission had been looking for Allen and that he had been sighted by an airstrip. Reuters was unable to independently confirm the sighting.   Allen, who calls himself an  adventurer  on his website, describes being  beaten daily for six weeks  on a previous trip to PNG as part of an initiation ritual.  He also describes trekking a remote section of the Amazon,  during which, dying of starvation and malaria , he was forced to eat his dog. ',\n",

Kim to US District Judge Richard Berman.Rahimi let other inmates view the items on his laptop and gave them electronic copies, Kim s letter said. Discs of the materials were found in two inmates  possession.Defense attorneys for Rahimi have yet to respond to the allegations.Prosecutors said Rahimi began distributing these materials in October if not earlier. Rahimi was convicted October 16 on eight federal charges in connection with the Chelsea bombing.Among the inmates Rahimi gave the materials to, prosecutors say, is Sajmir Alimehmeti, who is scheduled to go on trial next month on terrorism-related charges.Rahimi was arrested and charged after a pressure cooker bomb went off in New York s Chelsea neighborhood on September 17, 2016. A second pressure cooker bomb was found a few blocks away, on 27th Street, but didn t detonate.Earlier the same day, a bomb went off near the start of a Marine Corps charity run in Seaside Park, New Jersey.After a two-week trial and roughly four hours of jury deliberation, Rahimi was convicted of charges including the use and attempted use of a weapon of mass destruction, bombing a public place, destroying property by means of fire or explosives, and using a destructive device in furtherance of a crime of violence.During the trial, the prosecution presented evidence   including DNA and fingerprints   linking Rahimi to the bombs that were placed in New Jersey and New York.Rahimi faces a mandatory sentence of life in prison, according to an earlier statement from Kim.Rahimi faces separate charges in other jurisdictions in connection with the bomb that went off in Seaside Park, a backpack containing improvised explosive devices found the following day at a transit station in Elizabeth, New Jersey, and a shootout he had with police before being taken into custody.',\n",

       " 'LISBON (Reuters) - The number of foreign tourists visiting Portugal jumped around 13 percent in January-July, putting the country firmly on track for another record year for tourism, which has been a key driver of its economic recovery since a 2011-14 debt crisis. The National Statistics Institute said on Thursday in its monthly data on the hotel sector that over 7.1 million foreign visitors stayed in Portuguese hotels through July, which helped drive total hotel revenues over 17 percent higher to 1.8 billion euros ($2.14 billion). Portugal s arrivals growth outpaced those in neighboring Spain, which chalked up a 11 percent rise in the same period, according to official Spanish data. Despite a deceleration in July from June levels, both the tourist arrivals and revenues so far this year maintained the pace of growth seen in 2016, when tourist arrivals exceeded 10 million for the first time.  August is traditionally the strongest month by far for holiday-making in Portugal, which lures foreign visitors with its beaches, historic sites and some of the lowest prices for wining and dining in western Europe. Pop star Madonna has this month become the most illustrious of a growing number of foreign residents in Portugal, which was also named Europe s top destination for expatriates in a survey by social network InterNations.   Hotel revenues and all travel-related revenues account for about 10 percent of Portugal s gross domestic product. The tourism sector is also a key source of employment. Tourism has been growing since 2011, helping the heavily indebted country overcome its economic and debt crisis. Economic growth this year is expected to accelerate to over 2 percent from 1.4 percent in 2016. Portugal has opened dozens of new hotels in the past year and private entrepreneurs have redeveloped hundreds of apartment buildings in old parts of Lisbon and other areas to rent to tourists, helping the country s flagging construction sector.

       " '(Reuters) - The U.S. Supreme Court on Thursday ruled that Puerto Rico cannot pursue charges against people for the same crime that federal authorities have already prosecuted them, dealing a blow to the U.S. territory’s claim that while it is not a state it should be treated like one. The court ruled 6-2 in favor of defendants Luis Sanchez Valle and Jaime Gomez Vazquez, who were charged with illegally selling guns in 2008 by Puerto Rican authorities as well as federal prosecutors. The two pleaded guilty to the federal charges and then argued that Puerto Rico’s indictments should be dismissed because of the double jeopardy clause of the U.S. Constitution that bars people from being prosecuted twice for the same offense. A trial judge dismissed the Puerto Rico charges, but they were reinstated by an appeals court. In a March 2015 ruling, the Puerto Rico Supreme Court ruled against prosecutors, prompting the territory to appeal to the high court. On its surface, the case was about criminal law. But it also raised questions about the extent to which the Caribbean island, which has been a U.S. territory since 1898, has sovereign powers akin to any of the 50 U.S. states. The double jeopardy clause allows U.S. states and the federal government to prosecute people separately for the same actions because they are separate sovereign entities. The Supreme Court, in a ruling authored by Justice Elena Kagan, said that the original source of power for Puerto Rico’s Constitution came from the U.S. Congress, via a 1950 law. “Put simply, Congress conferred the authority to create the Puerto Rico Constitution, which in turn confers the authority to bring criminal charges,” Kagan wrote. Liberal justices Sonia Sotomayor, whose parents were from Puerto Rico, and Stephen Breyer dissented. Some experts saw the federal government’s argument against treating Puerto Rico as a separate governmental entity as having implications for another issue: how to deal with the territory’s debt crisis. In such a scenario, that argument could help establish a legal precedent that Puerto Rico is not a sovereign entity, possibly to justify imposing a federal control board or some other mechanism to address Puerto Rico’s roughly $70 billion in debt.\\xa0The U.S. Congress is currently considering legislation on the issue. The Supreme Court is expected to rule by the end of the month in another case involving Puerto Rico’s bid to revive a law that would allow it to cut billions of dollars in debt at public utilities in a key test in its quest to weather its crisis.

Tens of thousands of Central Americans came into the United States through the Mexican border and contagious diseases many considered to be eradicated in the U.S. became a tremendous concern. The CDC, which operates under the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS), responded by opening an emergency facility designed to monitor and coordinate response activities to eminent public health threats. This special emergency division was created after the 2001 terrorist attacks and has responded to more than 50 public health threats, including hurricanes, food borne disease outbreaks, the 2009 H1N1 influenza pandemic and the Haiti cholera outbreak. Scientists from across the CDC are brought together to analyze, validate, and efficiently exchange information during a public health emergency and connect with response partners. The EOC also coordinates the deployment of CDC staff and the procurement and management of all equipment and supplies that agency responders may need during their deployment.[ ]It s a major and costly operation that can stick American taxpayers with a huge tab. That s why JW launched a probe when the Obama administration took in the illegal immigrants, initially coined Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC), with open arms last summer. JW has sued the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) for planning records involving the border crisis as well as information relating to the solicitation of  on-demand escort services  for the 65,000 UACs that remain in the U.S. Last year JW also reported that the illegal immigrant minors have brought in serious diseases, including swine flu, dengue fever, possibly Ebola virus and tuberculosis.The CDC records obtained by JW this week include email exchanges between agency officials directly involved in the activation of the EOC to handle the health threats created by the influx of illegal alien minors last summer. In an email dated June 9, 2014, CDC Logistics Management Specialist George Roark wrote to CDC Public Health Advisor William Adams that  no country in the world would allow  the influx. Adams replies that  in ten years or less, they ll all be voting Commander s intent  Roark fires back by describing Obama as  the worst pres we have ever had he truly is  the amateur  but a Marxist too.

       " 'This is outrageous and someone needs to put this right-wing nut job in her place.Rather than applaud Khizr Khan for standing up to hate and bigotry as he celebrated the Constitution and America, right-wing radio host Sandy Rios did something even worse than Ann Coulter in response. You know what this convention really needed? An angry Muslim with a thick accent like Fareed Zacaria,  Coulter wrote on Twitter. Of course, even conservatives slammed Coulter for her shameful words.But Rios, who works for the American Family Association hate organization, went further than Coulter by questioning Khan s loyalty to America and even had the gall to question the loyalty of his son, who died for this country to save the American soldiers under his command in Iraq. If you are so concerned, Mr. Khan, if you re an American first, then distinguish yourself and condemn Islamists, condemn the Muslim Brotherhood, then we will listen to you, and stop waving the Constitution,  Rios said before claiming that Muslims cannot truly practice Islam and live under the Constitution and accusing Khan of lying. As far as I can tell, Islam, truly, supporters of Islam and the Quran, cannot embrace the Constitution. Now, if you have a different view, then explain that to us and then maybe we can be persuaded, but don t shame America for having genuine and rightful concerns about Muslims in our midst when we have no idea who they are or what they really believe, and we re not even sure about you, sir, because we know about taqiyya, which is the practice of lying to the infidel in order to advance the Muslim cause. First of all, this man lost his son in Iraq so it s safe to say he condemns terrorists. What Rios is employing is the Trump and Republican claim that simply saying the words  radical Islam  will magically make ISIS disappear and they are claiming that anyone who doesn t say it isn t a real patriot.Donald Trump made that same claim when he questioned President Obama s loyalty to America back in June in the wake of the Orlando mass shooting. Look, we re led by a man that either is not tough, not smart, or he s got something else in mind,  Trump told Fox News.  There s something going on. It s inconceivable. There s something going on. He doesn t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands   it s one or the other and either one is unacceptable. But Rios didn t stop there. She also questioned the loyalty of Khan s son Humayun, who proudly wore the uniform and flag of this country and posthumously received the Purple Heart and Bronze Star for his heroic actions on the day he was killed. So I m sorry, we ll not be shamed. I m sorry for the loss of their son and I hope he is a loyal American. But I think a loyal American Muslim would be more like Zuhdi Jasser, who is very clear about where he stands, who was very patriotic and loyal and totally distances himself from Islamism, so if that s the case for this gentleman, then he should ve said that on the platform rather than shaming us for having concerns about Muslim immigration. Here s the audio via Right Wing Watch.I would say that this is a new low for conservatives but they have already hit rock bottom. The fact is that members of ISIS WANT us to refer to them as followers of Islam because they want legitimacy. But they are not real followers of Islam. They have simply co-opted the religion in an effort to justify their violent cause and they do not represent the over one billion peaceful Muslims in the world. Basically, Rios expects every Muslim to take a loyalty oath, which is exactly what Donald Trump wants to do to any Muslim seeking refuge within our shores.This is pure hate and bigotry and it has no place in our society. If anyone is violating the Constitution it is the likes of Rios and Trump who think that only Christianity is protected by it. But the Constitution protects freedom of religion. That means all religions, even Islam.And Rios should be removed from the airwaves for even suggesting that Khan and his son are not loyal to this country. He and his son have sacrificed more for this country than she ever has or ever will.Featured Image: Screenshot',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Incoming Federal Reserve chair Jerome Powell, chosen by U.S. President Donald Trump to keep the recovery humming, appears set to let an expected trillion=dollar tax cut run its course through the economy as weak wage growth and inflation buttress his view that the economy remains underpowered. Powell in statements throughout the year, culminating with his recent Senate confirmation hearing, has been clear he sees little risk of inflation that would prompt the Fed to raise rates faster than expected, and takes weak wage growth as a sign that sidelined workers remain to be drawn into jobs. New data added evidence to that view on Friday. Employment in November grew faster than expected, but wage growth remained muted. The share of working age adults with jobs continued a steady, six-year recovery that is approaching its pre-crisis peak. Even with the unemployment rate at a 17-year low of 4.1 percent, “there’s no sense of an overheating economy or a particularly tight labor market,” Powell told members of the Senate Banking Committee, saying that the Fed should raise rates only gradually.  Debate among Powell’s colleagues, meanwhile, has highlighted other risks if the Fed speeds its pace of rate increases. Some policymakers feel the central bank has already undercut its credibility by raising interest rates while inflation remains so weak. Others have noted that if the Fed continues raising short-term rates while long-term rates remain stalled, it could turn the shape of the bond yield curve upside down, a typical signal of recession.  “If the Fed gets its paradigm wrong and sees inflation that ultimately doesn’t materialize, and they take rates too far, then markets would feel aggrieved,” said Carl Tannenbaum, chief economist at Northern Trust in Chicago, and a former senior risk official at the Fed Board. Other analysts are starting to see a potential dovish surprise when Powell takes over in February, the tax cuts could kick in, and the Fed stands aside.   With a background as an investment banker rather than as an economist rooted in a particular analytical framework, Powell will lead “a more data-driven Fed, which at the current juncture means a more dovish Fed,” until and if inflation recovers, said Robin Brooks, chief economist at the Institute of International Finance.  He expects the Fed under Powell to only raise rates twice next year.   Policymakers will give an initial reading on the impact of the Republican tax plan when they meet next week. They are expected to raise interest rates for the third time this year. They will also update their economic and interest rate projections for 2018 and beyond, the first such forecasts since the outlines of the tax overhaul became clear. Top Republicans from the House and the Senate are rushing to complete negotiations to push the tax plan into law.   Though Janet Yellen remains Fed chair until February, her final scheduled press conference on Wednesday afternoon will set the policy backdrop Powell inherits. The 64-year-old lawyer will attend the meeting as a sitting governor, and help shape the statement issued that day by the Federal Open Market Committee. It is a group struggling with a fundamental issue. The economy is arguably as much as a half a percentage point below full employment, a condition in which prices and wages should be rising. Yet both remain weak. Into that mix, the tax cut legislation would put tens of billions of dollars back in the hands of corporations and households.  If there is still “slack” in the economy, that could produce faster real growth as spending and investment increase, and more workers are hired. However, if the economy is near or above its potential, as some measures indicate, it may merely cause faster-than-desired price increases, or a jump in stock and other asset values that raise concerns of a bubble.  As the tax plan advanced in Congress, forecasting shops at Goldman Sachs, JP Morgan and others penciled in a faster pace of Fed rate increases - essentially expecting the Fed would need to lean against the inflationary outcome. The tax package is “ultimately worth almost two additional Fed hikes” in coming years, Goldman Sachs economists David Mericle and Alec Phillips wrote in a recent analysis. But the new chair’s own public speeches and comments throughout the past year have shown an evolving faith that the Fed’s go-slow approach can continue, giving more time for workers to rebound from the 2007-2009 crisis without creating other economic risks. “Accommodative policy did not generate high inflation or excessive credit growth; rather, it helped restore full employment,” Powell said in June in his last extensive speech on monetary policy before he emerged as a contender for the top Fed job.  His outlook is consistent with positions Trump and current chair Janet Yellen have taken, and the depth of his commitment to that view will be a critical part of the Fed’s debate about whether and how to react to the tax plan. At his confirmation hearing, Powell avoided any direct critique or endorsement of the pending legislation, telling lawmakers fiscal policy was their domain. But when asked about Fed staff research that challenged a key Republican premise that corporate tax cuts generate jobs, Powell kept his distance. “It’s just someone’s research,” Powell told senators. “Don’t associate that with a position of the board.” ',\n",

       " 'NEW YORK/SAN FRANCISCO (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s travel restrictions on people from seven countries could dampen international enrollment at U.S. colleges, at a time they have become increasingly reliant on tuition revenue from overseas students. Colleges and universities have struggled in recent years with slowing tuition growth, increased competition and a stronger focus on making education more affordable. (Graphic: here) Those factors have increased the importance of international students, who made up 5.2 percent of enrollment last year, up from 3.2 percent a decade earlier, according to the Institute of International Education, or IIE.  “International student growth is important for many institutions,” said Roy Eappen, municipal research analyst at Wells Fargo. “Many international students come to the U.S. to study and are willing to pay full price for higher education.” Analysts said international student applications could be hit by the White House travel order. Trump suspended travelers from seven majority-Muslim countries - Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen - saying the move would help protect Americans from terrorist attacks. The curbs come “at a delicate point in the admissions cycle” because students are beginning to decide where to enroll this autumn, said Susan Fitzgerald, associate managing director, Moody’s. “You could see an impact in the fall. We just don’t know yet.” U.S. universities in both Democratic- and Republican-led states said over the weekend they were unnerved by the executive order.  Lee Bollinger, president of New York’s Columbia University, wrote in a statement on Sunday that “if this order stands, there is the certainty of a profound impact on our University community.” Of the 1,043,839 international students in the United States during the 2015-16 school year, 17,354, or 1.7 percent, came from the countries affected by the order, IIE data shows. While that is a small portion of the total, there could be a broader impact on the country’s ability to attract students from the global marketplace if the United States becomes viewed as  potentially less welcoming for international students, some analysts said. Wells Fargo’s Eappen said any kind of anti-immigration sentiment may lead to a pullback in demand from international students.  IIE President Allan Goodman said in an emailed statement that “beyond the immediate impact of students from specific countries who are not able to enter the country, there could be a ripple effect of significant unintended economic consequences as students, faculty and researchers from other countries decide whether to come to the United States.” Public universities have increasingly fallen victim to state budget cuts or tuition freezes, while many private universities now discount tuition, meaning they slash their price tags to lure prospective students. In many parts of the country, enrollment numbers are on the decline and university debt is on the rise. That makes attracting international students increasingly important. International students make up an estimated 10 to 12 percent of tuition revenue among U.S. schools rated by Moody’s, Fitzgerald said.  “University education for Americans is subsidized by foreigners who occupy seats in classrooms,” said David Kotok, chairman and chief investment officer of Cumberland Advisors. “Ask any dean or provost what his school’s financial structure would look like if there were no foreign students enrolled.” According to NAFSA, an international education association, international students contributed $32.8 billion and supported more than 400,000 jobs in the U.S. economy during the 2015-2016 academic year.  Moody’s Fitzgerald said international students had become a counterweight to the relatively low revenue growth from domestic students among U.S. schools. “It would be an additional challenge for the sector should it fall,” Fitzgerald said.

Senate confirmation is required for all the posts except national security adviser, White House chief of staff, directors of the White House National Economic Council and the White House National Trade Council,\\xa0and White House strategist. The following is a list of Republican Trump’s selections for top jobs in his administration: Tillerson, 64, has spent his entire career at Exxon Mobil Corp, where he rose to serve as its chairman and CEO in 2006. A civil engineer by training, the Texan joined the world’s largest energy company in 1975 and led several of its operations in the United States as well as in Yemen, Thailand and Russia. As Exxon’s chief executive, he maintained close ties with Moscow and opposed U.S. sanctions against Russia for its incursion into Crimea. Mnuchin, 54, is a successful private equity investor, hedge fund manager and Hollywood financier who spent 17 years at Goldman Sachs before leaving in 2002. He assembled an investor group to buy a failed California mortgage lender in 2009, rebranded it as OneWest Bank and built it into Southern California’s largest bank. Housing advocacy groups criticized the bank for its foreclosure practices, accusing it of being too quick to foreclose on struggling homeowners. Mattis is a retired Marine general known for his tough talk, distrust of Iran and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan. A former leader of Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, Mattis, 66, is known by many U.S. forces by his nickname “Mad Dog.” He was in 2005 rebuked for saying: “It’s fun to shoot some people.” Sessions, 69, was the first U.S. senator to endorse Trump’s presidential bid and has been a close ally since. Son of a country store owner, the Alabama senator and former federal prosecutor has long taken a tough stance on illegal immigration, opposing any path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants.  Zinke, 55, a first-term Republican representative and a member of the House subcommittee on natural resources, has voted for legislation that would weaken environmental safeguards on public lands. He has taken stances favoring coal, which suffered during the Obama administration. The League of Conservation Voters, which ranks lawmakers on their environmental record, gave Zinke an extremely low lifetime score of 3 percent. Ross, 79, heads the private equity firm W.L. Ross & Co and Forbes has pegged his net worth at about $2.9 billion. A staunch supporter of Trump, Ross helped shape the Trump campaign’s views on trade policy. He blames the North American Free Trade Agreement with Canada and Mexico, which went into force in 1994, and the 2001 entry of China into the World Trade Organization, for causing massive U.S. factory job losses.               Puzder, chief executive officer of CKE Restaurants Inc, which runs the Carl’s Jr. and Hardee’s fast-food chains, has been a vociferous critic of government regulation of the workplace and the National Labor Relations Board. Puzder, 66, has argued that higher minimum wages would hurt workers by forcing restaurants to close and praises the benefits of automation, so his appointment is likely to antagonize organized labor.  U.S. Representative Price, 62, is an orthopedic surgeon who heads the House Budget Committee. A representative from Georgia since 2005, Price has criticized Obamacare and has championed a plan of tax credits, expanded health savings accounts and lawsuit reforms to replace it. He is opposed to abortion. Carson, 65, is a retired neurosurgeon who dropped out of the Republican presidential nominating race in March and threw his support to Trump. A popular writer and speaker in conservative circles, Carson previously indicated reluctance to take a position in the incoming administration because of his lack of experience in the federal government. Carson is the first African-American picked for a Cabinet spot by Trump. Chao, 63, was labor secretary under President George W. Bush for eight years and the first Asian-American woman to hold a Cabinet position. She is a director at Ingersoll Rand, News Corp and Vulcan Materials Co. She is married to U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, a Republican from Kentucky. Perry, 66, adds to the list of oil drilling advocates skeptical about climate change who have been picked for senior positions in Trump’s Cabinet. The selections have worried environmentalists but cheered an oil and gas industry eager for expansion. Perry, who also briefly ran in the 2016 presidential race, would be responsible for U.S. energy policy and oversee the nation’s nuclear weapons program.  DeVos, 58, is a billionaire Republican donor, a former chair of the Michigan Republican Party and an advocate for the privatization of education. As chair of the American Federation for Children, she has pushed at the state level for vouchers that families can use to send their children to private schools and for expansion of charter schools. The final leadership role of Kelly’s 45-year military career was head of the U.S. Southern Command, responsible for U.S. military activities and relationships in Latin America and the Caribbean. The 66-year-old retired Marine general differed with Obama on key issues and has warned of vulnerabilities along the United States’ southern border with Mexico. Recently re-elected to serve as Republican National Committee chairman, Priebus will give up his party post to join Trump in the White House, where the low-key Washington operative could help forge ties with Congress to advance Trump’s agenda. Priebus, 44, was a steadfast supporter of Trump during the presidential campaign even as the party fractured amid the choice. ENVIRONMENTAL PROTECTION AGENCY ADMINISTRATOR: SCOTT PRUITT An ardent opponent of President Barack Obama’s measures to stem climate change, Oklahoma Attorney General Pruitt, 48, has enraged environmental activists. But he fits with the president-elect’s promise to cut the agency back and eliminate regulation that he says is stifling oil and gas drilling. Pruitt became the top state prosecutor for Oklahoma, which has extensive oil reserves, in 2011 and has challenged the EPA multiple times since. U.S. Representative Mick Mulvaney, 49, a South Carolina Republican, is a fiscal conservative. He was an outspoken critic of former House of Representatives Speaker John Boehner, who resigned in 2015 amid opposition from fellow Republicans who were members of the House Freedom Caucus. Mulvaney was first elected to Congress in 2010. Haley, 44, has been the Republican governor of South Carolina since 2011 and has little experience in foreign policy or the federal government. The daughter of Indian immigrants, she led a successful push last year to remove the Confederate battle flag from the grounds of the South Carolina state capitol after the killing of nine black churchgoers in Charleston by a white gunman. McMahon, 68, is a co-founder and former chief executive of the professional wrestling franchise WWE, which is based in Stamford, Connecticut. She ran unsuccessfully as a Republican for a U.S. Senate seat in Connecticut in 2010 and 2012 and was an early supporter of Trump’s presidential campaign. U.S. Representative Pompeo, 52, is a third-term congressman from Kansas who serves on the House of Representatives Intelligence Committee, which oversees the CIA, National Security Agency and cyber security. A retired Army officer and Harvard Law School graduate, Pompeo supports the U.S. government’s sweeping collection of Americans’ communications data and wants to scrap the nuclear deal with Iran. Retired Lieutenant General Flynn, 57, was an early Trump supporter and serves as vice chairman on his transition team. He began his Army career in 1981 and was deployed in Afghanistan and Iraq. Flynn became head of the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2012 under President Barack Obama but retired a year earlier than expected, according to media reports, and became a fierce critic of Obama’s foreign policy. Cohn, 56, president and chief operating officer of investment bank Goldman Sachs, had widely been considered heir apparent to Lloyd Blankfein, CEO of the Wall Street firm. Trump hammered Goldman and Blankfein during the presidential campaign, releasing a television ad that called Blankfein part of a “global power structure” that had robbed America’s working class. Navarro, 67, has suggested a stepped-up engagement with Taiwan, including assistance with a submarine development program. A professor at University of California, Irvine, who advised Trump during the campaign, Navarro argued that Washington should stop referring to the “one China” policy, but stopped short of suggesting it should recognize Taipei: “There is no need to unnecessarily poke the Panda.” Viola, 60, is a West Point graduate and U.S. Army veteran who served in the 101st Airborne Division. He founded high-frequency trading firm Virtu Financial Inc and served as  chairman of the New York Mercantile Exchange, where he began his financial services career. After the Sept. 11, 2001, al Qaeda attacks on New York and Washington, Viola helped found the Combating Terrorism Center at the U.S. Military Academy at West Point. He is an owner of the Florida Panthers ice hockey team. CHIEF WHITE HOUSE STRATEGIST, SENIOR COUNSELOR: STEVE BANNON The former head of the conservative website Breitbart News came aboard as Trump’s campaign chairman in August. A rabble-rousing conservative media figure, he helped shift Breitbart into a forum for the alt-right, a loose confederation of those who reject mainstream politics and includes neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. His hiring signals Trump’s dedication to operating outside the norms of Washington. As White House chief of staff, Bannon, 63, will serve as Trump’s gatekeeper and agenda-setter. ',\n",

       " 'The entitled refugee mentality is becoming the norm in bleeding heart nations around the world. We recently reported about complaints from Italian citizens that refugees were dumping garbage in the streets of Italy to protest poor wi-fi. In Germany, an Afghan family refused to get off the bus at their new government funded flat, after complaining they were promised a home.Immigrant Services Association of Nova Scotia says staff thoroughly inspected an apartment to ensure it was bedbug-free before moving in a family of six Syrian refugees on Feb. 1.Director of operations Gerry Mills said families are moved into safe and appropriate housing, and ISANS staff keep the health and well-being of refugees in mind. Our staff know what bedbugs look like and since Friday we ve had staff there every day in different apartments, honestly trying to look for bedbugs. We have found not one bedbug,  she said.On Tuesday, Ziad Zeina told CBC News through an interpreter that he wanted to get his family out of their two-bedroom apartment on Gerrish Street because the bedbug problem  is non-stop and it s not going to change and there s no solution at this moment. But Mills said one of the first steps workers take is to inquire with building managers whether the biting pests are a problem on site.In the case of Harbour View Apartments where the Zeinas live, Mills said building managers took the preventive step of fumigating their unit even though it did not have bedbugs. You can actually tell because there s still kind of an actual vague smell in them [apartments],  Mills said.Or was it a pre-existing skin condition?Wafaa Al Safadi holds her 10-month-old son, Rayan Zeina. She says he is covered in bed bug bites.

The marks were on the child even before they moved into that apartment. When they were in the hotel, we spoke with the family then about taking the child to the doctor to get some medication. ISANS said there are 16 families of Syrian refugees living in the same building and no other families have complained about the blood-sucking insects. Via: CBC ',\n",

       " 'ZURICH (Reuters) - Switzerland will return to Nigeria around $321 million in assets seized from the family of former military ruler Sani Abacha via a deal signed with the World Bank on Monday, the Swiss government said. Transparency International, a corruption watchdog, has accused Abacha of stealing up to $5 billion of public money during the five years he ran the oil-rich country, from 1993 until his death in 1998. In 2014, Nigeria and the Abacha family reached an agreement for the West African country to get back the funds, which had been frozen, in return for dropping a complaint against the former military ruler s son, Abba Abacha. The son was charged by a Swiss court with money-laundering, fraud and forgery in April 2005, after being extradited from Germany, and later spent 561 days in custody.  In 2006, Luxembourg ordered that funds held by the younger Abacha be frozen. Now Switzerland, Nigeria and the World Bank have agreed the funds will be repatriated via a project supported and overseen by the World Bank, the Swiss government said.  The project will strengthen social security for the poorest sections of the Nigerian population. The agreement also regulates the disbursement of restituted funds in tranches and sets out concrete measures to be taken in the event of misuse or corruption,  it added. ',\n",
       " 'Mitch McConnell is still making ridiculous excuses to justify what Senate Republicans did to Supreme Court nominee Merrick Garland.When Antonin Scalia passed away in February 2016, his body was not even cold before Republicans declared that they would refuse to hold hearings to confirm any replacement chosen by President Obama.And so, when President Obama selected a centrist judge named Merrick Garland to be the next Supreme Court Justice, Republicans immediately refused to do their job as outlined by the Constitution.Republicans tried to excuse their behavior by claiming that Democrats would have done the same thing even though Democrats have never once refused to grant a nominee a confirmation hearing. Furthermore, Republicans claimed that no Supreme Court nominee has ever been approved by the Senate in an election year.McConnell made the same claim on Sunday after Chuck Todd grilled him in response to Republican insistence that Donald Trump s Supreme Court nominee Neil Gorsuch be confirmed immediately. The tradition had been not to confirm vacancies in the middle of a presidential [election] year,  McConnell said.  You d have to go back 80 years to find the last time it happened. Everyone knew, including President Obama s former White House counsel, that if the shoe had been on the other foot, [Democrats] wouldn t have filled a Republican president s vacancy in the middle of a presidential election. Again, Democrats have never refused to hold a confirmation hearing for a Supreme Court nominee.Also, Mitch McConnell is ignorant of Senate history.As it turns out, there have been several election year confirmations of Supreme Court nominees and we don t have to go back 80 years to find one.In fact, the last one occurred only 29 years ago when the Senate confirmed Justice Anthony Kennedy in 1988 during Ronald Reagan s last year in office.It also happened in 1956 when Dwight Eisenhower nominated William Brennan. The Senate confirmed him despite it being an election year.In 1940, also an election year, Franklin Roosevelt nominated Frank Murphy to the Supreme Court and the Senate confirmed him.So contrary to what Mitch McConnell says, there is plenty of precedent in our history proving that the Senate has no such  tradition  of not confirming Supreme Court nominees during an election year.Todd challenged McConnell for not simply holding a confirmation hearing and giving Garland an up or down vote. Why not put him up for a vote?  Todd asked.  Any senator can have a rationale to not vote for a confirmation. Why not put Merrick Garland on the floor and if the rationale is,  You know what? Too close to an election,  then vote no? Look, we litigated that last year,  a flustered McConnell replied.  The American people decided that they wanted Donald Trump to make the nomination, not Hillary Clinton. Actually, the American people voted for Hillary Clinton. She won the popular vote by nearly 3 million votes.McConnell then claimed that there s  no rational reason  to not vote to confirm Gorsuch. But that s not true either. You see, by refusing to grant Garland a confirmation hearing, Republicans set a precedent and gave Democrats all the reasons they need to block Gorsuch at all costs.Plus, Gorsuch has a terrible record and he was nominated by Trump, which is all the more reason for Democrats to block him.If Senate Republicans had not acted like petulant children in response to Merrick Garland, perhaps Democrats would have been more open. But the way Republicans treated Garland was un-American and totally outrageous. They disgraced the Senate with their conduct and Democrats now have precedent to respond in kind.But McConnell balked when Todd challenged him to take up a resolution that says Supreme Court vacancies won t be filled during an election year. In short, McConnell knows that if a Republican had been president in 2016, Senate Republicans would have rushed any Supreme Court nomination through. Because in the end, Republicans are hypocrites.Here s the video via YouTube.There is no excuse for Democrats to not block Neil Gorsuch from becoming a Supreme Curt Justice. In fact, if Republicans somehow get him confirmed, Democrats should impeach him as soon as they take back control of the Senate. This Supreme Court seat rightfully belongs to Merrick Garland. He deserves a fair confirmation hearing before Republicans are ever able to nominate someone to the Supreme Court again. Until then, Republican nominees should be the same and worse than the way Republicans treated Merrick Garland.And Republicans only have themselves to blame.Featured Image: Screenshot',\n",
       " 'Last week, printers at colleges across the country suddenly started spitting out fliers advocating white supremacy and Antisemitism. The headline of the flier was  White man are you sick and tired of the Jews destroying your country through mass immigration and degeneracy?  And it went downhill from there.On Monday, a white supremacist hacker claimed responsibility for the mass hack:PRINCETON, N.J.   A well-known computer hacker who goes by the name of  Weev  said he was behind a wave of anti-Semitic, racist fliers that appeared on printers at more than a dozen college campuses last week. Weev is the alias of Andrew Auernheimer, who in 2010 was part of a group of hackers that discovered a security loophole on AT&T s servers and gained access to the data of 114,000 customers. Mr. Auernheimer was initially convicted of identity fraud and conspiracy to access a computer without authorization, but his conviction was overturned on appeal.It s not clear that  Weev  even broke any laws since all of the printers he accessed were open to remote printing and were not protected by a password.Although  Weev  did not mention Donald Trump, it s not much of a stretch to assume he s a big fan. While the white supremacy movement has always been lurking in the shadows, Trump s candidacy has emboldened it to crawl out into the light. With millions of people no longer ashamed to be openly racist, the ranks of the KKK and Neo-Nazi groups have swelled, giving them and people like  Weev  the confidence to publicly tout their hatred of Those People:The fliers directed readers to The Daily Stormer, a neo-Nazi website. Mr. Auernheimer said free speech concerns were behind his printing spree.  My motivation is this: White cultures and only white cultures are subject to an invasion of foreigners. The  threat  to  white culture  that he s referring to is the loss of white privilege. This is truly a terrifying concept to people who think white people are inherently superior but refuse to compete on a level playing field. It s also the fear that minorities, once in power and no longer minorities, will treat white people the way white people have treated them for centuries.We should expect to see more (a lot more) racist propaganda being disseminated by bigots who honestly think their time has come again.Featured image via nbcphiladelphia.com',\n",
       " 'Big news out of the Treasury Department: After much debate, Alexander Hamilton will remain on the $10 bill   and instead, it s Andrew Jackson who is being given the boot.According to Politico, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew is set to announce two major changes to the twenty, neither of which will make America s white supremacists very happy. First, former President Andrew Jackson will be replaced by a black woman, Harriet Tubman. Tubman was a legendary fighter against slavery and is recognized as having personally shepherded hundreds of escaped slaves to freedom in the north during her lifetime. The second change is the Treasury will be changing the $5 bill to  depict civil rights era leaders. Both changes reflect the recent cultural movement to acknowledge and honor the legacy of racial justice in America. It can also be seen as a bit of condemnation for the actions of President Jackson, a man whom historians are quick to point out gave America some of its most shameful actions against Native American peoples   including the forced migration and resettlement of many tribes that would eventually become known as the Trail of Tears.Until recently, it was Alexander Hamilton who was on the chopping block. However, thanks to a resurgence of interest in the founding father s life and legacy and the outrage over Jackson, Treasury Secretary Jack Lew was adamant that Hamilton would stay, even if someone else went. So long, President Jackson!Harriet Tubman being printed on the $20 bill will be a turning point in America s cultural identity. She represents the country at its best   humane, strong and fighting for what s right. She will also be the first woman and first person of color to be represented on paper currency (Native American, Sacajawea is already on a less commonly used dollar coin.)This all has to be quite a shock to the toxic white supremacists in the country who believe that white people are being erased and replaced by  minorities.  The fact that they will have to stare at symbols of racial equality each time they use a $20 or $5 bill is deeply satisfying. Or as my colleague Oliver Willis recently put it:dear wingnuts who are going to freak out about harriet tubman on the $20. give your bills to me.

       " 'MADRID (Reuters) - European Commission President Jean-Claude Juncker on Thursday called on Europe to stand up against separatism at a time when the Catalan independence push has deeply divided Spain. The standoff between Madrid and supporters of Catalan independence, triggered by a banned Oct. 1 referendum splitting with Spain, has stirred separatist feelings far beyond Spanish borders.  Nationalisms are a poison that prevent Europe from working together , said Juncker in a speech at a university Spanish city of Salamanca, where he received an award.  We cannot stay with our arms crossed because it is time for us to do what needs to be done. I say  no  to any form of separatism that weakens Europe and further widens the existing fissures.  Juncker s comments will further disappoint deposed Catalan president, Carles Puigdemont, who went into self-imposed exile in Belgium last week after Spain s central government responded to an independence declaration by firing his administration. Puigdemont had ambitions to garner support for his independence campaign in the heart of the European Union and has appealed for EU intervention, which so far has not been forthcoming. The secessionist drive has dragged Spain into its worst political crisis since the return of democracy four decades ago. The Catalan parliament s speaker and five lawmakers are appearing on Thursday before Spain s Supreme Court in Madrid to answer charges of rebellion and sedition for their roles in staging the referendum. The European Union is also currently facing a huge challenge to its unity in Britain s impending exit from the bloc. The Spanish dispute also bears some similarities with the battle for Scottish separation, which culminated in a 2014 referendum that narrowly rejected independence. Spanish Prime Minister Mariano Rajoy, who was with Juncker in Salamanca, thanked him for his support  in such difficult times.   Juncker has supported the Spanish government s actions, has expressed his respect for our constitution, our laws and our legal system,  he told students and professors at the event. ',\n",
       " 'In the wake of the worst mass shooting in American history committed by an ISIS sympathizer, Donald Trump appeared on Fox News to accuse President Obama of helping the terrorists.After hearing that 50 people were massacred at an LGBT night club in Orlando on Saturday night, Trump s callous first reaction was to give himself a pat on the back for being  right  about terrorism. You know, because not just any idiot can predict that an attack of some kind will happen in the future.But on Monday morning during an interview on Fox & Friends, Trump crossed the line by actually suggesting that President Obama is not doing anything to fight terrorism and may be aiding the terrorists. He doesn t get it or he gets it better than anybody understands. It s one or the other,  Trump said.  And either one is unacceptable. We re led by a man who is a very   look, we re led by a man that either is, is not tough, not smart, or he s got something else in mind. And the something else in mind, you know, people can t believe it. People cannot   they cannot believe that President Obama is acting the ways he acts and can t even mention the words radical Islamic terrorism. There s something going on. It s inconceivable. Here s the video via YouTube.President Obama doesn t need to say words to defeat ISIS. Despite what Trump says, Obama has been fighting ISIS for a long time now even as Republicans in Congress refuse to declare war on the terrorist organization they paved the way for in the first place by invading Iraq back during the Bush Administration. Claiming that President Obama is in league with the terrorists is just absurd and outrageous.Airstrikes killed a top ISIS leader in March, which was only the second such strike to take out a member of ISIS that month. A strike also took out an ISIS commander in Iraq in January and yet another strike killed an ISIS leader in Libya last November.And that s only four of the many such airstrikes that have dealt major blows to ISIS and their operations.But according to Trump, President Obama only has to say three words and ISIS will somehow magically disappear off the face of the planet, thus demonstrating once again that Trump is completely unqualified to be president. Because while he is congratulating himself for a prediction that any three-year-old could make and running his mouth about what President Obama should say to defeat ISIS, our commander-in-chief has been taking action. If Trump really wants to blame someone for not being hard on ISIS he should blame the Republicans in Congress for not exercising their power to declare war. The president can only do so much without Congress and Republicans are sitting on their hands instead of doing their jobs.Featured image via Christopher Furlong/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'GOMA, Democratic Republic of Congo (Reuters) - Eighteen people, including a provincial lawmaker, went on trial in eastern Congo on Thursday for the rapes of dozens of children, victims  rights activists said. At least 46 children, some as young as 18 months, were raped near the village of Kavumu between 2013 and 2016, sparking an international outcry and criticism of Democratic Republic of Congo s government for its slow response. In June last year, authorities arrested Frederic Batumike, a deputy from South Kivu province, and members of a militia he is alleged to have led. Rights groups hope the trial, which is expected to last several weeks, will strike a blow against impunity in Congo, where they say government forces and militia groups in the lawless eastern borderland have long used rape as a weapon of war. The trial opened in a military court in Kavumu on Thursday with the defendants facing charges of rape, murder and organization of an armed group, Jean Chrysostome Kijana, an activist representing the victims, told Reuters.  Proceedings began 10 hours late and lasted just 20 minutes, during which the defendants  names were read aloud.   The start of the trial is a strong signal in the fight against impunity,  said Kijana. However, he added that the delay to proceedings did raise fears that the trial could end up just being  yet another in a long list of botched trials . Millions died in eastern Congo in regional wars between 1996 and 2003, most from hunger and disease. Dozens of armed groups continue to prey on local populations and exploit the area s rich natural resources. Experts say Congo has made some progress in combating sexual violence and several high-level militia and army commanders have been successfully prosecuted in recent years, but the problem remains pervasive. According to the government, Batumike s militia employed a spiritual adviser who told its fighters that raping very young children would confer supernatural protection. Advocacy groups involved in the case say it has been particularly difficult to investigate because the victims are so young and their families were often asleep when the alleged rapes occurred.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions abruptly asked the remaining 46 chief federal prosecutors left over from the Obama administration to resign on Friday, including Manhattan U.S. Attorney Preet Bharara, who had been asked to stay on in November by then President-elect Donald Trump. Although U.S. attorneys are political appointees, and the request from Trump’s Justice Department is part of a routine process, the move came as a surprise. Not every new administration replaces all U.S. attorneys at once.  A Justice Department spokeswoman confirmed the resignation requests included Bharara, whose office handles some of the most critical business and criminal cases passing through the federal judicial system. Bharara met with Trump in Trump Tower on Nov. 30. After, Bharara told reporters the two had a “good meeting” and he had agreed to stay on. On Friday, Bharara was unsure where he stood because he did not know if the person who contacted him about resigning was aware that Trump had asked him to remain in office, according to a source familiar with the matter.  It was not immediately clear if all resignations would ultimately be accepted. A Justice Department spokesman said on Friday Trump had called Dana Boente, acting U.S. deputy attorney general, to decline his resignation.  Trump also called Maryland U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, his pick to take over as deputy attorney general, to keep him in his post, the spokesman said.     Bharara, appointed by Democratic President Barack Obama in 2009, has pursued an aggressive push against corruption in state and city politics and is known for his prosecution of white-collar criminal cases. He also has been overseeing a federal probe into New York City Mayor Bill de Blasio’s fundraising. In November, he announced charges against two defendants in connection with what he called a multimillion-dollar fraud and kickback scheme at Valeant Pharmaceuticals International Inc (VRX.TO). He has also brought dozens of successful cases against insider traders, including a $1.8 billion settlement and plea deal in 2013 with hedge fund SAC Capital Advisors LP. His office has secured settlements with companies including General Motors Co (GM.N) and JPMorgan Chase & Co (JPM.N); won several convictions and guilty pleas of former employees of Ponzi scheme operator Bernard Madoff; and prosecuted Suleiman Abu Ghaith, a son-in-law of the late al Qaeda leader Osama bin Laden. Bharara’s priorities have often matched those set by Obama’s Justice Department, which potentially puts him at odds with the Trump administration. Amid an increase in civil rights investigations nationally, for example, Bharara’s office joined a lawsuit that led to a settlement in 2015 aimed at reducing violence in New York City’s Rikers Island jail complex. U.S. Senator Chuck Schumer, a Democrat, said in a statement that he was “troubled” to learn of the requests for resignations, “particularly that of Preet Bharara.” As Schumer’s chief counsel, Bharara helped lead the investigation of the dismissals of U.S. attorneys in 2006 during the George W. Bush administration. Robert Capers, U.S. Attorney in Brooklyn, issued a statement saying he had been asked to resign. He said Bridget Rohde, the chief assistant U.S. attorney in that office, would take over his role in an acting capacity. The Justice Department said on Friday: “Until the new U.S. attorneys are confirmed, the dedicated career prosecutors in our U.S. attorney’s offices will continue the great work of the department in investigating, prosecuting, and deterring the most violent offenders.” ',\n",
       " 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - A senior Russian lawmaker said on Tuesday the resignation of U.S. President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, suggested Trump had been backed into a corner or that his administration had been “infected” by anti-Russian feeling. Flynn resigned late on Monday after revelations he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. “Either Trump has not gained the requisite independence and he is consequently being not unsuccessfully backed into a corner, or Russophobia has already infected the new administration also from top to bottom,” MP Konstantin Kosachev was cited as saying by the RIA Novosti news agency. Kosachev is head of the upper house of parliament’s international affairs committee. ',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - President Trump’s administration has drafted a plan to pause a program that allows family members join refugees already settled in the United States until they can undergo increased security checks, two sources with knowledge of the situation told Reuters. The measure is one of several being considered for refugees, the sources said.  The administration also may expand the use of intensive security checks by multiple federal agencies, called “security advisory opinions” (SAO) to apply to women from countries designated as high-risk by the U.S. government. Currently there are usually only mandatory SAOs, as they are called, for men from those countries, the sources said.  The administration is also considering expanding the categories of refugees required to be fingerprinted, the sources said. The proposals, if implemented, could significantly slow down refugee admissions and leave refugees who thought they were headed to the United States in perilous situations abroad, say refugee advocates and former officials.  David Lapan, a spokesman from the Department of Homeland Security said he could not comment on specific proposals that are still in the review process.   A State Department official also declined to comment while the review is underway and a White House spokeswoman said they have no announcements at this time.  Republican President Donald Trump came into office in January with a goal of sharply cutting refugee admissions and quickly issued temporary bans on refugees and travelers from several Muslim-majority countries that were challenged in court. A 120-day temporary ban on refugees, put in place to study current procedures, expires on Oct. 24.  The sources, who requested anonymity because they are not authorized to speak about the plans before they are announced, said the new measures could be announced at the end of the temporary ban. Trump has said “extreme vetting” of refugees and immigrants and visitors is needed to prevent terrorist attacks. The administration could pause the visa issuing process  for “following-to-join” spouses and children of refugees who have already made it to the United States, known as V93 cases, the sources said. In 2015, just 3 percent of the nearly 70,000 refugee arrivals were those types of beneficiaries, according to the Department of Homeland Security. “Reports on the type of vetting measures being considered for our refugee resettlement program are disturbing,” said Hans Van de Weerd, the Vice President of U.S. Programs at the International Rescue Committee.  They amount “to a desertion of victims of war and heinous persecution, who have done everything asked of them as they prepare to arrive to the US,” he said. Refugees currently undergo differing levels of security checks when applying for admission to the United States in a process that can take 18-24 months.  “When you put in additional security checks you can basically halt the system,” said Robert Carey, the former director of the Office of Refugee Resettlement under former President Barack Obama, a Democrat.  “Every check is only good for a finite period of time and they expire and the whole process has to start all over again,” he said, adding that the level of scrutiny is higher for refugees than most any other visa applicant to the United States. Trump also lowered the maximum number of refugees to be allowed into the United States in 2017 to 50,000 from the 110,000 originally set by Obama. The 2018 level has been set at 45,000, the lowest number in decades. ',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - In the weeks since Hillary Clinton’s shock election defeat to U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, a rumor has taken hold among New York City’s political chattering class: could she challenge Mayor Bill de Blasio’s reelection bid this year? Discussion of a possible Clinton campaign intensified last week when conservative news website Newsmax reported that Democrats unhappy with de Blasio were pressing her to run. Stories soon appeared in various outlets, including the New York Times and the New York Daily News. Still, the chances seem remote. Although the mayor of the largest U.S. city is often seen as a national figure, it could be seen as a step down for Clinton, 69, a former U.S. secretary of state who came tantalizingly close to winning the White House two months ago. “I’m a Brooklyn kid, and my comment is, fuhgeddaboudit,” said Douglas Muzzio, a political scientist at Baruch College in New York and an expert in city politics. “There is zero chance that’s going to happen.” Clinton has yet to say what she plans to do next, and representatives of Clinton’s presidential campaign did not immediately respond to a request for comment on Sunday. A Clinton confidante, Neera Tanden, said on CNN on Sunday that Clinton was focused on helping children and families in her next role. “I don’t expect her to ever run for any elective office again,” Tanden said when asked if Clinton would run for mayor. De Blasio, a fellow Democrat who won his first term in 2013, has had some rocky moments, including state and federal corruption investigations that have reportedly examined his fundraising tactics. A high-profile figure in the party’s liberal wing, De Blasio supported Clinton in the presidential primary after some public waffling. A spokesman for his reelection campaign declined to comment on a potential Clinton candidacy. In the presidential election, Clinton won more than 80 percent of the votes in heavily Democratic New York City, despite Trump’s status as a native son born in the borough of Queens. Clinton first moved to New York State in 1999 in order to run for the U.S. Senate, winning election the following year. She lives with her husband, former President Bill Clinton, in Chappaqua, New York, about 30 miles (48 km) north of the city. Under state law, Clinton could run for mayor as long as she became a city resident by the election, according to the Times. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump on Monday issued an executive order revoking limits imposed by predecessor Barack Obama on the transfer of surplus military equipment to local law enforcement agencies, the White House said. Obama had curtailed the equipment transfer program after law enforcement officers using military-style armored vehicles and guns confronted protesters in Ferguson, Missouri, in 2014 following the fatal police shooting of a black teenager. Trump’s executive order said, “All executive departments and agencies are directed, as of the date of this order and consistent with Federal law, to cease implementing those recommendations and, if necessary, to take prompt action to rescind any rules, regulations, guidelines, or policies implementing them.” The Republican president has reversed or cut back many of his Democratic predecessor’s policies since taking office in January. The use of military equipment in Ferguson prompted a wider outcry over the use of war-fighting equipment by local law enforcement agencies in the United States. After a review, Obama barred the military from transferring certain types of equipment to police or sheriff’s departments, including tracked armored vehicles, armed aircraft or vehicles of any kind, .50-caliber firearms and ammunition, grenade launchers, bayonets and camouflage uniforms. Obama also required law enforcement agencies to justify the need for items like helicopters and other aircraft, wheeled armored vehicles, unmanned drones, riot helmets and “flash-bang” grenades. “These restrictions that had been imposed went too far,” U.S. Attorney General Jeff Sessions told a meeting of the Fraternal Order of Police union in Nashville, Tennessee, earlier on Monday. “We will not put superficial concerns above public safety. We will do our best to get you what you need.” Sessions did not specify what those superficial concerns were. Sessions said helmets and body armor available through the Defense Department program were the types of equipment that saved the life of a police officer during the 2016 Orlando, Florida, nightclub shooting. And helicopters and armored vehicles are vital to emergency and disaster response, he said. Monday’s order drew criticism from some of Trump’s fellow Republicans in Congress. “It is one thing for federal officials to work with local authorities to reduce or solve crime, but it is another for them to subsidize militarization,” Senator Rand Paul said in a statement. Paul promised to introduce legislation that would ban transfers of certain military equipment to local law enforcement agencies, improve transparency surrounding such transfers, and require the agencies to return equipment prohibited under the proposed law. U.S. Representative Mark Sanford also condemned the executive order, criticizing the transfer program as a potential waste of taxpayers’ dollars. He said in a statement that he had introduced a bill in 2016 to auction off military equipment instead of give it to local agencies. The Defense Department’s law enforcement support program has transferred more than $6 billion worth of equipment to police agencies since its inception 25 years ago, Pentagon figures show. ',\n",

       " 'Likening girls to common crops that should be rushed off to the market as soon as possible is a growing belief among conservative  Christians. If you have heard of the Duggar family you ve likely heard of the Quiverfull movement they belong to, which requires Christians to have as many kids as possible, which is why the Duggars have 19 children.But there is another part of the Quiverfull movement that is even creepier.One Quiverfull ministry not only pushes couples to pop out kids like rabbits, they preach that fathers should farm the girls like crops such as apples and give them over to men as early as possible .In other words, this Christian fundamentalist movement believe in child marriage like the ones Americans often are horrified by when we hear stories of little girls being married off to middle-aged men in the Middle East.Their website is called  Let Them Marry,  and one of the first things you would see is a tree shaped missive comparing little girls to apples that must be picked early by the farmer/father and provided to men who are  in need. Girls are like apples on trees. Their fathers are the farmers, whose job is to care for them. He must protect his apples from pests and disease. He must guard them against thieves who may pick his apples prematurely. Neither those at the top nor those at the bottom can help their location. But, when each reaches peak ripeness, it is the farmer s job to harvest that fruit and give it to whom he will, to those in need. So there is nothing wrong with the apples still on the tree and nothing wrong with the boys who seek them. But it is the farmer s duty to provide for both, in due season. Here s the image via Raw Story.A quote from the group leader, Vaughn Ohlman, makes it clear that this pedophilia comes not from the legalization of same-sex marriage like conservatives constantly claim, but directly from religious fanaticism, which former Quiverfull member Vyckie Garrison describes as a  gross  ideology combined with the Christian purity movement in which  the value of a young woman is in her virginity   a consumable commodity owned by her future husband, kept in trust by Daddy. We believe that not only should most people marry, they should marry in their youth. The Bible speaks of the  wife of thy youth  (Prov. 5:18; Is. 54:6; Mal. 2:14-15) and  children of the youth  (Ps. 127:4). Scripture also speaks of not letting children pass the flower of their age (1 Cor. 7:36)   Leaving the physically mature young man struggling with fornication and leaving the physically mature young woman wallowing in fruitless, barren celibacy these are both unscriptural and ungodly actions.In short, this conservative Christian group is a haven for pedophiles who are trying to use religious liberty to justify their sickening desire to marry and rape little girls.Just another example of the Christian Sharia law conservatives are trying to force down our throats.

       " 'TAIPEI (Reuters) - President Tsai Ing-wen vowed on Tuesday to defend Taiwan s freedom and democracy amid growing pressure from giant neighbor China, using a National Day speech to warn that the self-ruled island would not bow to pressure. China considers proudly democratic Taiwan to be a wayward province and has never renounced the use of force to bring the island under its control. Relations with Beijing have deteriorated sharply since Tsai, who leads the pro-independence Democratic Progressive Party, took office last year, with China suspecting she wants to push for the island s formal independence, a red line for Beijing. China has cut off a regular dialogue mechanism with Taiwan, ramped up military drills around the island and stepped up international pressure to limit Taiwan s diplomatic footprint. Tsai, who has pledged to maintain peace with China, said her government was still seeking breakthroughs in ties with Beijing and promised consistent and stable policies.  We need to remember democracy and freedom were rights obtained through all of Taiwan people s countless efforts,  Tsai said.  Therefore, we need to use all our power to defend Taiwan s democratic and freedom values and lifestyle,  she said. Tsai s speech came a week before China holds its twice-a-decade Communist Party Congress, where President Xi Jinping, who has taken a robust approach to territorial disputes in the East and South China Seas, will cement his grip on power. Her government has continued to rattle Beijing, with her newly appointed premier, William Lai, telling parliament last month he was a  political worker who advocates Taiwan independence . However, Tsai has also sought to give Beijing a roadmap where its  goodwill  can be extended, which in turn could give her a chance to reciprocate and rein in the more independence-leaning hardliners on the island.  We have offered our greatest goodwill,  she said in her 20-minute address.  I have repeatedly said, our goodwill doesn t change, our promises don t change; we won t walk on the old path of confrontation, but we won t bow to pressure,  Tsai said. Responding to Tsai s speech, China s Taiwan Affairs Office said Taiwan had to clearly state that Taiwan and mainland China belonged to  one China .  Only if the one China principle is upheld and Taiwan independence opposed can there be peaceful and stable development of relations across the Taiwan Strait,  it said in a statement carried by the official Xinhua news agency. Tsai reiterated the importance of implementing the island s new  southbound  policy of forging closer ties with countries in the region, saying Taiwan was seeking to find a new position in the international community.  In the face of rapid change in the Asia-Pacific region, Taiwan is already prepared to play an even more important role in the region s prosperity and stability,  she said. ',\n",

       " 'BOSTON (Reuters) - Massachusetts Governor Charlie Baker on Friday signed a bill raising the tax on retail sales of recreational marijuana to 20 percent, up from the 12 percent rate proposed in a successful 2016 ballot initiative. The state is one of eight in the United States to have legalized use of the drug by adults 21 and older. Marijuana possession was legalized on Dec. 15, 2016, but retail sales of the drug remain illegal until Jan. 1, 2018, a delay intended to give state and local authorities time to decide how to regulate the trade. Baker, a Republican, opposed legalization as did several senior state officials, and he voiced concern about the future after signing the law. “I don’t support this. I worry terribly about what the consequences will be,” Baker told reporters. “We appreciate the careful consideration the legislature took to balance input from lawmakers, educators, public safety officials and public health professionals, while honoring the will of the voters regarding the adult use of marijuana.” The law also allows cities and towns to ban or limit marijuana sales and creates a five-member Cannabis Control Commission with responsibility for overseeing the sale of recreational and medical marijuana. The measure approved by voters called for legal retail sales of the drug to begin on July 1, but state legislators pushed that date back by six months to allow time to develop regulations. Legalization backers, who had protested the delay, called on state officials to move quickly in appointing the new control commission. “The state will benefit greatly from the tax revenues and jobs created by the new industry, and we are confident lawmakers will secure appropriate funding to get the regulatory system up and running on the current timeline,” said Jim Borghesani, a spokesman for Regulate Mass, which supported the ballot initiative.

       " 'Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireAny business expert will tell you that marketing is not an exact science. The same is true in politics, and even more so in this historic election season. As the polls closed yesterday, Republican candidate and US Senator Marco Rubio took to the podium to announce he was finally bowing out the GOP presidential primary race. Front runner Donald Trump nearly swept the board starting with Rubio s home state of Florida, followed by Illinois, North Carolina, Missouri and in US territory Mariana Islands, while Ohio governor John Kasich took the remaining contest winning his first primary race ,in his home state.With 99 delegates at stake in a winner take all contest, Florida was meant to be Rubio s gallant last stand. Even though the polls showed Rubio trailing in double digits before Tuesday, Rubio still insisted he was going to win, and even go on to win the nomination.Marco: A smile you can trust.. Quite frankly, I think a lot of people are going to be embarrassed tonight and are going to want refunds from the money they spent on those polls because we re going to win Florida,  said Rubio.  We feel very optimistic about that. When it was all said and done, Trump beat Rubio 46% to 27% in Florida. A blow out.By the end of his long drive, Rubio had only managed to win one state caucus in Minnesota, leaving him with no real primary victory. To his investors, the truth of the  matter might be almost too painful to comprehend  that beyond all the hype, their man was really a bottom tier candidate.Super Tuesday s humiliating loss was indicative of a Rubio rise  that never rose. Before Tuesday s defeat, no matter how poorly Florida Senator Marco Rubio showed in previous primary elections, and no matter how badly he was polling in his home state of Florida   the media, led by CNN and FOX News, still covered his campaign like he was winning the election. Clearly, there was a concerted and well-coordinated effort by the Republican establishment and major broadcast media outlets to promote Rubio s candidacy well above the actual candidate s weight division.Three weeks ago, in a last-ditch effort to elevate his poll numbers, Rubio tried to out-Trump Trump, by unleashing his own round of back-ally personal verbal insults at the front runner in the hope of pulling The Donald back down to earth. Rubio began publicly calling Trump a  con man  and asserted that Trump had not achieved anything in his business career and along with fellow competitor Ted Cruz, inferred that the billionaire property and entertainment mogul Trump had inherited $200 million dollars from his late father and therefore was not deserving of any accolades. When Trump would joke about Rubio s lack of height (Rubio is 5 8  and Trump is 6 2 ), Rubio hit back joking,  look how small Donald s hands are, and you what they say about men with small hands..  to his crowds roaring with laughter before the Texas primary three weeks earlier.Trump finally hit back with a moniker that Rubio could never shake, renaming him  Little Marco.  LITTLE MARCO: Trump s crude deconstruction of Rubio delivered the final blow.Although their cage match pulled more TV airtime and attention away from a Trump-obsessed media, in the end it backfired horribly for Marco, as America got an uncomfortable snapshot of a nasty and desperate Rubio   hardly the look of stability, moderation and  unity that Rubio marketeers were trying to project, and hardly presidential either.What was most telling about Rubio s response to a situation, partly of his own making, was that Rubio shirked any responsibility for ratcheting-up the rhetoric, and instead tried to blame Trump for the degrading  tone  of the election: This is a frightening, grotesque and disturbing development in American politics,  Rubio said of the violence.  We are being ripped apart at the seams now,  he continued.  I m sad for this country. This is supposed to be the example to the world of how a republic functions and instead people are watching third-world images last night coming out of Chicago. It was too late. The damage was already done. Some pundits were calling it  political suicide  by Rubio   a gross error of political miscalculation on his part. But this would be missing the point because in reality, beyond all the incredible marketing hype, Rubio s campaign never achieved any serious market penetration to begin with.It s important to remember that the establishment firmly believed, and still to this day, that Marco Rubio could be the Republican Party s answer to the marketing sensation that was Barack Obama in 2008. By capitalizing on his youth and his Latino profile, the GOP elite saw this as a  turn-key  marketing solution. Just like a soda pop brand, party and media operatives believed that by positioning Rubio s brand in a highbrow market tier, voters would make the necessary connections and move to act by casting their vote for him. DETATCHED: Darryl Issa throws himself under the bus,, desperate to inflate Rubio before Super Tuesday.On Super Tuesday, the transmission truly fell out of the Rubio marketing machine. After months of boasting about how he would win his home state, Rubio plugger and California Congressman Darryl Issa (R), insisted that,  Marco is leading in early (voting) returns in Florida. Seriously, Congressman Issa?Issa appeared to be carrying water for the GOP establishment by doing the last minute media rounds for kingmaker Mitt Romney, who weeks earlier dropped the gauntlet down on the Trump train during a speech at the University of Utah. Romney,  a former Republican presidential candidate and Massachusetts governor implored his GOP herd to join forces and stop Trump by splitting the votes by voting for Kasich in Ohio, and for Rubio in Florida. Romney hoped  that his divide and conquer strategy would rob Trump of the delegate majority needed to secure the GOP nomination before the Republican National Convention in Cleveland, Ohio this July. JET-SET: Rubio taking instructions from elite off-shoring corporate raider Mitt Romney.Clearly, Romney had staked his claim behind Marco Rubio then, which means that Rubio s collapse in Florida has half deflated Romney s Revolt.Romney continued to dig a hole for himself in Florida before Super Tuesday by recording an automated  Robo-call used to phone prospective Marco Rubio voters in Florida, nearly begging voters to cast ballots for,  a candidate who can defeat Hillary Clinton and who can make us proud. The recorded message went on:  If we Republicans were to choose Donald Trump as our nominee, I believe that the prospects for a safe and prosperous future would be greatly diminished   and I m convinced Donald Trump would lose to Hillary Clinton. Making Robo-calls for a candidate who people were already calling  a Robot , wasn t exactly a smart move by Romney.Far from swinging the election towards Rubio, what Mitt Romney really proved was that money and power can t buy common sense.Ghost RunFor anyone who actually bothered to look close enough, hints of Rubio s collapse were everywhere, but you wouldn t know if from media coverage over the last two months. If not for favorable network face-time on the GOP TV debates, along with Rubio s elite financier backers like billionaire Paul Singer and Cayman hedge fund raider Romney, it s safe to say that Rubio s numbers might had been well below those of his fellow non-starter, Ohio Governor John Kasich.Rubio-linked multi-million dollar Super PAC funds pulled out all the stops against Trump too, launching a social media tidal wave of anti-Trump messages before the Florida primary:If every Rubio supporter makes 1 phone call #MarcoRubio will win!

Unfortunately, no one showed up. TV cameras had to be moved forward into a tiny area around the field s goal posts in order to make the rally look as if more than a few hundred people bothered to show up. Far from jovial and inspirational, the atmosphere was that of deflation and despondency. It was tragic.Rubio stadium event in Hialeah. Stands empty; crowd in one end zone. pic.twitter.com/9zj0xslwSA  Byron York (@ByronYork) March 9, 2016 And when the cameras zoomed-in, it looked like this:The crowd in Hialeah is fired up for @marcorubio tonight! #FLforMarco #FLPrimary pic.twitter.com/e34GsoWWwH  Team Marco (@TeamMarco) March 9, 2016CNN had dispatched one of its intrepid city-dwelling reporters, Jason Carroll, out to Hialeah, Florida to  cover the event. Carrol tried be nice about it, describing the event as  much, much smaller  than a  normal  Rubio event. So much for Marco s homecoming, and so much for Mitt Romney s plan to have Marco win his home state to force a brokered convention in July.If Romney s revolt was ever going to happen, it wasn t going to be in Florida. You d think Mitt s people would ve figured that one out, but there you go (millions are beginning to understand now why Romney performed so poorly in the 2012 election).Jason Carol s cameraman delivered a dim shot of the rally. If there was a church BBQ down the road, it would have drawn a bigger crowd than this.After this debacle last week, Rubio still found the gumption to go on national TV and more or less instruct his supporters to cast their vote for John Kasich in the Ohio primary. Never before in modern American history have we seen presidential candidates instructing their supporters to vote against them in order to derail the party frontrunner in the hopes of triggering a brokered Republican National Convention in July.In reality, a brokered convention means that even if Donald Trump wins the popular votes and the collects the most delegates in the GOP primaries   the Republican Party will call for a vote on the convention floor asking for all delegates to vote again, which in this case would mean that if the combined delegates of Ted Cruz, Marco Rubio and John Kasich exceeds that held by Donald Trump, then Trump would be dumped by his own party s establishment insiders at the convention  in favor of another yet to be determined party elite selection. Most likely this would be Mitt Romney s former running mate, House Speaker Paul Ryan, or one of the other three aforementioned candidates.Great on PaperBefore he was cast-off by the Tea Party purists in favor of Cruz, Rubio had positioned his brand as one of insurgency, but the crowd didn t buy it. So the brand was repositioned as a  safe  choice for voters.When the Rubio vs Trump m l e first started, I had said that this was the inevitable result of the Republican establishment who were,  going for the mathematical and demographically pragmatic option   which would be Marco Rubio, with Wisconsin s Scott Walker throwing early innings in the bull pen. Orthodox RNC thinking last spring believed that Rubio, with less than one term in Senate and no leadership experience, would somehow repeat the  Obama effect  of 2008, and finally usher their party into the 21st century. Things looked very different for Hillary last spring too, where she seemed invincible on the Democrat side as well as in national polling. On paper at least, it seems that Rubio would  tick all the right boxes  for the GOP elite presiding over a party in decline and disarray   young (44 years old, although you d put him at a decade his junior), and even more importantly, Latino, giving the GOP a shot at pulling in a crucial trilateral voter compliment: Hispanic-American, independents and moderate Democrats. On paper this all makes perfect sense, but running for President in the United States of America isn t simply a case of what looks logical on paper. Case and point: Bernie Sanders, Ben Carson and, of course, Donald Trump. It was a truly devastating moment for the Rubio campaign who had raised no less than $70 million so far as part of a desperate establishment bid to market the  Rubio brand . According to a chief strategist for Ohio Gov. John Kasich, Rubio has been  more hyped than Crystal Pepsi,  in reference to Pepsi s 1992 marketing flop. Sen. Rubio has been more hyped than Crystal Pepsi, but he has flopped even worse,  said Weaver last week. Even a well-conceived, high-financed marketing campaign won t work if people don t want to buy the product. That s the Rubio campaign s problem . Behind the nice packaging, voters are discovering there is little substance. Not surprisingly, I don t really like Crystal Pepsi. No one does. But everyone remembers when Coca Cola tried to inflate New Coke, Cherry Coke, and finally Coke Zero, before it completely flopped. Millions were wasted in vain, and it seems that the only people who really benefited from this exercise in hype were the advertising agencies and the production companies who produced them   and also the media networks who sold the ad space to Coca Cola.The same could be said with Rubio, and of course with Jeb Bush and a few others, although Rubio may still live to run another day. Coke didn t give up on Zero. Zero eventually became a Hero (well, according to Coca Cola, anyway) after years and years of marketing capital was invested into that product  which no one was really interested in to begin with.Billionaire Boys ClubBillionaires love to gamble, especially in politics   and they gambled heavily   and lost, on Marco Rubio. One might question the establishment s efficacy in leaving an invisible Rubio in a primary race where he s taking votes away from a more promising challenger in Texas Senator Rafael Edward (Ted) Cruz. Ditto with Kasich.Maybe it s the egos, or maybe Trump is actually pulling the master strings. Either way, the establishment s anti-Trump obsession is tearing the Republican Party apart.Just when you thought it couldn t get any more like a true life black comedy, all three desperate GOP challengers found themselves courting the endorsement of election dropout and former Florida governor, Jeb Bush, on the Thursday before the CNN debate began.As sexy goes, this endorsement hardly registers outside of a few select country clubs. If it were an endorsement from 90 year old Barbara Bush then it might mean something.So poor was Jeb s showing in the primary contest   even after burning through over $100 million in campaign donations (he raised over $150 million) and received around 7% of the vote   it s difficult to see why anyone among Rubio, Cruz and Kasich would be offering a stump for Mr. Excitement, a  low energy  dynastic nonstarter.On balance, this endorsement would probably garner less votes than an endorsement from David Duke. Such is the bizarre and sideshow-like nature of this 2016 presidential election. A NEW AMERICAN CENTURY: Rubio uses Neocon s PNAC and  Israel-first old marketing slogan.Why the Elite Loved RubioLike his globalist colleague Kasich, and despite his evasive comments on the campaign trail, Rubio seems very committed to Wall Street and Bilderberg principles regarding corporate-brokered trade pacts like TPP, TTIP, GAT, and the WTO.On foreign policy, Rubio is a pro-war Republican, calling for regime change in Syria, and even made the incredible comment during one of the GOP s February debates that,  We didn t overthrow Gaddafi, the Libyan people did , having not realized that months of US air bombardment, as well as arming and working with Islamist militants on the ground is what toppled the Libyan state in 2011. Many of these same militants packed up and moved the roadshow to Syria in late 2011 and early 2012. The CIA were active and involved in the repatriation of fighters to Syria and the trafficking of weapons into Syria after the fall of Gaddafi. It would be shocking if Rubio wasn t aware of any of this, especially if he wants to be president of the United States.The other obvious, if not bizarre indicator that the globalists billionaire, military industrial class were firmly backing Rubio was hidden in plain sight. His campaign slogan was  A New American Century , and of course, the significance of this was completely lost on the mainstream media. It seemed that Rubio had stolen his campaign slogan from the likes of Donald Rumsfeld and John Bolton (and Jeb Bush, who also signed the PNAC pledge in 1998) whose neoconservative pro-war think tank, Project for A New American Century (PNAC) was arguably the architect of America s post-9/11 foreign policy. PNAC was also an extension of Israel s foreign policy too, which makes sense considering how aggressively Rubio advocates for Israeli interests.When you actually look at Rubio s record during his time in the Florida legislature, it does not paint a pretty picture at all.Without too much effort, any member of the media, including CNN s Don Lemon, Jake Tapper or Anderson Cooper, could find a substantial trail of dirt behind the young Senator   if only for the fact that Rubio s record seems to be off limits by the media and newspapers like the New York Times   all of whom are devoted to only running critical exposes on Donald Trump. Rubio s dubious track record of scandals and other pieces of corruption are well-known in his home state, but almost invisible nationally. Top of that list might be one David Rivera, a long-time political ally and close friend of Marco Rubio   who also happens to be under investigation by the FBI.That s only the beginning. One of the most telling scandals involved Rubio selling his home to a lobbyist, and getting way over the asking price. On The Issues reports: Rubio s personal finances were questioned because he made a $200,000 profit selling a house he owned to the mother of a chiropractor who was lobbying for a change in state insurance rules. Rubio had been a holdout, but removed a block on the measure shortly after the home sale and voted for it. Rubio was criticized for failing to disclose a home equity loan he received from US Century Bank, whose chairman, Sergio Pino, was a political supporter. The house had been appraised for $185,000, more than the purchase price just 37 days after he bought it. Rubio s staff said the value jumped because he d locked in a lower preconstruction price and made improvements. US Century Bank a large recipient of federal bank bailout money denied making a sweetheart deal. There are a number of other sketchy scandals linking Rubio to Florida s organized crime syndicates, ponzi schemes, including shady deals involving cash payouts and dodgy lobbyists, some of which can be read here. The mainstream media never challenged Rubio on any of these reports, so Rubio never had to defend against them.Then there s the business of Rubio s  sugar daddy , Jewish billionaire and Israeli luminary Norman Braman. Not only is Braman bank-rolling the Rubio political machine (in return for ?), but Brahman s  charity  foundation also employs Marco s wife Jeanette Rubio too. ON BOARD: Rubio with Israeli luminary Shimon Peres.  Brahman is also Rubio s entr e into the Israeli Lobby. It was Brahman who flew Marco and his family to Israel in 2010 to be inducted into the Israeli mind-set. This is also evident through Rubio s pro-Israeli rhetoric, where during one debate he proudly announced,  There can be NO negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians right now In another recent speech, Rubio took things a step further by insinuating that anyone who criticizes Israel is racist, insisting that, All of this anti-Israel action going on globally, it s anti-Semitism. He could easily be speaking as an Israeli envoy, speaking straight off of the lobby s talking script.That s just a snapshot of what sort of political animal Marco Rubio is   not unlike the rest of the pack, and perhaps a lot more shrewd, pushy and cunning than many others. You wouldn t expect anything less by anyone who believes that they deserve to be elected President of the United States having served less than one term in the US Senate at the age of 44.It s not certain yet whether or not Rubio will be able to retain his Florida US Senate seat after announcing he would be campaigning for president last year. Maybe a run for governor in Florida is in the cards.One thing is certain though, at his young age and with powerful backers like the Israeli Lobby   we have not seen the last of Marco Rubio. His talent and ability as a speaker and his potential for a broad-based appeal is undeniable and you can be certain he will remain a key tool for the establishment for many years to come.Just like Coke Zero, with enough marketing muscle and money injected into it, every brand can have a second life.Rubio will return.READ MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files',\n",

       " '(Reuters) - An Illinois law allowing voters in highly populated areas to register to vote at polling places on election day was reinstated on Tuesday by a federal court, pending an appeal of a ruling declaring the statute unfair to people in smaller communities. The state is seeking to overturn a ruling by U.S. District Court Judge Samuel Der-Yeghiayan, which found that the law discriminates against voters in less-populated counties. The law, passed in late 2014 by the Democratic-led legislature and signed into law in early 2015 by former Democratic Governor Pat Quinn, allowed election day voter registration for the first time, including at polling places. But the section of the law regarding polling place registration pertained only to counties with populations of 100,000 or more. The conservative Liberty Justice Center, of Chicago, filed a lawsuit in August, saying the law was discriminatory. Der-Yeghiayan agreed, writing that the law provided an advantage to urban voters over their rural counterparts.  The state of Illinois appealed the ruling last month, and in their order issued Tuesday, a three-judge panel of the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Seventh Circuit granted the state’s request to stay the order until the appeal was adjudicated, court records show. U.S. voters will go to the polls to choose a president, Congressional representatives and other officials on Nov. 8. On Tuesday, the appellate court ordered attorneys on both sides to say by Thursday whether they would like the appeals process to be sped up due to the proximity of the election. ',\n",
       " 'WARSAW (Reuters) - Poland s new prime minister faces a difficult balancing act trying to repair bruised relations with the European Union without alienating the eurosceptic government s core voters. A Western-educated former banker who is fluent in German and English and was sworn in on Monday, Mateusz Morawiecki boasts the credentials needed to negotiate with Brussels. But any compromises to improve relations with Brussels, which sees the ruling Law and Justice (PiS) party as a threat to democracy, would risk upsetting the traditional, Catholic supporters who propelled it into power two years ago. It is a gamble that could backfire, and it is not yet clear how far Morawiecki, 49, and his party, dominated by former Prime Minister Jaroslaw Kaczynski, are ready to go to please Brussels.   The idea to build up international credibility seems rational,  said Jaroslaw Flis, a sociologist at the Jagiellonian University.  But such actions would have to be in complete contrast with what Mateusz Morawiecki would have to do domestically to prevent the PiS from falling apart.  The PiS government has alienated many people at home and abroad with its nationalist rhetoric and changes to state institutions which the EU says subvert the bloc s laws. The European Commission, the EU executive, opened an inquiry into the rule of law in Poland in January 2016 and the European Parliament has started a process that could deprive Poland of its voting rights in the 28-nation bloc. Any hope in Brussels that Morawiecki s appointment signals a change of course by PiS will have been tempered by Polish parliament approving legal changes to the judiciary in defiance of the EU on Friday - the day after his nomination. The changes give parliament, where PiS has a majority, de facto control over the selection of judges. EU leaders looking for clues about Morawiecki s plans will also have taken little comfort from comments he has made since being nominated, making clear he backs a tough line on the EU and believes in PiS s traditional vision of the Polish state.   We want to transform Europe, this is my dream, to re-christianise it,  Morawiecki told the Catholic Radio Maryja broadcaster.  We want Poland to be strong, but also to contain ... Christian values. We will defend them against the background of laicisation and a deepening consumerism.  Asked by the radio interviewer about demands by French President Emmanuel Macron for Poland to face sanctions over a subversion of democratic rules, Morawiecki said he would not  bow down to blackmail.  In comments to parliament on Tuesday, Morawiecki suggested Poland might relent in a conflict with Brussels over logging in an ancient forest, which an EU court has said contravenes EU laws. But he said Poland s national interests came first in any debate over the future of the EU and that he  wholeheartedly  supported PiS s overhaul of the judiciary. Like Beata Szydlo, whom he replaced as prime minister, Morawiecki is likely to have to defer to PiS leader and co-founder Jaroslaw Kaczynski. Prime minister from July 2006 to November 2007, Kaczynski is widely seen as the power behind the party and Poland s main decision-maker. How much scope that will leave Morawiecki to carve out his own path remains to be seen. Former Polish President Lech Walesa, a PiS critic, has suggested that nothing of substance will change.  The circus has stayed the same, only the clowns have changed their roles,  Walesa, who led the Solidarity trade union movement that ended communist rule, said on Twitter.  The appointment of Morawiecki, whose father founded and led a radical offshoot of Solidarity in the 1980s, appears designed in part to present a new face of Poland to the EU. Szydlo, 54, at times responded angrily to EU criticism and relations with the bloc soured under her government. Underlining PiS opposition to Muslim immigration, she said last month Poland wanted to be sure Christian traditions were not subject to  ideological censorship  in the EU. Along with Hungary, Poland has refused to take in any of its quota of the wave of refugees from Syria and elsewhere who have come to Europe since 2015, on the grounds that Muslim immigrants are a threat to national security and stability.         Such comments appeal to core PiS voters, and Szydlo s government, which promised generous welfare payouts and a dedication to traditional Catholic values, was one of Poland s most popular since communist rule ended in 1989. A relative newcomer to politics, Morawiecki lacks Szydlo s broad appeal. But he has overseen significant economic achievements since becoming finance minister in 2016, a position he has retained in the new government. Tusk has welcomed what he sees as signs that Morawiecki is a liberal economist who wants better ties with the EU.  There is no doubt that (Morawiecki s) liberal bias and some pro-western gestures could be a sign that there is a lurking desire to improve relations,  Tusk said last week. But an economic stimulus plan Morawiecki unveiled in 2016 has been criticized by economists who say it depends heavily on private investment, which is low in Poland despite fast economic growth.  What Morawiecki sees as a solution, meaning more political influence in the economy, is actually dangerous,  said Leszek Balcerowicz, a former finance minister who coordinated the transition to a market economy after decades of communist rule. Any hint of protectionism is also likely to worry EU leaders, who seek to break down trade barriers.  Morawiecki has called the privatization of state-owned companies a tragedy and said he will give more power to domestic capital at the expense of foreign investors. In his comments to parliament on Tuesday, he said economic policy should not change.  ',\n",

       " 'MADRID (Reuters) - Spain s High Court said on Tuesday it had granted a U.S. request to extradite Russian citizen Peter Levashov, who is accused of U.S. hacking offences including operating a network of infected computers used by cyber criminals.  Levashov, 36, was arrested while on holiday in Barcelona in April.  U.S. prosecutors have accused him of running the Kelihos botnet, a network of more than 100,000 infected devices used by cyber criminals to distribute viruses, ransomware, phishing emails and other spam attacks. U.S. prosecutors are seeking a 52-year jail sentence against Levashov, who denies the charges against him. The Spanish court said Levashov had three days to lodge an appeal against the extradition decision. Levashov, who is fighting extradition, told the Madrid court last week that he had worked for President Vladimir Putin s United Russia party for the last 10 years, Russia s RIA news agency reported. He told the court that investigators in the United States would torture him for information about his political work if he was sent there to face the charges.  If I go to the U.S., I will die in a year. They want to get information of a military nature and about the United Russia party,  RIA quoted him as saying.  I will be tortured, within a year I will be killed, or I will kill myself.  The Spanish court ruling said that Levashov s lawyers had also alleged a political motivation behind the U.S. request for his extradition and that the real reason behind it may be that he was a programmer who might have  hacked the U.S. elections . U.S. intelligence agencies have concluded that the Kremlin orchestrated a wide-ranging influence operation that included email hacking and online propaganda to discredit Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton and help Donald Trump, a Republican, win the White House last November. The Kremlin denies the allegations. The Spanish court dismissed all the arguments put forward by Levashov and his lawyers against extradition.  Nothing has been proven with respect to the allegations about political motivation and neither ... has the potential infringement of the accused s right to life or of his physical integrity,  the court ruling sad. In an eight-count indictment handed down by a federal grand jury in Connecticut in April, Levashov was charged with causing intentional damage to a protected computer and wire fraud. Russia has lodged its own request for Levashov s extradition from Spain, RIA reported. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Congress, back from vacation on Tuesday, already had its plate full with urgent fiscal and disaster relief issues when President Donald Trump saddled it with deciding the fate of people brought illegally to the United States as children. The future of almost 800,000 young “Dreamers,” protected from deportation by the Obama-era Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) program, now rests with lawmakers who have failed repeatedly to deal effectively with immigration issues. Trump on Tuesday scrapped DACA while giving Congress six months to do something about it. Republican Senator Jeff Flake of Arizona said permanent legislation to fix the immigration system had been Congress’ prerogative all along, and that lawmakers should and could act quickly. “There’s a program, kids are protected by it, they are going to lose that protection if we don’t act,” Flake said. Other critical issues are bearing down on lawmakers. Leading U.S. lawmakers said on Tuesday they were preparing to swiftly approve disaster relief for victims of Hurricane Harvey and two other must-pass priorities: preventing a default on U.S. government debt and avoiding a government shutdown. The House of Representatives was scheduled to consider on Wednesday a first installment of aid for Harvey relief and recovery, about $8 billion, and the Senate’s leadership promised swift action once the House has passed the measure. Senators will then move on to making sure government creditors are paid and avoiding a government shutdown, Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell told the chamber, outlining the agenda for September. “We have to get all three of these things done and we have to do it very quickly.” Republican conservatives were concerned that the various urgent items would be packaged together and rushed through in a way that would prevent lawmakers from attaching conditions that could restrain or even reform government spending. Representative Mark Walker, leader of a large group of House conservatives, said in an interview with Fox News: “For Republicans, we have to be willing to hold the line when it comes to the out-of-control spending.” The Senate’s No. 2 Republican, John Cornyn, said Republican leaders were preparing to attach a measure raising the U.S. debt ceiling - unpopular with conservatives - to the Harvey aid package when it arrives in the Senate, The Hill reported. Such a combined measure would then have to be sent back to the House for approval. “It’s imperative that we get that (Harvey aid) supplemental passed. And the leader has made the decision to attach the debt limit to that, and I support that,” Cornyn told a group of reporters, according to The Hill. The Trump administration has urged that the two measures be combined. The debt ceiling caps how much money the U.S. government can borrow, and many conservatives in Congress are loath to raise it without spending reforms. Representative Mark Meadows, chairman of the conservative House Freedom Caucus, acknowledged on Tuesday evening that conservatives probably did not have the votes to stop a measure combining Harvey aid with a debt ceiling hike. “It will probably pass, with a majority of Democrats and enough Republicans to get it across the finish line,” Meadows said after a meeting of the caucus. Nonetheless, he said the caucus would propose that a requirement capping government spending as a percentage of gross domestic product be attached to the debt ceiling hike. Congress must raise the debt ceiling by early October to stave off an unprecedented U.S. government debt default, which would shake global markets. Lawmakers also need to approve by late September a government funding bill or the government will have to close on Oct. 1. ',\n",
       " 'When Dr. Ben Carson was in the race for the Republican nomination, Donald Trump unleashed a barrage of accusations against the neurosurgeon, going after him aggressively and even comparing him to a pedophile. That s why many were bewildered when Carson endorsed Trump after he dropped out of the race for the nomination. Yet, not only has Carson endorsed Trump s candidacy, he defends Trump and his vile campaign even at the worst of moments.In the latest of a series of bizarre moves, Carson defended Trump s campaign manager Corey Lewandowski during a CNN interview on Thursday, saying that being charged with assault against a female reporter did not make Lewandowski  evil.  Carson said,  I don t see any reason, quite frankly that we should demonize him. If you can come up with a good reason, I ll listen to it. Co-host John Berman pointed out,  Well, look, he s been charged with misdemeanor assault. A lot of people think that is a reason.  Carson then went on a bizarre tangent saying,  A lot of people have been charged with various things. You ve probably been charged with with something too. Maybe with a misdemeanor or something. It doesn t mean that you are an evil horrible person. The stunned Berman responded,  I actually haven t been charged with anything. You have to ask   what in the world did Trump offer Carson to make him sell himself in such a manner? We have to keep in mind that Carson is not only defending Trump, who has spewed racism and bigotry throughout his campaign but in this particular case, he s defending someone who committed assault on camera.The adage  if you can t beat them then join them  is clearly on display here but nothing is worth the price of selling your soul, something Carson has clearly done in this case.

       " 'DUBAI/ISTANBUL/ERBIL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iran halted flights to and from Kurdish regions in northern Iraq on Sunday in retaliation to a plan by the autonomous Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) to hold a referendum on independence. It also started wargames at the Kurdish border. The air embargo is the first concrete retaliatory measure against Monday s Kurdish referendum which is rejected by the government in Baghdad and by Iraq s powerful neighbors, Iran and Turkey. Iranian authorities stopped air traffic to the international airports of Erbil and Sulaimaniya, in Iraqi Kurdistan, upon a request from Baghdad, Fars News Agency said. Tehran and Ankara fear the spread of separatism to their own Kurds. Iran also supports Shi ite groups who have been ruling or holding key security and government positions in Iraq since the 2003 U.S-led invasion which toppled Saddam Hussein.    Turkey, meanwhile, said on Sunday its aircraft launched strikes against Kurdistan Workers Party (PKK) targets in northern Iraq s Gara region on Saturday after spotting militants preparing to attack Turkish military outposts on the border.  Turkey will never ever tolerate any status change or any new formations on its southern borders,  Turkish Prime Minister Binali Yildirim said.  The KRG will be primarily responsible for the probable developments after this referendum. The KRG has resisted calls to delay the referendum by the United Nations, the United States and Britain who fear it could further destabilize the region. The vote, expected to result in a comfortable  yes  to  independence, is not binding and is meant to give the KRG a legitimate mandate to negotiate the secession of the autonomous region with Baghdad and the neighboring countries. The KRG says the vote acknowledges the Kurds  crucial contribution confronting Islamic State after it overwhelmed the Iraqi army in 2014 and seized control of a third of Iraq. Iranian State broadcaster IRIB said military drills, part of annual events held in Iran to mark the beginning of the 1980-1988 war with Iraq, were launched in the Oshnavieh border region.  The war games will include artillery, armored and airborne units, it said. Clashes with Iranian Kurdish militant groups based in Iraq are fairly common in the border area. On Saturday, Turkish warplanes destroyed gun positions, caves and shelters used by PKK militants, a military statement  from Ankara said. Turkey s air force frequently carries out such air strikes against the PKK in northern Iraq, where its commanders are based. Turkey s parliament voted on Saturday to extend by a year a mandate authorizing the deployment of Turkish troops in Iraq and Syria. The PKK launched an insurgency in 1984. More than 40,000 people have been killed in the conflict. It is designated a terrorist group by Turkey, the United States and the European Union. The U.S. embassy in Iraq cautioned its citizens that there may be unrest during a referendum, especially in territories disputed between the KRG and the central government like the multi-ethnic oil-rich region of Kirkuk. Three Kurdish Peshmerga fighters were killed and five wounded on Saturday when an explosive device blew up near their vehicle south Kirkuk, security sources said. The explosion happened in Daquq, a region bordering Islamic State-held areas, the sources said. Islamic State s  caliphate  effectively collapsed in July, when a U.S.-backed Iraqi offensive, in which the Peshmerga took part, captured their stronghold Mosul, in northern Iraq. The group continues to control a pocket west of Kirkuk and a stretch alongside the Syrian border and inside Syria. ',\n",
       " 'This is the hypocrisy to beat all hypocrisies.As we all know, Donald Trump is vehemently anti-immigration. In fact, it s the centerpiece of his campaign going all the way back to June 2015 when he rode an escalator to a podium and delivered a speech officially throwing his hat into the ring.Since then, the Republican nominee has accused immigrants of being criminals who steal jobs from Americans.Well, now it looks like the same can be said of Trump s own wife Melania, who came to the United States from Slovenia.According to an investigation by Politico, Melania may very well have committed visa fraud and other immigration laws. And Trump s campaign has apparently been lying about her immigration story.In January, Melania claimed that she often flew back to Slovenia to renew an H-1B visa, a visa type that Donald Trump despises and has said he would end. It never crossed my mind to stay here without papers,  she told Harper s Bazaar.  That is just the person you are. You follow the rules. You follow the law. Every few months you need to fly back to Europe and stamp your visa. After a few visas, I applied for a green card and got it in 2001. But H-1B visas last three years and can be extended to up to six years, which means the First Lady wannabe did not have to fly back to Slovenia for renewal.As it turns out Melania is describing something people do when they aquire a B-1 Temporary Business Visitor or B-2 Tourist Visa, which means she is lying about the circumstances of her immigration to this country. Furthermore, it could also mean she took a modelling job away from an American citizen because her nude photo shoot occurred in the United States in 1995 and B-1 and B-2 visa holders are not allowed to work here. So Melania may have broken the law.Andrew Greenfield, an attorney specializing in immigration law, made that pretty clear. If you enter the United States with the intention of working without authorization and you present yourself to a border agent at an airport or a seaport or a manned border and request a visa, even if there is not a Q&A   knowing that you are coming to work   you are implicitly, if not explicitly, manifesting that you intend to comply with the parameters of the visa classification for which you sought entry and were granted entry. Another immigration attorney told Politico that if Melania used a B-1 visa she would have had to lie about the purpose of her entry into the country. She would not have been authorized to work in the U.S. while on a B-1 visa. In fact, if a customs agent encounters someone entering the U.S. on a B-1 visa and they know that the individual intends to work for a U.S. employer, the individual will usually be denied admission. In order to avoid being sent back to Slovenia, she may have had to lie about the purpose of her trip. In short, Melania Trump could be guilty of committing visa fraud which is a crime that would seriously jeopardize her green-card status and her United States citizenship.If she were not married to the Republican nominee and were of Hispanic or Muslim descent, Donald Trump would be calling for her to be deported and would be referring to her as an illegal immigrant and a criminal.It sounds like Donald Trump, his wife, and the Republican Party have some serious explaining to do.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Two senior Republican lawmakers said on Sunday they would vote to approve President Donald Trump’s nominee for secretary of state, Rex Tillerson, despite their concerns over the former ExxonMobil chief’s relationship with Russia’s president. “After careful consideration, and much discussion with Mr. Tillerson, we have decided to support his nomination to be secretary of state,” Senators John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina said in a statement.  “Though we still have concerns about his past dealings with the Russian government and (Russian) President Vladimir Putin, we believe that Mr. Tillerson can be an effective advocate for U.S. interests,” said the two senators, veteran foreign policy experts. The Republican-controlled Senate has so far confirmed two of Trump’s nominees for cabinet posts but Tillerson, former chief executive officer at Exxon Mobil Corp, has faced criticism from several prominent Republicans because of his close relationships with Russian officials, including Putin. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said he was confident that all of Trump’s cabinet nominees will be confirmed. Speaking on “Fox News Sunday,” McConnell also said the Senate would confirm a Supreme Court justice nominee eventually picked by Trump. The Senate Foreign Relations Committee is expected to vote on Tillerson’s nomination on Monday, with a full Senate vote coming shortly after. ',\n",
       " 'LIMA (Reuters) - Peru s President Pedro Pablo Kuczynski on Wednesday signaled both his vice presidents would resign if Congress forced him from office, calling an opposition bid to remove him a  coup  attempt that had to be resisted. The rightwing populist party that controls Congress, Popular Force, aims to oust Kuczynski in a vote on Thursday on grounds he is  morally unfit  to govern, after finding he once had business connections with a company at the center of Latin America s biggest graft scandal. Kuczynski, who denies anything improper or illegal, said Popular Force was misusing its majority to attempt a power grab.  The constitution and democracy are under attack. We re facing a coup dressed in supposedly legitimate legal interpretations,  he said in a late night speech on national television.  This is a conviction that my two vice presidents share, because neither wants to be part of a government born of an unjust and anti-democratic maneuver,  Kuczynski said. He was flanked by First Vice President Martin Vizcarra and Second Vice President Mercedes Araoz. If Kuczynski loses Thursday s congressional vote to remove him and his two vice presidents depart as well, new presidential and legislative elections would be called. A 79-year-old former Wall Street banker, Kuczynski has struggled to govern since winning last year s presidential election but only a small share of congressional seats for his center-right party. Popular Force says its efforts to remove him are well within the bounds of the constitution and key to its fight against corruption.  He simply doesn t care about the country,  Popular Force lawmaker Luz Salgado said after Kuczynski s address. Earlier this week, Salgado called for Vizcarra to govern the country through 2021, when Kucyznski s term ends. Vizcarra and Araoz both pledged their loyalty to the center-right president on Wednesday but declined to comment on whether that meant they would resign if he was removed from office. Araoz told Reuters on Sunday that she and Vizcarra would not quit. In recent days, Kuczynski s supporters have increasingly called for his vice presidents to refuse to replace him. They believe new elections would cost Popular Force its majority amid widespread contempt for elected officials as a graft scandal taints much of the country s political class. But investors worry a new ballot could sweep anti-establishment candidates to power in one of Latin America s most stable economies. Kuczynski s government does not think it will come to that, said a government source. It expects about a dozen opposition lawmakers to oppose the motion or abstain from voting, said the source, who spoke on condition of anonymity. Eighty-seven votes are needed to oust Kuczynski. Congress passed the motion to start  presidential vacancy  proceedings last week with 93 votes. On Wednesday, thousands of Peruvians marched in front of Congress to denounce what they saw as Popular Force s bid to exploit the crisis to sabotage country s democratic institutions, pointing to its recent efforts to also oust the attorney general and a justice in the Constitutional Court. Popular Force emerged from the rightwing populist movement started in the 1990s by former President Alberto Fujimori, who is serving a 25-year-sentence for graft and human rights crimes during his autocratic 1990-2000 government. The United States, where Kuczynski once held citizenship, said Peru was a  strong democracy.   We are confident that the Peruvian people and institutions will address this situation according to Peru s constitutional norms,  the U.S. State Department s Bureau of Western Hemisphere Affairs said. The political crisis stems from a disclosure by Brazilian builder Odebrecht [ODBES.UL], which has landed elites in jail from Colombia to the Dominican Republic since acknowledging bribing officials across the region for much of the century. Responding to a request by Congress, Odebrecht said it paid more than $4 million to consulting companies owned by Kuczynski or a close business associate for about a decade starting in 2004. Some deposits were made to a company Kuczynski owned while he was minister in a government that awarded Odebrecht lucrative contracts. Odebrecht said Saturday that there was no indication the transactions were part of its past corrupt dealings with politicians, which it can only discuss with prosecutors. Kuczynski once strenuously denied ever having any ties with Odebrecht. He has since apologized to Peru for not disclosing his connections with the company, blaming forgetfulness and poor organization of his personal records after decades of work in finance and public administration. But he said there was nothing improper about the payments.  Being careless and sloppy is a defect but it is not...a tool for dishonesty and much, much less, for crime,  Kuczynski said. Kuczynski had once raised hopes that his decades of finance and public administration experience would usher in a new period of investments to spur faster economic growth in the world s No.2 copper producer. But in a sign of how the crisis has engulfed his government, Peru postponed an auction of a $2 billion copper project, scheduled for Wednesday, until February.  ',\n",
       " 'MANILA (Reuters) - Thousands of Filipinos rallied on Thursday to denounce Philippines President Rodrigo Duterte and warn of what they called an emerging dictatorship, in a major show of dissent against the controversial but hugely popular leader. Politicians, indigenous people, priests, businessmen, and left-wing activists held marches and church masses accusing Duterte of authoritarianism and protesting at policies including a ferocious war on drugs that has killed thousands. Signs saying  Stop The Killings  and  No To Martial Rule  reflected fears that Duterte would one day deliver on his threat to declare nationwide military rule like that imposed by late dictator Ferdinand Marcos. The rallies marked the 45th anniversary of the start of that era, remembered by many Filipinos as brutal and oppressive. Effigies of Duterte were burned, including one which bore both his face and that of late Nazi leader Adolf Hitler.  A protester with a toy gun played dead on the ground in a reenactment of one of a spree of drug-related killings that activists say are executions staged by police. Police reject those allegations. Anti-Duterte Senator Risa Hontiveros said democracy was under threat by a  Dutertatorship  with a  policy of killing . Vice President Leni Robredo, who was not Duterte s running mate, said Filipinos should recognize signs of  rising tyranny .   It s sad that we seemed to have not learned our lessons,  Robredro said.  There s a culture of violence around us.  Marcos declared martial law in 1972 and held power for 14 years until his removal in a bloodless, army-backed  people s power  uprising. He abolished democratic institutions and was accused of killing, torturing and  disappearing  thousands of opponents.  Duterte has expressed admiration for Marcos. His critics are alarmed by his autocratic rhetoric and a vicious disdain for his detractors. But he won last year s election by a big margin and has maintained one of the highest public approval ratings of a Philippines president. Several thousand turned out on Thursday to show their support for Duterte at a rival rally that entertained crowds with live music, dancing and food.  This is to tell the people that  here we are, we are the majority who are happy with the government and not those few who are just griping ,  said rally organizer Benny Antiporda, a former journalist. Millions of Filipinos admire Duterte s down-to-earth style, his decisiveness and even his imperfections. His supporters at home and among the diaspora see him as a champion of ordinary people and the best hope for change that presidents from the political elite failed to bring. The anti-Duterte demonstrators criticized his pro-China stance and the destruction in southern Marawi City by military air strikes targeting Islamist militants. Others decried what they see as his cozy relationship with the still-powerful Marcos family.  It seems that what we fought for in 1972, is again back. The total disrespect for human life, dignity, human rights. And that was how we started,  said Rene Saguisag, a former senator and human rights lawyer.  In some ways, it may be worse.  ',\n",

       " 'The sweep of crazy anti-transgender bathroom laws has brought out the bigots in droves. One such bigot is Texas police officer Tracy Murphree, who is also potentially in the running to become Sheriff of an entire county in the Lone Star state. Murphree decided to post to Facebook his feelings on transgender women   and that s not all. This cop actually said that he would beat any transgender woman in a public restroom with his daughter until she lost consciousness. This whole bathroom thing is craziness I have never seen. All I can say is this: If my little girl is in a public women s restroom and a man, regardless of how he may identify, goes into the bathroom, he will then identify as a John Doe until he wakes up in whatever hospital he may be taken to. Your identity does not trump my little girl s safety. I identify as an overprotective father that loves his kids and would do anything to protect them. Luckily, Murphree was quickly put in his place by Amber Dyden Briggle, who once ran for Denton County Council. She also happens to have a transgender son. Briggle responded to Murphee: As the parent of a transgender child who is only 8 years old, Tracy, this   really, really upsets me,  she wrote.  I know you are a protective parent, but SO AM I. If my son were to walk into a women s room, looking the way he does, he would no doubt be corrected and sent to the men s room. What we ve done now is call attention to a young child, only 8 years old, who is now behind closed doors with a bunch of men   had he walked in there to use the bathroom to pee in the first place, no one would have batted an eye, because he looks like and IS a boy.  Let me put it another way: halfway through first grade, this PERFECT child of mine, who is just as miraculous and amazing today as he was on the day of his birth, stopped feeling comfortable using the girls  room. But, of course, the bigoted Murphree doubled down on his hatred and said that Briggle is the problem, not him: Amber, you have demonstrated part of the problem. You advocate your right to defend your child and state that your child has the right to pee in peace. Yet when I advocate my right to defend my child and her right to pee in peace I m a bigot and dangerous. I m not a bigot I have nothing against you or your child. I would defend both of you with my life. Yes, I will be the next sheriff, and I will serve all citizens. I will not sit back and not voice my beliefs and opinions. I will not give in to the political correctness police. I won t be threatened by those who may call me a bigot or ignorant. I have no issue with transgenders. That s between them and God. The few transgenders rights do not trump the rights of the many. I will not stand by in political correctness afraid of being labeled and allow a male to enter a bathroom my daughter occupies. I just won t do it. Mr. Murprhee is the last person who should be on any police force. He has shown himself to be violent against those he hates and/or does not understand. He is incapable of listening to logic and reason, or of learning to be accepting of diverse groups of people. This man is dangerous. He has explicitly said that he will harm his constituents for the  crime  of using a public bathroom.Denton County, please do NOT elect this violent brute as your next sheriff.Featured image via Wikimedia',\n",

       " 'TOKYO (Reuters) - Israel is willing to resort to military action to ensure Iran never acquires nuclear weapons, the intelligence minister said on Thursday in Japan where he is seeking backing for U.S. President Donald Trump s tougher line on Tehran. Trump said on Oct. 13 he would not certify Iran is complying with an agreement on curtailing its nuclear program, signed by his predecessor, Barack Obama, opening a 60-day window for Congress to act to reimpose sanctions.  If international efforts led these days by U.S. President Trump don t help stop Iran attaining nuclear capabilities, Israel will act militarily by itself,  Intelligence Minister Israel Katz said in an interview in Tokyo.  There are changes that can be made (to the agreement) to ensure that they will never have the ability to have a nuclear weapon.  Israel has taken unilateral action in the past without the consent of its major ally, the United States, including air strikes on a suspected nuclear reactor in Syria in 2007 and in Iraq in 1981. A strike against Iran, however, would be a risky venture with the potential to provoke a counter strike and roil financial markets. An Israeli threat of military strikes could, nonetheless, galvanize support in the United States for toughening up the nuclear agreement but it could also backfire by encouraging hardliners in Iran and widening a rift between Washington and European allies. So far, none of the other signatories to the deal - Britain, France, Germany, Russia, China, Iran and the European Union - has cited serious concerns, leaving the United States isolated. Japan relies on the U.S. military to help defend it against threats from North Korea and elsewhere. Tokyo s diplomatic strategy in the Middle East, where it buys almost all its oil, is to maintain friendly relations with all countries, including Iran.   I asked the Japanese government to support steps led by President Trump to change the nuclear agreement,  said Katz, who is a member of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu s right-wing Likud party.  The question of whether Japanese companies will begin to work in Iran or not is a very important question.  Katz s visit to Tokyo comes ahead of a planned trip by Trump from Nov. 5 for a summit with Prime Minister Shinzo Abe. Officials at Japan s Ministry of Foreign Affairs were not immediately available to comment. Israel, Katz said, wants the nuclear agreement to be revised to remove an expiration date, and to impose tighter conditions to stop Tehran from developing new centrifuges used to make weapons-grade nuclear material.  He also urged sanctions to stop Iran from establishing  Syria as a military base to launch attacks on Israel and action to put a halt to Tehran s development of ballistic missiles.  We will not allow Iran to transform Syria into forward base sea harbors, air bases and Shia militias,  he said.  We will act together with the United States and other countries in the world until they stop the ballistic missiles that threaten Israel.   The U.S. House of Representatives on Wednesday backed new sanctions on Lebanon s Iran-backed Hezbollah militia.  ',\n",
       " 'SEATTLE (Reuters) - U.S. Defense Secretary Ash Carter Thursday urged Congress to stick to a bipartisan budget agreement that locked in spending levels for fiscal 2016 and 2017, warning that reopening the deal would lead to inefficiencies and could raise concerns overseas. Carter told military leaders and industry at an event hosted by Microsoft Corp that the Department of Defense needed greater stability to plan its spending levels and prepare for the complex challenges it faces around the world. “We’ve got to come together in Washington and break the gridlock for such important functions as funding the federal government,” Carter said. “We can’t go in every fiscal year with chaos and continuing resolutions. That’s a money waster ... because it causes us to manage inefficiently.” Carter said he worried that Congress could undermine the two-year budget agreement that set funding levels for this fiscal year and the one that begins Oct. 1. “I really hope the bipartisan budget agreement sticks,” Carter said, noting that it was even more difficult to maintain such deals in a presidential election year. U.S. defense officials worry that Republican moves to add funding to the Pentagon’s fiscal 2017 budget plan could jeopardize the budget deal. Carter said the turbulence caused by recent budget battles was not helpful for managing the Pentagon and gave allies and potential enemies the false impression that the U.S. military was in disarray when it was actually investing well overall.

       " 'You know how Donald Trump has been trying to convince us that Steve Bannon is a great guy and his publication, Breitbart, is just a news website that isn t a haven for white supremacists, white nationalists, and a diverse array of racists, bigots, and people who are fine with racism? Well, that s going to be just a teensy bit harder now after the publication was banned by an ad vendor for hate speech. Breitbart is just a publication,  Trump said in a recent interview with the New York Times.  They are certainly a much more conservative paper, to put it mildly, than the New York Times. But Breitbart really is a news organization that has become quite successful. It s got readers, and it does cover subjects on the right, but it covers subjects on the left also. It s a pretty big thing. There s no question that Breitbart is a  big thing,  but that s not exactly a good thing when it s something that Bannon himself described Breitbart as the  platform for the alt-right,  a term used to describe white supremacists who took a day off of abusing methamphetamines to throw on a suit and complain about the plight of white people in a seemingly legitimate setting. Nevertheless, Trump says he would never have hired Bannon had he any indicator (like an admission from Bannon that he runs a large platform for white supremacists) that he was alt-right: I ve known Steve Bannon a long time. If I thought he was a racist, or alt-right   I wouldn t even think about hiring him. The Donald says that he intends to get to the bottom of what is energizing the extreme Right (him) and find out why (because he appeals to racists).Trump s decision to appoint a white nationalist to a high-level position spurred AppNexus, a major advertising technology provider, to look into what sort of operation Bannon had birthed   and they didn t like what they found:AppNexus Inc., a major advertising technology provider, has barred Breitbart News from using its ad-serving tools because the conservative online publisher violated its hate speech rules.AppNexus scrutinized Breitbart s website after U.S. President-Elect Donald Trump tapped Steve Bannon, former executive chairman of Breitbart, to be White House chief strategist last week. The digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence, said AppNexus spokesman Joshua Zeitz. We did a human audit of Breitbart and determined there were enough articles and headlines that cross that line, using either coded or overt language,  he said.Bloomberg notes that while Breitbart does not buy ads from AppNexus directly, the ban means that they will not receive ads from the ad server the company runs and this will likely lower the price of ads on the site   which means less money for the modern day Neo-Nazis.Will more advertising companies follow suit? Only time will tell   but the pressure is certainly on!Featured image via Getty Images (Ben Jackson)',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - The Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation will shut down its fundraising affiliates in Sweden and the United Kingdom if Hillary Clinton wins the U.S. presidency in November, a spokesman for the global charity said this week. The foundation has in recent weeks begun announcing planned new donor restrictions to allay criticism that wealthy supporters might be expecting special treatment from the U.S. government in return. Both the William J. Clinton Foundation UK in London and the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse in Stockholm will close if Clinton becomes president because of their acceptance of foreign funding, Brian Cookstra, a spokesman for the Clinton Foundation in New York, said in one of a series of emails responding to questions from Reuters. Both organizations exist to receive donations overseas, neither have any employees, and they are overseen by board members of the main Clinton Foundation in the United States, their financial statements show. Some of the foundation’s foreign outposts have drawn extra scrutiny because donors can give money anonymously.  The foundation said last month it would no longer accept foreign funding for at least some of its work if Clinton is elected, although Donald Trump, Clinton’s Republican rival for the presidency, continues to accuse Clinton of being corrupted by foreign donors. She has dismissed this as a political smear. In order to become President Barack Obama’s secretary of state in 2009, Clinton signed an ethics agreement promising to annually publish the names of all donors to her family’s philanthropy, including foreign governments that have collectively given tens of millions of dollars.  Clinton also promised that her charities would seek prior approval from the State Department’s ethics office before accepting new donations from foreign governments. The charities have since conceded they did not keep these promises, blaming oversights. (reut.rs/2c7iqgk) The foundation’s outpost in Stockholm has received nearly 270 million Swedish crowns, about $30 million, since it was established in 2011, while Clinton was still secretary of state.  Most of this money was given by the Swedish Postcode Lottery and the Dutch Postcode Lottery, according to the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse’s website. About $6 million came from other donors that are not disclosed by the Clinton Foundation Insamlingsstiftelse. Cookstra said those donors were included in the donor list published on the main Clinton Foundation’s website but declined to identify them or say why they were donating in Sweden rather than the United States. The foundation also declined to explain a discrepancy in donations in records from 2012. The Swedish Postcode Lottery Foundation said it donated 6.6 million crowns (about $1 million) that year, but the Clinton Foundation reported this amount as 19.7 million crowns (about $3 million). Cookstra also declined to say whether the foundation has other fundraising arms set up in foreign countries besides the United Kingdom and Sweden. The British arm of the Clinton Foundation has raised at least $400,000 since 2007, according to records held by the British government’s Charity Commission. The State Department says it has no record of being notified about the foundation’s overseas outposts during Clinton’s tenure. “The State Department was not responsible for monitoring or approving the organization and operation of the Clinton Foundation or its offshoots,” Elizabeth Trudeau, a department spokeswoman, said in a statement. “The Department reviewed all information submitted to it. You would need to ask the Foundation whether there were additional matters that it should have submitted for State Department review.” ',\n",
       " 'MANILA (Reuters) - Philippine lawmakers on Wednesday said they would hold more hearings before deciding whether to confirm the appointment of the country s environment minister, although some said they were likely to approve the step. The confirmation of Environment and Natural Resources Secretary Roy Cimatu is being closely watched given the policy implications for the mining sector in the world s top nickel ore supplier. Cimatu, a former soldier, replaced staunch environmentalist Regina Lopez who was rejected by the same legislative panel in May after less than a year in office. All ministerial appointments in the country go through a similar process. During her term, Lopez ordered the closure or suspension of 26 of the nation s 41 mines and banned open-pit mining, measures that Cimatu has not reversed. He has said his team was still reviewing the closure and suspension orders.  I am not pessimistic about his confirmation, but we need additional hearings,  Senator Tito Sotto, part of the 25-member Commission on Appointments, told reporters.     Apart from Sotto, two other senators, Juan Miguel Zubiri and Gregorio Honasan, also expressed support for Cimatu.  This is a proud moment for me,  Honasan, also a former soldier, said at the hearing.  I can vouch for his competence and integrity.  The next hearing is set for Sept. 27. Mining is a contentious issue in largely underexplored Philippines following past examples of environmental mismanagement. In 1996, a tailings leak at Canadian-owned Marcopper Mining Corp s copper mine in Marinduque contaminated rivers. The sector contributes less than 1 percent to the economy, with only 3 percent of the 9 million hectares identified by the state as having high mineral reserves being mined, according to government data.

       " 'Donald Trump has the maturity of a toddler, and he certainly put it on full display early Wednesday morning.Completely ruining the tone he was trying to set after traveling to Texas with First Lady Melania to visit the devastation the area was left in after Hurricane Harvey, Trump decided to go back to his childish antics and reignite his ongoing feud with the media. Attacking  dying magazines , Trump said: After reading the false reporting and even ferocious anger in some dying magazines, it makes me wonder, WHY? All I want to do is #MAGA! Of course, let s for a second just ignore the fact that Trump loves painting himself as a victim, or the fact that several mainstream media networks are actually soaring and doing better than ever thanks to their anti-Trump reporting and coverage. It was the last line of Trump s ridiculous, whiny tweet where he stated  All I want to do is #MAGA  that gained the most attention   and the reactions were pretty damn hilarious. Here are just some of the best responses:   Apparently, Twitter users had a field day, as they often do whenever Trump displays how undeserving he is to be the leader of the free world. Trump never fails to humiliate America with his blatantly unprofessional behavior, and his Twitter account alone is a major source of anxiety and embarrassment for Americans throughout the country. As long as Trump has access to social media, he could humiliate or endanger the country at any moment and unfortunately, this behavior has become so common that we just expect this insanity from Trump on a daily basis now.Trump has done nothing to #MAGA, and shows no real genuine interest in improving the country beyond his own personal gain and that of his rich privileged friends.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'When Donald Trump began his one-man quest to smear the judge presiding over his Trump University lawsuit using appalling racial rhetoric, it was offensive but not surprising. After all, this is a man who began his campaign by labeling Mexicans  rapists  and  murderers  in his very first speech. What was surprising was the sheer level of cowardice on display from Trump s fellow Republicans. Faced with a candidate who said Muslims and Mexicans can t be his judge, conservative politicians tried to distance themselves from the comments, but not actually call it what it is: Racism.Sen. Mitch McConnell, for example, managed to avoid the term  racism  a total of three times in one interview. The sidestepping was so egregious that it prompted Senate Minority Leader Harry Reid to call McConnell out on the Senate floor as an example of  Republican spinelessness.  Likewise, many other Republicans released statements saying they found the comments  unacceptable  but never articulated why. The vagueness was surely intentional. It s going to be hard to win a general election in an increasingly diverse America when your candidate is openly spewing racism. Standing up to that sort of hate mongering would take courage   and that s something that is solely lacking in today s GOP.However, one man who seems to have little interest in the toeing the party line for an unapologetic bigot is Sen. Ben Sasse (R-Neb.) who said what his fellow Republicans were thinking but terrified to say: Donald Trump s smears on his judge are racism. It s as clear as day.Public Service Announcement:Saying someone can\\'t do a specific job because of his or her race is the literal definition of \"racism.\"  Ben Sasse (@BenSasse) June 6, 2016Sasse isn t wrong. Trump has repeatedly said that the judge in his case is out to get him because of his  Mexican heritage.  Judge Curiel isn t Mexican, he was born in Indiana, but the very fact that he is of Hispanic ethnicity makes him suspect in Trump s eyes. In a sit down with CNN s Jake Tapper, Trump admits as much:Tapper: I don t care if you criticize him. That s fine. You can criticize every [legal] decision. What I m saying is, if you invoke his race as a reason why he can t do his job Trump: I think that s why he s doing it!Sasse is one of the few Republicans left who hasn t caved to the pressure to stand behind Trump as the nominee. Unfortunately for the Republicans that had hoped to cower behind their wall of silence and ride this out, Sasse made that all but impossible. Trump s comments are the  literal definition of  racism\\'  and they need to own up to that or risk looking complicit in those statements. Sasse has given them an opportunity to come clean. It s now up to them to take it.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'SAN FRANCISCO/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Alphabet’s Google is racing to hire more conservatives for its lobbying and policy arm, trying to get a foothold in President-elect Donald Trump’s Washington after enjoying a uniquely close relationship with the administration of President Barack Obama. In the weeks since the Nov. 8 election, Google has ramped up efforts to hire Republican lobbying firms and in-house lobbyists to change the composition of its Washington office, according to three lobbyists with knowledge of the matter.  The company also posted an advertisement for a manager for conservative outreach and public policy partnership, seeking a “liaison to conservative, libertarian and free market groups.”      While the position is not new, it gives Google a chance to make a hire that reflects the new political climate. Conservatives already are represented in the office. A Google spokeswoman declined to comment on the record for this article. Chief Executive Officer Larry Page of Alphabet (GOOGL.O), Google’s parent company, is expected to be in the room on Wednesday when Trump convenes a gathering of leaders of some of the largest technology companies in his New York headquarters. The session, organized by Trump son-in-law Jared Kushner, adviser Reince Priebus and Trump supporter and tech financier Peter Thiel, is billed as an introductory meeting that would not result in any job or investment announcements, two sources briefed on the talks said. Others attending are Apple Inc (AAPL.O) Chief Executive Officer Tim Cook, Facebook Inc (FB.O) Chief Operating Officer Sheryl Sandberg, Amazon.com (AMZN.O) CEO Jeff Bezos, Tesla Motors Inc (TSLA.O) CEO Elon Musk, Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) CEO Satya Nadella and Oracle CEO Safra Catz, according to sources familiar with the session plans.  The Information Technology Industry Council, a trade group whose members include Google, Apple, Facebook and Amazon, had a conference call last Friday to discuss policy objectives it could agree on to present to Trump, according to a person familiar with the call. Trump clashed with Silicon Valley on several issues during the election campaign, including immigration, government surveillance and encryption. His surprise victory alarmed many companies, which fear he might follow through on his pledges. Trump has also opposed the Obama administration’s “net neutrality” rules, ordered in 2015 by the communications regulator to reclassify broadband internet services to treat them more like public utilities. The rule is now said to be headed for a reversal. Liberal-leaning Silicon Valley bet heavily on Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton winning the White House, and many technology companies have found themselves scrambling in the wake of Trump’s election. But Google, which forged deep ties to the Obama White House and was the largest corporate contributor to Clinton’s campaign, appears to have been caught especially off guard, Washington insiders said.  Only 33 employees of Google and its parent company Alphabet donated $201 or more to Trump, for a total of $23,300. Clinton received donations from 1,359 Google or Alphabet employees for a total of $1.6 million. Google NetPAC, the company’s political action committee, made 56 percent of its contributions to Republicans in the 2016 election cycle, according to data from the Center for Responsive Politics. During Obama’s presidency, more than 250 people moved between jobs at Google or related firms and the federal government, national political campaigns and Congress, according to a report this year by the Campaign for Accountability, a watchdog group. The company notched several wins during the administration, including favorable policies on net neutrality.  Google seemed poised to enjoy similar treatment under a Clinton administration. Schmidt was seen wearing a staff badge at Clinton’s election night party, a sign of their close relationship. But those ties are now something of a liability as the company tries to re-position its presence, lobbyists said. The hiring push will adjust the political makeup of Google’s Washington office, where the team of lobbyists for Congress and the agencies contains more Democrats than Republicans, according to people familiar with the operation. Such a skew is not unusual given that Democrats controlled the White House the past eight years. To be sure, conservatives are well-represented in the company’s Washington office: Susan Molinari, a former Republican congresswoman from New York, has been the top lobbyist since 2012, and Seth Webb, who worked for a former Republican speaker of the house, helps lead Congressional lobbying.  But the company has tended toward moderate Republicans in past hiring. Its previous director of conservative outreach was alumnus of Mitt Romney’s 2012 presidential campaign, and a number of former staffers for Sen. John McCain have passed through the office as well. But the company still has to reconcile the lobbyists it hires with its liberal-leaning existing staff. Said one lobbyist for a rival tech company, “I think they are going to have a tough time really finding the cultural fit.” ',\n",

Trump used the start of a speech about education at a charter school in Cleveland to push back at Democratic rival Hillary Clinton’s statement that his position on Iraq is pretty much like her own: She voted for the 2003 war as a U.S. senator from New York but has since disavowed the vote. At an NBC forum on Wednesday night, Clinton pointed to a September 2002 interview Trump gave to radio host Howard Stern to say that Trump had supported the war. Trump had said “Yeah, I guess so,” when asked about a potential conflict in Iraq.  Various fact-checkers have cited this interview to debunk Trump’s statement that he was always against the war. In Cleveland, Trump cited a Jan. 28, 2003, interview he did with Fox News’ Neil Cavuto to say he was skeptical. In that interview, Trump said: “I think the Iraqi situation is a problem. And I think the economy is a much bigger problem as far as the president is concerned.” He said in his Cleveland remarks that the withdrawal of U.S. troops from Iraq had left a power void filled by Islamic State militants. “But I was opposed to that war from the beginning, long before my interview with Howard Stern,” Trump said. He also cited what he said was a March 25, 2003, interview. “Just days after the war started, I was quoted as saying the war is a mess,” Trump said, calling it “more evidence that I had opposed the war from the start.” ',\n",

Bernie Sanders (I-Vt.), the only other declared Democratic candidate for President, is even further behind with 7.4 percent. Former Maryland Gov. Martin O Malley, who is expected to announce his bid on May 30, fares the worst against Clinton with 1.2 percent of support from likely voters.The first lady is highly unlikely to mount a presidential campaign, however. In fact, of the people surveyed by Rasmussen, just 14 percent thought she should run.Still, 40 percent of black voters welcomed the idea of her running, and she bests Clinton among those voters, with 44 percent support among African-Americans compared with 36 percent for Clinton.Obama herself recently joked about a possible October surprise, hinting to  Late Show  host David Letterman that the thought had crossed her mind.Via: The Hill',\n",

       " 'BANGKOK (Reuters) - Thai Prime Minister Prayuth Chan-ocha said on Tuesday he would use a special order that gives the military sweeping powers to allow political parties to prepare for next year s general election.  Major parties had urged the government for months to lift a ban on political activity, which has been in place since a 2014 coup, to allow them to get ready for the vote. Prayuth, who is also head of the junta, said he would use the special order, known as Article 44, to solve a political deadlock.  The government will have to use Article 44 to solve this problem (political activity deadlock),  Prayuth told reporters, referring to a constitutional clause that grants the military absolute powers. Government spokesperson Sansern Kaewkamnerd said Prayuth would allow parties to take some steps outlined in Thailand s new constitution, including reviewing their membership list and ensuring they have at least 500 members to qualify them to run in the November 2018 poll.  The meeting is not considering lifting the ban on political activities at the moment,  Sansern said. The military has been running Thailand since the May 2014 coup when it ousted the civilian government of Prime Minister Yingluck Shinawatra, ending years of political turmoil, including pro- and anti-government street protests.  A coup in 2006 ousted Yingluck s brother, former Prime Minister Thaksin Shinawatra, whose supporters have dominated the polls since 2001. The 2014 coup saw some Western countries downgrade ties with Bangkok. Earlier this month, the European Union said it would resume political contact  at all levels  with Thailand after putting relations on hold. That announcement came after Prayuth said a general election would he held next November.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate voted on Thursday to bolster travel security in the wake of the Brussels attacks with measures that include doubling the number of transportation security teams with bomb-sniffing dogs at domestic airports and other transit hubs. Lawmakers voted overwhelmingly to add security measures to a separate bill that calls for renewing the programs of the Federal Aviation Administration through September 2017. The FAA bill is expected to come up for a final vote later this month.    After Republicans and Democrats reached a deal on security measures earlier in the day, lawmakers voted to raise the number of Visible Intermodal Prevention Response, or VIPER, teams within the Transportation Security Administration from 31 to 60. VIPER teams, which are intended as a visible deterrent to attacks, can be deployed at airports and train or bus stations. Other measures would bolster the vetting of airport employees, add security to vulnerable check-in and baggage claim areas and authorize the TSA to donate security equipment to foreign airports with direct flights to the United States. The approved provisions would also order a new U.S. assessment of foreign cargo security programs and provide grant money to train state, local and foreign authorities in how to respond to mass-casualty and “active shooter” incidents. It is unclear what kind of reception the FAA bill, if passed by the Senate, might receive in the House of Representatives. House lawmakers have been considering their own FAA legislation. That bill also calls for the privatization of the U.S. air traffic control system, a measure that is not in the Senate’s legislation.  ',\n",

I think they need to point the finger somewhere else The Baltimore school system ranked second among the nation s 100 largest school districts in how much it spent per pupil in fiscal year 2011, according to data released Tuesday by the U.S. Census Bureau.The city s $15,483 per-pupil expenditure was second to New York City s $19,770. Rounding out the top five were Montgomery County, which spent $15,421; Milwaukee public schools at $14,244; and Prince George s County public schools, which spent $13,775.The Census Bureau also noted the first decrease in per-pupil spending nationally since 1977, the year the figures were first tracked.The per-pupil expenditures were calculated based on taking the districts  current spending on day-to-day operations and deducting payments to charter schools and capital funding. The remaining money was divided by the number of students enrolled in traditional schools. The amounts were not adjusted for inflation.Baltimore schools CEO Andr s Alonso said the city s total could have reflected large infusions of cash to the district, including millions in federal stimulus dollars and federal Race to the Top funds.He also credited state lawmakers for maintaining funding. As many states pulled back on spending, with many districts losing funding, Maryland held the line on education, which is why you see three districts at or near the top,  he said.On Monday, the school board passed a $1.2 billion budget that includes per-pupil funding of $5,190. That amount is different from what the Census Bureau reported because the school system takes out other expenses, such as transportation costs and special-education services, before allocating money to individual schools. In addition, the school system provides extra funding for certain groups of students, such as those in special education and dropout-prevention programs.Via: Baltimore Sun',\n",
       " \"Does your child spend time on social media? Unless they re Amish, you should probably assume they do. My teenage daughter just shared with me one of the most racist, self-loathing articles with me that I have ever seen in print. This is the most hateful, racist articles aimed at shaming young, white Americans that you ve have ever seen. As we took a closer look at students featured in this  Buzzfeed  article, we were stunned by some of the racist postings we found on their social media accounts.I suppose it s okay for Buzzfeed to publish an article with the sole purpose of bashing its young white users, because thanks to Barack and Michelle Obama (the ultimate victims), who have been sowing the seeds of racism, division and hate from the White House, it s perfectly acceptable to trash white Americans. Never mind that Barack Obama is the President of the United States. What black United States President who was elected twice by a majority white nation would still consider himself and his wife victims of racism?  Here are some of the examples we found from the Buzzfeed article titled:  19 School Powerpoint Presentations That Give Zero F*cks  This article, and hundreds more just like it, show up in your children s Snapchat social media feeds, a place where teenagers and young adults frequently go to interact with each other, and where they are constantly bombarded with leftist indoctrination garbage like this: Controversial Tay  appears to be very proud of herself and how she s stirring it up at school, she actually goes as far as to say,  One day I feel like my professors just gon stop letting me do presentations.

She quickly turns it into a race issue, using his statement about the controlling the borders to suggest he,  doesn t want too many Latinos in our country.  She tells him  because you are white and you are so closed-minded  that he  doesn t accept the truth.  The teacher calls her out on her previous statement that,  white people are in control of everything,  by asking her what color our current President is? Watch how she quickly blames Congress for being white, which apparently makes a black man who holds the highest office in our nation somehow insignificant.

Many of our educators are also indoctrinating our children with the,  all white s are racists  narrative. When are parents going to start taking a stand, and tell the educators at the schools their children attend they are not going to stand by and watch them shame their children? It may be all the rage in high schools and colleges to unfairly accuse white people of racism and hate, but that doesn t mean you, or your kids have to go along with it.For the entire slide show, go to Buzzfeed. Make sure to leave a comment, and let them know how you feel about the garbage they re putting out to your kids disguised as  news.  Teenagers and young adults have a hard enough time dealing with self-image and everyday teenage insecurities. Suicide rates and depression are off the charts for teens. Buzzfeed is just doing their part to pile on, and make your kids feel guilty or ashamed for the color of skin they were born with. \",\n",

Not only is there zero evidence to support this claim, but thimerosal isn t even used in vaccines anymore. This article, which was published in both Rolling Stone and Salon, also alleged a vast conspiracy to hide this link.Science writer Seth Mnookin explained in his book,  The Panic Virus,  that if Kennedy s claims were true, this would mean scientists and officials in governmental agencies, nonprofit organizations, and publicly held companies around the world would need to be part of a coordinated multi-decade scheme to prop up  the vaccine industry s bottom line  by masking the dangers of thimerosal.  Salon eventually withdrew Kennedy s article.Ten years later, in 2015, Kennedy promoted the film,  Trace Amounts,  which drew the same faulty conclusions about vaccines causing autism as his book. The film told viewers,  They get the shot, that night they have a fever of a hundred and three, they go to sleep, and three months later their brain is gone. This is a holocaust, what this is doing to our country. The implications of a president who doesn t believe in science and is willing to set policy based on conspiracy theories that have been repeatedly debunked is terrifying, and could well prove deadly.The following chart shows the number of measles cases in the U.S. between 1950 and 2007.

       " '(Reuters) - South Dakota would be the first U.S. state to dictate what bathrooms transgender students are allowed to use in public schools if Republican Governor Dennis Daugaard signs a bill into law.  The state Senate on Tuesday voted 20-15 to send a bill to Daugaard that requires transgender pupils to use restrooms and locker rooms in public schools that correspond to their gender at birth and not the gender that fits their current identity, legislative records showed. “This bill is about protecting young children who are too innocent ... to understand the complexity of life,” Republican Senator David Omdahl said before voting for the bill.  Staff in Daugaard’s office were not immediately available for comment. Daugaard has said that he will research the issue before deciding whether to sign the legislation, local media reported.   The bill also requires schools to provide “reasonable” accommodations for transgender students. Those accommodations include a single-occupancy restroom, a unisex restroom, or the controlled use of a restroom, locker room or shower room.      “South Dakota lawmakers are sending a message that it’s okay to segregate, humiliate, and bully transgender students,” the American Civil Liberties Union said in an online post on the organization’s website.    The passage of the bill comes two weeks after a U.S. appeals court heard arguments over whether a high school in Virginia should be ordered to allow a transgender student to use the boys’ bathroom, even though he was born a biological female. In December, a suburban Chicago school district reached an accord with the U.S. government over locker room access for a transgender student after the U.S. Department of Education’s Office of Civil Rights found the district discriminated against the student.

In those few moments the Senate will go into what s known as an  intersession recess,  creating one golden moment when the president could test his recess-appointment powers by sending Judge Garland to the high court.A smattering of activists has asked him to give it a try, but Mr. Obama has given no indication that he s thinking about it. The White House didn t respond to a request for comment for this story.The move would be a legal gamble under the high court s last ruling in 2014 on recess appointments. That 9-0 decision overturned a handful of Mr. Obama s early 2012 picks, saying the Senate was actually in session when the president acted, so he couldn t use his powers.That ruling also said, however, that there s a difference between appointments made during the annual yearlong session of Congress, dubbed  intrasession,  which Mr. Obama used in 2012, and picks made at the end of the year, after Congress adjourns, which are known as  intersession. William G. Ross, a law professor at Samford University in Birmingham, Alabama, said Mr. Obama would have the power to elevate Judge Garland. But he said it would be  politically unwise and damaging to the prestige of the court. The consensus, though, is that Mr. Obama would be making a mistake to test it that theory. I think it s fair to use the word stretch. I don t know why he would try this. It would backfire,  said Louis Fisher, a scholar in residence at the Constitution Project who served for decades as Congress  top expert on separation-of-powers issues.He said Mr. Obama s 9-0 loss in the 2014 case should still be stinging someone who earned his law degree from Harvard University and taught constitutional law at the University of Chicago. Does he want to go down that road again?  Mr. Fisher said. Perhaps most problematic for Mr. Obama is that recess appointments have a shelf life. Even if he succeeds in putting Judge Garland on the bench, the appointment would expire at the close of 2017   and could end even earlier if the Senate confirms a full-fledged replacement named by Mr. Trump.Worse yet for Mr. Obama, Judge Garland would lose his seat on the U.S. Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit   oftentimes dubbed the second-most powerful court in the country. That means the president would be trading a lifetime of Judge Garland for less than a year of Justice Garland. Since Garland could serve only a year, he presumably would accomplish little and his service would be clouded by the strange and controversial circumstances of his appointment,  said Mr. Ross, the law professor.For entire story  Washington Times',\n",

       " 'The Democrats didn t waste any time pushing for more funding for Amtrak after the Philly crash but anyone with half a brain knows you shouldn t trust this push for more and bigger government funding. Here are some facts, yes, real facts to spread around to your liberal friends so they ll zip it on demonizing the Republicans with lies and distortions The Tuesday night Amtrak derailment in Philadelphia that left eight dead and hundreds injured occurred when a train hit a curve at twice the 50 mile per hour speed limit. So, naturally, this tragedy has devolved into a political rumpus over infrastructure spending.This reflexive demand for more public  investment  could benefit from a fact or two. House Republicans are supposedly to blame (retroactively?) for the crash because the Appropriations Committee passed a transportation funding measure Wednesday that hands Amtrak $289 million for operations and $850 million in capital grants or about $260 million less than its normal annual take.Never mind that Amtrak has pumped $2.6 billion into the 456-mile track called the northeast corridor over the last decade. The eight states along this route that connects Boston to Washington through New York and Philadelphia supplied another $2.4 billion, plus a one-time $1 billion fillip from the 2009 stimulus. Liberals have also discovered a signaling technology called positive train control (PTC) that might have slowed down the train, and they claim Amtrak delayed installation for lack of funding. But Amtrak s inspector general reported as far back as 2012 that the rollout was dogged by poor internal planning, budget overruns and unreliable engineering, adding that  Amtrak has not included total funding for PTC in its financial plan or congressional funding requests. The House bill tries to control costs and reform Amtrak mismanagement, such as its above-market union salaries and benefits (49% of 2014 expenses) and its wasteful food and beverage service. But this modest effort doesn t reach the core problem, which is the political misallocation of  investment. Since Richard Nixon nationalized passenger rail in 1971, Amtrak has been hostage to Congress and has run deficits every year. The feds own all the preferred stock and pretend to require Amtrak to operate as a for-profit corporation. In reality, it must behave as a public utility and social charity.In a 2014 audit, the Amtrak IG observed that management thought  so many legislatively mandated tasks and responsibilities had accumulated over time that it was unclear what to focus on. That view was evident in the company s 2011 strategic plan, which had five strategic themes, seven strategies, numerous initiatives and dozens of performance measures. This hyper-politicization has intensified under President Obama, for whom Euro-style high-speed rail is a special fixation. Ryan Lizza reported in the New Yorker that Mr. Obama  was aggravated when he was told that none of the money from the stimulus would be spent on a signature project, a modern-day Hoover Dam or Interstate Highway System.  So we are getting the $68 billion California bullet train that few will ever ride when it opens in 2028.Despite $3.2 billion in revenue in 2014, a good year, Amtrak required $227 million from taxpayers or 7% of its operating budget. After depreciation and other expenses, it reported a net loss of $1.1 billion. But this disguises the one route where passenger rail is economically rational: the northeast corridor. Amtrak earned $496.7 million on that discrete service in 2014 on strong ridership, up from $390.1 million the prior year. But most of this surplus is used to cross-subsidize unprofitable regional and long-distance service everywhere else.The transfer supports overstaffed, unpopular routes that serve 523 stations in 46 states like the Zephyr, from Chicago to Emeryville, California, or the Empire Builder, from Milwaukee to Seattle. Refusing to stop these lines makes little sense, except for politics. In 2012, the latest year for which data are available, the Transportation Department reports that Amtrak fares averaged 34 cents per mile, versus 15 cents for domestic flights and about a quarter for cars.There are 987 residents for every square mile along the northeast corridor and only 98 on average in the rest of the country. The population density, high traffic and business centers of the northeast are uniquely suited for rail. To the extent northeast rail could gain from capital investment, the cities along the line which produce one of five dollars of U.S. GDP are rich enough to finance their own transportation on the user-pays principle, especially as ticket sales rise.*** The political class refuses to use the word infrastructure unless preceded by  crumbling,  but the truth is that current funding is poorly targeted and Congress won t set priorities. Spinning off the northeast corridor from Amtrak, for example, to build a dedicated high-speed track that bypasses freight and commuter rail might be a viable idea.Instead,  infrastructure  money too often flows to bike paths, nature trails and trolley cars. Every dollar spent connecting Merced to Bakersfield by rail is one that can t be used to replace the Baltimore & Potomac tunnel in Maryland, built in 1873.What any of this has to do with the Philadelphia disaster, who knows. Taxpayers intuitively understand that government has long contributed to public goods, from canals to the Internet. But they would be more willing to finance urgent highway, rail, bridge and airport projects if they had any reason to believe the money would be well spent.Via: WSJ',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump is absolutely obsessed with erasing President Obama s achievements and taking credit for them.In yet another Twitter tantrum on Monday morning, Trump began by whining about the Affordable Care Act.If ObamaCare is hurting people, & it is, why shouldn t it hurt the insurance companies & why should Congress not be paying what public pays?  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2017As usual, Trump is lying his ass off.The truth is that members of Congress must buy health insurance through the exchanges like the rest of us and they don t get a special subsidy either. They pay what the rest of us do.According to FactCheck.org,  lawmakers and their staffs face additional requirements that other Americans don t,  and the  subsidy  which Trump appears to be referring to is just a contribution from the federal government. Lawmakers are merely getting a contribution from their employer like ordinary Americans who get insurance through their employer. Except lawmakers are not getting insurance through their employer like they used to. Members of Congress used to get their healthcare paid for by the taxpayer. That ended under Obamacare as lawmakers were forced to buy a private plan through the exchanges like everyone else. In other words, Congress pays what we pay.And then Trump once again took credit for President Obama s economy.Highest Stock Market EVER, best economic numbers in years, unemployment lowest in 17 years, wages raising, border secure, S.C.: No WH chaos!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) July 31, 2017By the end of President Obama s tenure, and long before Trump was elected, the stock market had already reached record highs. Unemployment fell to under 5 percent thanks to Obama s record 75 consecutive months of job growth. Wages also rose by 2.9 percent. Wages under Trump have actually remained flat no matter how much he wants to take credit for imaginary wage hikes. The border was also secure under Obama as illegal immigration dropped significantly under his watch. And if Trump really thinks his White House isn t chaotic he is truly delusional.The bottom line is that Trump is trying to take credit for things President Obama did while trying to erase his legacy. Trump won t have a legacy, so he is trying to steal Obama s for himself.

       " 'BANGKOK (Reuters) - A roadside bomb planted by suspected Muslim insurgents killed four army rangers and wounded six, including a civilian, in southern Thailand on Friday, a security official said.  A decades old-separatist insurgency in predominantly Buddhist Thailand s largely Muslim provinces of Yala, Pattani, and Narathiwat has killed more than 6,500 people since 2004.  The bomb was planted under a road that was being built in Pattani, the security official said.  The group that planted the bomb is using old techniques in order to create instability in the region. They planted the bomb under a road currently under construction,  said Pramote Prom-in, a spokesman for security forces in the region. Friday s blast followed roadside bombs last week that killed two soldiers and wounded more than 20 people in Yala. There was no claim of responsibility for the blast, which is usually the case in Thailand s deep south, where insurgents are fighting for secession. Thailand s three southernmost provinces were part of an independent Malay Muslim sultanate until they were annexed in 1909. ',\n",

       " ' Patrick Henningsen 21st Century WireThis week another toxic revelation dripped from the Chilcot Report.According to top British SAS officers, US commander Stanley McChrystal s counter-insurgency  black-ops  featured a program of relentless violence designed to  speed up  the process of political cleansing and the so-called  reconstruction  of Iraq.What is so interesting here, is the Chilcot s choice of language, including the term  Latin American-style death squads , which by default implies the United States government was party to war crimes in Central America during the 1980 s   a claim which has always been strenuously denied in public, even though the general public and academia recognizes this to be a self-evident fact of America s long-running ugly history of intervention in that region.The Independent report reveals the level of sheer depravity by US command: The mission was an extraordinary set-up: inside the command centre    The Machine    was the  Death Star , on the walls of which were banks of television screens,  Kill TV , running live pictures of action taking place and surveillance footage in real time from which suspects could be picked out for future arrest or elimination. The Independent also detailed how reckless and violent practices by the US military caused noticeable divisions and splits between joint US-UK command structures and operations, including political tension between British military command.Through the newly created  Office of Special Plans , neoconservatives Paul Wolfowitz and Douglas Feith rolled out their own sub-layer to the US controlled shadow government in Iraq, including the establishment of the  Iraqi De Baathification Council  which, under the supervision of then US Viceroy Paul Bremer, began dismantling the Iraqi military, security and intelligence agency infrastructures of President Saddam Hussein. And so began the process of the Pentagon s  de-Baathification  process in Iraq, immediately followed by a hive of violent  Gangs and Counter-gangs  created by the US and UK covert military and intelligence apparatuses. Front and center in this effort were US operatives John Negroponte and his understudy at the time, Robert Ford, who was later dispatched as US Ambassador to Syria in the run-up to the Syrian Conflict which began in 2011.The legacy of this destructive policy still lingers in Iraq and now in Syria. This unquestionably spawned ISIS and many other terrorist factions in both Iraq and Syria. Only last week, Iraq saw its most deadly car bomb ever, a questionable  sectarian attack  (a narrative not challenged by the western and international press) which killed 200 innocent civilians, and injured many more. GLADIO REDUX: A map of every car bomb in Baghdad since the US-UK invasion in 2003 (Source: Twitter)Prof Michel Chossudovsky explains this same highly disturbing pattern that generally follows every US intervention overseas, be it overt or covert: The recruitment of death squads is part of a well established US military-intelligence agenda. There is a long and gruesome US history of covert funding and support of  terror brigades and targeted assassinations going back to the Vietnam war.   As government forces continue to confront the self-proclaimed  Free Syrian Army  (FSA),  the historical roots of  the West s covert war on Syria  which has resulted in countless atrocities  must be fully revealed.  Once again, we can see the revelation of the US-UK method of not simply instigating wars, but facilitating dirty wars not only overseas, but also at home, as in the case of Operation GLADIO and numerous other false flag events admittedly staged in North America.As 21WIRE will demonstrate in subsequent reports, this latest Chilcot revelation is only the tip of a much larger, covert iceberg RTHowever, kill or capture operations in and around Baghdad, launched from the Balad base 50 miles (80km) north of the city, were a key if little known chapter in Britain s shadow war, the Independent reports.Despite killing or taking as prisoner up to 3,500 insurgents, the mission against the Sunni insurgency caused deep rifts to the point where a senior commander, himself ex-SAS, demanded to know why the UK Special Forces were  helping to run Latin American-style death squads? The mission, under now-famed US General Stanley McChrystal, involved a shift from searching for apparently non-existent weapons of mass destruction (WMD) to man-hunting.Antagonism over the tactics led to UK troops being banned from some operations and a UK SAS commander lodging a complaint with US authorities for talking about British involvement in operations. Another SAS colonel was also ostracized from his regiment after serving under McCrystal.Chilcot does sketch out some of the details of the growing rift, though his report appears to leave out direct references to Special Forces operations. US and UK strategies had, in effect, been on different courses since the UK decision to focus its attention on MND (SE) [Multi-National Division South East, the British run zone] in 2003.As result of this decision, the UK had acquired distinctly different priorities from the US,  the 2.6-million-word report argues.It says the UK was then only  marginally involved in the central tasks of stabilizing the Iraqi government in Baghdad and managing sectarian divisions, while it had come to see its main task in Basra as one of keeping the situation calm while building the case for withdrawal. From that point on, it appears, the US became increasingly concerned that a wavering UK was chiefly focused on getting out of the unpopular war in the best order it could and as soon as possible.In 2006, a former SAS soldier blew the whistle on some of the tactics used in and around Baghdad. Ben Griffin was later gagged by the UK courts for talking about his experiences, but before he was silenced told the Telegraph,  The Americans had this catch-all approach to lifting suspects. The tactics were draconian and completely ineffective. The Americans were doing things like chucking farmers into Abu Ghraib [the notorious prison in Baghdad where US troops abused and tortured Iraqi detainees] or handing them over to the Iraqi authorities, knowing full well they were going to be tortured,  he said at the time.It may be of note that the SAS commander s reference to  Latin American-style deaths squads  appears to ignore the fact that at time of the Iraq war, in July 2003, the UK was itself stepping up training of Colombian paramilitary forces.Commenting on the revelations at the time, human rights NGO Amnesty International warned  the Colombian government has not implemented the UN human rights recommendations and military assistance only gives a green light to the army to carry on as before.

He s ignited a passion for the political process not seen in generations. One of his gifts has been his ability to explain the major issues America is facing today and to offer actual solutions to problems. His straight talk has been refreshing in a political process that borders on the repulsive this election year, especially when it comes to GOP candidates, who often attack each other rather than the issues, making a mockery of the Republican Party and setting a bad example for America. Bernie s straight talk is summed up in a new song called Bernie, Bernie, Bernie, a rallying call for Bernie s supporters to continue the march toward the Democratic nomination.The lyrics in the song include the following: He s come to save democracy from the greed of the plutocracy and slay the phony narrative and make healthcare an imperative. About income inequality and media frivolity, they ll tell you you re just out of luck, while Bernie fights for 15 bucks. Perhaps the most attractive aspect about Bernie Sanders  candidacy is his ability to take stances on issues. Unlike most politicians, the senator actually has views on issues and offers solutions rather than what most politicians do, which is to avoid taking a stance for fear of losing votes.Whether Bernie Sanders is able to win the Democratic nomination or not, he s already changed America. For example, he taught other politicians that if you criticize Israel for its abhorrent treatment of the Palestinians,  you ll survive as a politician, despite the seditious influence that Israel lobby groups have over the American political system. Politicians will have to listen to voters who call for universal healthcare and an America first attitude and Bernie Sanders has been able to normalize this talk.The Bernie Sanders revolution is here.Watch the video here:[youtube https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=w5a2NAfsC4I]Featured image via video screenshot.',\n",
       " 'DAKAR (Reuters) - Congolese security officials recruited more than 200 exiled rebel fighters to help suppress protests against President Joseph Kabila a year ago, ordering them to use lethal force, Human Rights Watch said in a report on Monday. Security forces killed dozens during demonstrations in December 2016 when a delay to presidential elections and Kabila s refusal to step down sparked widespread unrest.  Kabila was required by the constitution to step down after an election to replace him in 2016 but the vote has been delayed until December 2018. Opposition leaders and activist groups have vowed fresh protests this month to try to force him from power. The HRW report was based on interviews with 13 fighters from the M23 rebel group who it says were recruited in neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, M23 leaders and nine Congolese security and intelligence officials, most of whom were cited anonymously.  Congo s government spokesman declined to comment. Delphin Kahimbi, the head of Congo s military intelligence named in the report as one of the operation s coordinators, denied he recruited M23 fighters, calling the report s findings  ridiculous and absurd . M23 president Bertrand Bisimwa said in a statement on Monday that Congo had recruited deserters and others previously kicked out of the group but that M23 leadership was in no way involved. The M23 rose up against the government in eastern Congo in 2012 in one of a series of insurrections driven by disputes over ethnicity, land and resource rights that have cost millions of lives over the past two decades. The M23 was defeated by Congolese and U.N. troops in late 2013. The government subsequently promised amnesty for most of the hundreds of rebels who fled to neighboring Rwanda and Uganda, but the process has stalled. Congo s security services turned to M23 last year because Kabila did not trust his own security forces, the report said. Fighters were deployed to Kinshasa, Congo s second city Lubumbashi and the eastern city of Goma, integrated into police, army and presidential guard units. They were ordered to use lethal force against protesters, the report said. For their service, M23 members received hundreds of dollars each. Recruiters also warned they would lose all protection if Kabila left power. Richard Karemire, Uganda s military spokesman, denied M23 fighters were recruited in Uganda.

I think Newt is lobbying to be the vice president, and I think their people are paying a lot of attention to him,  Ed Rollins told the National Review on Monday.  It d be a ticket with six former wives, kind of like a Henry VIII thing. They certainly understand women. Wow. Just wow.Republicans are facing an unprecedented opposition from female voters and their solution to fix that is to double down on the whole  let s nominate someone who disrespects women  idea.Donald Trump is on wife number three. And given his history, you can bank on him eventually seeking wife number four when Melania is no longer  a 10  in his eyes.He cheated on his first wife with the woman who became his second wife and was quick to start a relationship with the third Mrs. Trump during the separation.And that relationship history is probably why Trump is so keen to count Gingrich as one of his top allies.Let s not forget that Newt Gingrich also cheated on his first wife with his second wife and callously asked for a divorce while she was recovering from cancer surgery in the hospital. Then he cheated on his second wife with the woman who would become his current wife. In 1993, Gingrich began an affair with House of Representatives staffer Callista Bisek and divorced his second wife after she refused to grant him the open marriage he wanted. Keep in mind, this hypocrisy unfolded as Gingrich and Republicans sought to impeach President Bill Clinton for his affair with Monica Lewinsky.And so, Trump has included Gingrich on his short list of vice-presidential candidates and some Republicans are thrilled because they think their six marriages make them experts when it comes to women and that they ll somehow be able to make women flock to their campaign.Frankly, it s insulting.If Republicans really think this is their best strategy to persuade women to vote for the GOP in November they truly never understood women at all. Just the idea that being like Henry VIII, who had two of his wives executed, would make them somehow more appealing to women demonstrates perfectly just how terribly Republicans have treated women. They literally think emulating a womanizing 16th century English king is the best way to deal with women in the 21st century. If anything can make MORE women hate Trump and the GOP, this is it.Featured Image: Wikimedia ',\n",
       " 'Trump supporters are racist and violent. That means that a Donald Trump rally is a very scary and dangerous place for a black woman to be. That didn t stop one black woman from braving the hostility and making sure her voice was heard, though.

The victim said of her harrowing experience at the Trump rally: I was called a n****r and a c*nt and got kicked out. They were pushing and shoving at me, cursing at me, yelling at me, called me every name in the book. They re disgusting and dangerous. One of the Trump-supporting attackers was allegedly identified as known white supremacist and Traditionalist Worker Party leader Matthew Heimbach.

       " 'Republican racists in North Carolina just got their asses handed to them by the United States 4th Circuit Court of Appeals.In 2013, Republicans abused their power in North Carolina by passing a law designed to keep them in power by suppressing the votes of minorities and young people by requiring they bring voter identification. The law also cut early voting, ended same day registration, and heavily restricted pre-registration of young voters. It has been the most draconian anti-voting law in the country, and has drawn massive protests ever since.Critics of the law challenged it s constitutionality in court, only to see the district court rule against them. But now a federal appeals court has not only reversed the lower court s decision, it slammed them. In holding that the legislature did not enact the challenged provisions with discriminatory intent, the court seems to have missed the forest in carefully surveying the many trees,  Judge Diana Motz wrote in the decision.  This failure of perspective led the court to ignore critical facts bearing on legislative intent, including the inextricable link between race and politics in North Carolina. And then Motz roundly condemned the Republican-dominated state legislature of North Carolina. The General Assembly enacted legislation that restricted voting and registration in five different ways, all of which disproportionately affected African Americans,  she wrote, stressing that the court did their homework which led to their ruling.In response to claims that intentional racial discrimination animated its action, the State offered only meager justifications. Although the new provisions target African Americans with almost surgical precision, they constitute inapt remedies for the problems assertedly justifying them and, in fact, impose cures for problems that did not exist. Thus the asserted justifications cannot and do not conceal the State s true motivation.Faced with this record, we can only conclude that the North Carolina General Assembly enacted the challenged provisions of the law with discriminatory intent. Accordingly, we reverse the judgment of the district court to the contrary and remand with instructions to enjoin the challenged provisions of the law. We recognize that elections have consequences, but winning an election does not empower anyone in any party to engage in purposeful racial discrimination.  Motz concluded.Here s the full decision via Talking Points Memo:This is a major victory for voting rights in this country and a humiliating defeat for Republicans who really thought they could suppress the votes of millions of Americans and get away with it just because they gained power in the state.Now Democrats have a fair chance to not only oust these Republicans and take back the state government of North Carolina, the voters who just got their voting rights restored will get a chance to vote in November just in time to participate in what will be a historical election.Featured Image: Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - A trip to Beijing last week by Zimbabwe s military chief was a  normal military exchange , China s Foreign Ministry said on Wednesday, after the military in the southern African nation seized power. Zimbabwe s military took control targeting  criminals  around President Robert Mugabe but gave assurances on national television that the 93-year-old leader and his family were  safe and sound . General Constantino Chiwenga met Chinese Defence Minister Chang Wanquan in Beijing on Friday, where Chang expressed a willingness to promote relations with Zimbabwe, China s Defence Ministry said in a short statement last week. The ministry showed a picture of the two men, both wearing military uniform, shaking hands, and another one of officers from both countries sitting opposite each other holding a meeting at the People s Liberation Army headquarters in Beijing. Asked whether Chiwenga had briefed China on plans to seize power, Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said the Defence Ministry had already released information about his trip and that he didn t have an understanding about the specifics of his reception in China.  I can only tell you that his visit to China this time was a normal military exchange mutually agreed upon by China and Zimbabwe,  Geng said, referring other questions to the Defence Ministry, which has yet to respond to a request for comment.  As a country that is friendly with Zimbabwe, we are paying close attention to developments of the situation in Zimbabwe,  Geng added.   Maintaining peaceful and stable development accords with the fundamental interests of Zimbabwe and regional countries, and is the common desire of the international community. We hope the relevant parties in Zimbabwe appropriately handle their internal matters.  In contrast to his elevated status on the continent, Mugabe is reviled in the West as a despot whose disastrous handling of the economy and willingness to resort to violence to maintain power destroyed one of Africa s most promising states. China and Zimbabwe have a close diplomatic and economic relationship and Beijing has stood with Mugabe s government in the face of Western economic sanctions. In August, Zimbabwe s government said a Chinese company planned to invest up to $2 billion to revive operations at Zimbabwe Iron and Steel Company (ZISCO), which ceased production in 2008 at the height of Zimbabwe s economic meltdown. That same year, China vetoed a proposed Western-backed U.N. resolution which would have imposed an arms embargo on Zimbabwe and financial and travel restrictions on Mugabe and 13 other officials, saying it would  complicate , rather than ease, conflict.

       " 'Let s just put it this way, if world leaders really agree with Donald Trump they have a lot of explaining to do in their home countries.Because a massive global survey found that only TWO nations think Trump is doing a good job.During his speech to the United Nations General Assembly this week, Trump voiced his disdain for the United Nations, accusing the organization of being a mismanaged bureaucracy and threatened to pull American financial and military support.Trump also threatened war with North Korea and criticized the Iran nuclear deal while one of his top advisers told climate ministers that Trump is still withdrawing America from the historic Paris climate agreement.Afterwards, Trump took to Twitter to boast about his speech, and claimed that those in attendance agreed with most or all of what he said.A great and important day at the United Nations.Met with leaders of many nations who agree with much (or all) of what I stated in my speech!  Donald J. Trump (@realDonaldTrump) September 20, 2017In fact, Trump received tepid clapping from the General Assembly, not even close to the kind of thunderous applause President Obama received when he spoke before the international peace-keeping body.And a new study of global surveys reveals that most nations in the world have very little confidence in Trump, which means all the world diplomats who supposedly agree with  much or all  of what Trump said can expect to be replaced. In fact, the only nations who have a favorable view of Trump are Russia and Israel.According to FiveThirtyEight.com, Since Trump took office, confidence in the president has gone down further, on average, than favorability toward the U.S.: Confidence dropped 47 points; U.S. favorability just 13 points Some of the biggest declines have been in countries with whom the U.S. has a collective defense agreement, such as NATO members and Japan, especially when it comes to confidence in the president Mexico, unsurprisingly, also saw a big public opinion drop on both questions. On the other hand, public favorability toward the U.S. has gone up in Russia, and public confidence in the president has gone up in both Israel and Russia since Trump took office. While President Obama enjoyed a public confidence rating of 63 to 73 percent, Trump only has a rating of 27 percent.One of the largest drops came from South Korea, in which only 17 percent have confidence in Trump. 88 percent had confidence in President Obama just two years ago. Clearly, South Koreans are alarmed by the pissing match Trump is having with Kim Jong-Un to discover who is the craziest dictator of them all. Overall, though, Trump has brought a return to George W. Bush-era levels of favorability for the U.S. and the presidency,  FiveThirtyEight concluded.And it turns out that the world disagrees with Trump on most of the issues.Only one nation agreed with Trump s climate change policy. Trump s Mexican border wall was  almost universally disliked.  His vows to withdraw from trade agreements were just as unpopular. Only Turkey approved of withdrawing from the Iran deal. And only three nations approve of Trump s Muslim ban. Basically, most of Trump s supporters come from nations that have committed human rights violations or have oppressive governments.In short, the world representatives who make up the United Nations General Assembly are more likely repulsed by Trump. Tepid clapping is not the definition of overwhelming agreement. Trump thinks that everyone likes him and agrees with him because he is a delusional narcissist.The reality is that Trump has turned America into an international joke and has harmed our reputation around the globe. He is an embarrassment to our country who should be removed from office immediately before he inflicts more damage.He is now the most hated president in history, and that must make George W. Bush very happy. Featured Image: Ron Sachs   Pool/Getty Images',\n",

BAMN is perhaps best known, however, for a 2016 incident in which they showed up to a rally held by the white-nationalist Traditionalist Workers Party outside the California state capitol building in Sacramento. The militant group was confrontational with the white-nationalists within minutes of arrival, and ten people were stabbed and hospitalized in a bloody fight. Police have verified through videos taken by members of the group, news organizations, and bystanders, that BAMN initiated the violence. Falarco was caught on camera at the event repeatedly punching a man in the stomach and throwing him to the ground.Arreguin, a far-left liberal, made headlines in February for his tweets prior to BAMN organizing a riot to prevent right-wing political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking at the city s University of California campus. Using speech to silence marginalized communities and promote bigotry is unacceptable. Hate speech isn t welcome in our community,  Arreguin had tweeted.The mayor also referred to Yiannopoulos as a  white supremacist,  and was forced to issue an  apology. I consider much of what Mr. Yiannopoulos says to be hateful. But I regret and apologize for the white national label,  Arreguin tweeted.Hours after his tweet, supporters of President Donald Trump who hoped to listen to Yiannopoulos speak were under a violent attack. People were assaulted with pipes, a generator-powered spotlight was firebombed, and looters destroyed several businesses in the area including a Starbucks.The rioters smashed windows, spray painted violent messages all over the area   including  Kill Trump    and began committing arsons. It was estimated that the rioters caused $100,000 in damage to the MLK Student Union, and $400,000 to $500,000 in damage to the area surrounding the university.It was immediately alleged that the mayor had ordered the police to stand down and allow the violence and destruction.Arreguin denied the accusations, saying that the police strategy was ordered by the department, not him.

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - An aid convoy arrived at Deir al-Zor in eastern Syria on Thursday, bringing supplies to soldiers and civilians days after the Syrian army broke a three-year Islamic State siege, Syrian state media reported. The Syrian army and its allies reached Deir al-Zor on Tuesday in a sudden advance following months of steady progress east across the desert. The army on Thursday advanced against militants in a pocket they still hold further west, pro-Damascus media reported. State TV broadcast footage of scores of residents cheering with relief in Deir al-Zor as the convoy arrived. The United Nations estimated that 93,000 civilians living under Islamic State siege in Deir al-Zor had been in  extremely difficult  conditions, being supplied only by air drops. The 40 trucks that reached the area on Thursday carried basic needs such as fuel, food and medical supplies to civilians, and included two mobile clinics, state news agency SANA reported. The army also holds another besieged enclave at the city s airbase, separated from its advancing forces by hundreds of meters of IS-held ground. The Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said on Thursday that the army had not yet connected with that enclave, and was working on expanding its corridor from the west. Islamic State mortar fire on neighborhoods still surrounded near the air base killed at least seven civilians and wounded dozens more on Thursday, the British-based monitoring group said. On Thursday, the army also advanced against Islamic State militants in countryside east of the city of Hama, a media unit run by Damascus ally Hezbollah reported.  The advance, which saw forces recapture two villages there, is part of efforts to drive the militants out of an isolated pocket of territory they control east of Hama and Homs. Separately, the U.S. special envoy to the U.S.-led coalition against Islamic State, Brett McGurk, said on Wednesday that a convoy of Islamic State fighters and families from the Syria-Lebanon border was still in open desert. The coalition is using air strikes to block the convoy from reaching IS-held territory in eastern Syria, to which the Syrian army and its ally Hezbollah were escorting it as part of a truce following fighting on the Syria-Lebanon border. Islamic State is fighting separate offensives by both the Syrian army and its allies in eastern and central Syria, as well as the U.S.-backed Syrian Democratic Forces in Raqqa. The group has lost nearly half of its territory across both Iraq and Syria, but still has 6,000-8,000 fighters left in Syria, the United States-led coalition has said. ',\n",
       " 'NAIROBI (Reuters) - Competing efforts to end South Sudan s civil war allow the government to exploit divisions among international brokers and are unlikely to halt the fighting, a confidential U.N. report said.  South Sudan became the world s newest nation when it gained independence from Sudan in 2011. War broke out in late 2013 and has forced more than a quarter of its 12 million population have fled their homes.   The hostilities in South Sudan continue against a complex backdrop of competing regional and bilateral initiatives to resolve the conflict,  U.N. sanctions monitors said in a report to the Security Council seen by Reuters on Friday.   These efforts suffer from several defects, including inadequate oversight, lack of enforcement and the absence of an integrated, coherent plan for peace.   Among the international bodies involved in trying to bring the warring parties to the table are regional bloc IGAD, the U.N. Security Council, a troika of South Sudan s main Western backers prior to independence, and an African Union panel.  The efforts of these groups are affected by  conflicting interests compounded by underlying rivalries in the region , the panel wrote, in what could refer to the role of leaders such as Uganda s Yoweri Museveni, who deployed troops in 2013 to support the Juba government and opposes an arms embargo.  The government of South Sudan has sought to exploit this division  among the competing efforts, the panel said.  Absent a significant shift toward a more coherent and unified approach  from East African nations, coupled with  broader international support for a single and inclusive political process, current efforts are unlikely to ... halt the violence in South Sudan,  it said. Information Minister Michael Makuei Lueth told reporters in Juba:  There is nothing new in this report.  The leaked report is by a panel mandated to document arms flows and security threats. The proliferation of diplomatic efforts has created an opportunity for parties to  forum shop , the panel wrote, saying this bought the armed groups time to organize military operations and avoid attempts to enforce a settlement.      It noted the military was still able to procure weapons while opposition forces  access to arms  remains limited .  The main opposition figure, Riek Machar, is under house arrest in South Africa and has declined to renounce violence. Kiir continues to buy weapons and government forces continue to attack civilians, the report said.   East African leaders said in June they want the warring sides to recommit to the deal they abandoned more than a year ago. In July, Western donors said the process was no longer viable and froze support for it.  There has been no comment in recent months from IGAD or the African Union about a timeline for resumption of peace talks.  This week the United States imposed sanctions on two senior South Sudanese officials and the former army chief. The Security Council last December vetoed the imposition of an arms embargo recommended by the monitors.  ',\n",

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - More than a dozen state prosecutors urged President Donald Trump in a letter on Tuesday not to withdraw from the Paris Climate Agreement, which commits the United States, along with 200 other countries, to reducing its greenhouse gas emissions in an attempt to slow global warming.  With the letter, attorneys general from 12 states as well as the District of Columbia and American Samoa have joined a chorus of voices, including major fossil fuel energy companies as well as environmental advocates, condemning the idea of exiting the agreement, which the Republican president has criticized in the past.  “Climate change, if left unchecked, will lead to global environmental dislocation and disaster on a scale we likely cannot imagine,” the prosecutors wrote, urging the president to “maintain and reconfirm the United States’ commitment to this groundbreaking agreement.” The Paris accord, reached by nearly 200 countries in 2015, seeks to limit global warming by slashing carbon dioxide and other emissions from burning fossil fuels. As part of the deal, the United States committed to reducing its emissions by between 26 percent and 28 percent below 2005 levels by 2025. In an April 14 appearance on television show “Fox & Friends,” Scott Pruitt, a former attorney general for Oklahoma whom Trump appointed to head the U.S. Environmental Protection Agency, called for an “exit” from the Paris Accord while Energy Secretary Rick Perry, speaking at the Bloomberg New Energy Finance conference in New York on Tuesday, said Washington should “renegotiate it.”  Pruitt and Perry were among the administration officials scheduled to meet last week to discuss the U.S. position on the accord, but the meeting was canceled. Sources told Reuters on April 5 a group of coal producers told White House officials that remaining in the global deal to combat climate change would give U.S. negotiators a chance to advocate for coal in the future of the global energy mix. Tuesday’s letter was signed by top prosecutors from Connecticut, Delaware, Iowa, Maine, Maryland, Massachusetts, Minnesota, New York, North Carolina, Oregon, Rhode Island and Vermont.  ',\n",
       " 'CHISINAU (Reuters) - The Moldovan government said on Thursday it has sent 57 servicemen to Ukraine to participate in military exercises starting this week, deepening a row with the pro-Russian president who had vetoed the move.  The drills in western Ukraine from Sept. 8-23 will be conducted mainly by NATO member countries, including the United States, the United Kingdom and Turkey.  They coincide with war games known as  Zapad , or  West , by thousands of Russian troops in Belarus, the Baltic Sea, western Russia and the Russian exclave of Kaliningrad. The Russian exercises have worried NATO despite Moscow s assurances troops would rehearse a purely defensive scenario.    Moldova is governed by a pro-Western government and a pro-Moscow president, meaning frequent clashes over foreign policy, especially where relations with Russia and the European Union are concerned.  The government s plans to send troops were vetoed by President Igor Dodon, who argued that Moldova is bound by its constitution to stay neutral. The defense ministry ignored the president, who is also Moldova s commander-in-chief.  Officially I confirm that, despite all the obstacles, 57 servicemen of Moldova, as was planned earlier, just an hour ago went by bus to participate in NATO military exercises, which start on Friday in Ukraine,  Defence Ministry spokeswoman Diana Gradinaru said.  Earlier this year Dodon banned the participation of military personnel in NATO exercises in Romania, prompting complaints by the U.S. and Romanian ambassadors. Moldova has been governed by pro-Western governments since 2009 and signed a trade pact with the EU in 2014. Russia retaliated by halting imports of Moldovan farm produce, depriving the country of a key market for its wine, fruit and vegetables. Relations suffered further this year due to a dispute in March over the treatment of Moldovan officials traveling to or through Russia, and the expulsion of Russian diplomats in May. In August, Moldova declared Russian Deputy Prime Minister Dmitry Rogozin persona non grata, accusing him of making defamatory remarks about Moldovan government officials.  ',\n",

       " 'With the White House plagued with scandals, Donald Trump has repeatedly blamed the  dishonest media  for not giving him proper credit after he  inherited a mess  from former President Barack Obama.We have some bad news for Mr. Trump. The world strongly disagrees with him. Trump has been in office for only 168 days and yet he has already had a major impact on how the world sees the United States.MSNBC s Chris Matthews highlighted a new Pew Research Center poll which shows that Trump and many of his key policies are broadly unpopular around the globe, and ratings for the U.S. have declined steeply in many nations.Trump is wildly unpopular worldwide while Obama s popularity soars above the former reality show star s ratings. 37 nations were included in the poll, showing that a median of just 22% has confidence in Trump to do the right thing when it comes to international affairs. In contrast to the final years of Barack Obama s presidency, a median of 64% expressed confidence in Trump s predecessor to direct America s role in the world.Watch: This highlights why Trump has exhibited so much jealousy toward his popular predecessor. Trump will never be respected like Obama was and is. Trump s jealously toward Obama was displayed long before he took the oath of office. Obama would never bash the U.S. media and intelligence agencies while on foreign soil. In fact, he never did that in the U.S., but Trump does and did. Obama retaliated against Russia s meddling in our 2016 presidential election by ordering 35 Russian diplomats to leave the country. Obama imposed sanctions against the foreign hostile government, while Trump s administration would like to lift them.The former reality show star is  fake news  and that can be seen daily in his Twitter timeline but he is good at projection.By the way, Trump is not expected to confront Russian leader Vladimir Putin today at the G20 summit meeting about his country s interference in our presidential election.Photo by Joe Raedle/Getty Images.',\n",

       " 'No need to file rules don t apply to Obama s amnestied illegals Illegal immigrants granted executive amnesty can claim back tax credits for work they performed illegally, even if they never filed a tax return during those years, IRS Commissioner John Koskinen has confirmed to Sen. Chuck Grassley (R-IA).In a written response to questions Grassley, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee, asked Koskinen following a February hearing on the IRS budget, the IRS commissioner clarified his earlier assertions that illegal immigrants granted executive amnesty   and Social Security numbers   can access Earned Income Tax Credits (EITC) for years they were working in the country illegally.Back in February, Koskinen said that in order to claim the tax credits the amnestied illegal immigrant would have had to have filed returns in the past.In his written statement to Grassley, released Wednesday, Koskinen went another step, saying an illegal immigrant granted amnesty could claim back tax credits regardless if they had filed returns in the past. To clarify my earlier comments on EITC, not only can an individual amend a prior year return to claim EITC, but an individual who did not file a prior year return may file a return and claim EITC (subject to refund limitations under section 6511 of the Internal Revenue Code). I would note that filing new returns for prior years would likely be difficult, since filers would have to reconstruct earnings and other records for years when they were not able to work on the books,  Koskinen said in his written response.According to the IRS, illegal immigrants granted amnesty, and with it Social Security numbers, can claim up to three years prior in back tax credits. Section 32 of the Internal Revenue Code requires an SSN on the return, but a taxpayer claiming the EITC is not required to have an SSN before the close of the year for which the EITC is claimed. At your request, the IRS has reviewed the relevant statutes and legislative history, and we believe that the 2000 Chief Counsel Advice (CCA) on this issue is correct,  Koskinen added.With this benefit Illegal immigrants granted amnesty could receive tens of thousands of dollars in back tax refunds.Via: Breitbart News',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Former U.S. President Bill Clinton on Wednesday called running his family’s charitable foundation one of the great honors of his life in a passionate defense against criticism of its work as his wife, Hillary Clinton, campaigns to become president. Speaking onstage in a New York City hotel ballroom for about an hour, he told supporters of the Bill, Hillary & Chelsea Clinton Foundation that it had brought about “a profound advance in the conduct and impact of modern philanthropy.”  “Don’t give up what brought you here,” he said, closing out the 12th and final annual conference organized by the foundation, called the Clinton Global Initiative. “You have done something good and noble and worthy.” The foundation, which Clinton founded as he prepared to leave the White House in 2001, has come under intense scrutiny brought about by a long presidential campaign.  Journalists have scoured newly released email records from Hillary Clinton’s tenure running the State Department from 2009 to 2013, which show foundation officials seeking meetings with Clinton or other diplomats on behalf of donors.  Donald Trump, Clinton’s Republican opponent for the presidency, has called for a special prosecutor to investigate allegations of breaching government ethics rules. The Clintons have said that even if some of their wealthiest donors, which include corporations and foreign governments with interests before the U.S. government, may have hoped for special favors in return, none were granted. To avert suggestions of conflicts of interest, the foundation has said it will drastically limit its operations if Hillary Clinton, the Democratic Party’s presidential candidate, wins the election to succeed Barack Obama on Nov. 8.  It would stop accepting money from foreign and corporate donors, foundation officials say, and much of its work would be spun off into independent entities not controlled by the Clintons. Bill Clinton, 70, has expressed frustration that political journalists covering his wife’s campaign have written more about the foundation’s donors, which include the government of Saudi Arabia and foreign billionaires, than the charitable programs it runs.  He spoke at length about how he had been moved by meeting children with HIV in Cambodia, orphans left behind by the 2004 tsunami that struck Indonesia and victims of the earthquake in Haiti in 2010. He made only oblique references to the 2016 election campaign. “Everywhere today there is a temptation to say that everything I just told you is wrong, ‘Life is a zero-sum game and I’m losing; no, you’re wrong, our differences matter more than our common humanity,’” he said. “These are not the right choices.” (Refiles to make clear in paragraph 5 that foundation officials were seeking the meetings on behalf of donors.)

       " 'TOKYO (Reuters) - Japan s coast guard on Thursday boarded a North Korean fishing boat near a Japanese island where the crew said they had taken shelter from rough seas, the latest in a series of North Korean vessels in distress drifting into Japanese waters. The wooden boat was towed nearer the northern island of Hokkaido for inspection, a coast guard spokesman said. Authorities had yet to decide what to do with the vessel and the ten fishermen on board.  At this point, it is still too early to say what we will do,  he said. Experts say food shortages may be driving fishermen to risk taking their small boats to more dangerous waters closer to Japan. The encounters have attracted greater attention amid tension in the region over North Korea s weapons programs and its latest missile test on Wednesday. There has been no suggestion that the fishermen may be defectors from the impoverished, tightly controlled country which has fired two missiles over Japan in recent tests and regularly threatens to destroy the United States. On Monday, eight bodies believed to be of North Koreans, which had been partly reduced to skeletons, were found in a small wooden ship washed up on a beach on Japan s northwest coast. Two other bodies were found at the weekend on the western shore of the Sea of Japan island of Sado, with life jackets displaying Korean lettering.  Last week, police in northern Japan found eight North Korean men who said they landed after claiming their vessel had lost power and run into trouble. On Thursday, the coast guard issued an advisory to shipping about a half-sunken wooden boat floating in waters close to Sado. ',\n",
       " 'A Socialists dream!  Now you can check your privilege at the door. With the Equipay app, you ll never have to walk away from a restaurant with friends wondering if you paid your fair share It s a huge dilemma for progressives: on the one hand, it s terribly patriarchal for a man to pay for a woman s dinner. On the other hand, the gender pay gap of feminist mythology holds that women only make 77 cents for every dollar earned by a man. So isn t the failure to pay just another contribution to structural sexism?Equipay, a new app for Android and the iPhone has a solution. Developed by San Francisco-based  comedian  Luna Malbroux, the app divides bills between dinner guests according to their race and gender. For example, black women, who allegedly make just 64 cents on the dollar compared to white men, would only pay 64 per cent of their share of the bill.According to the app s website,  Equipay helps you avoid the entrenched discrimination that exists in our society. It doesn t split the bill equally it splits it equitably. You pay what you should to balance out the wage gap. The app is free to use   unless you re a member of a  high-privilege group.  Then there s a surcharge. As the site explains:  When dining out with a high privilege group, Equipay automatically adds an EquipayItBack Surcharge. This fee subsidizes meals for others and funds Equipay s charitable arm. Thanks! Last but not least, the app allows users to let their followers know whenever they ve used the app to smash the patriarchy at the dinner table. In a live presentation of the app, Melbroux described how a user,  Graham  shares his Equipay-powered purchase on social media  to show that he is a social justice ally. Of course, having informed the world of his use of Equipay, it remains to be seen if  Graham  will ever be invited out for a meal again.The app won first prize at San Francisco s  Comedy Hack Day,  which brings  comedians, developers, and designers together.  However, Melbroux insists that the app isn t a joke. In an interview with Care2, she expressed hopes that the app would start a serious conversation:  I hope that this, more than anything, starts a discussion and helps people to start thinking a little bit differently about how we can use more technology and more innovation to address inequality and wage inequality. For the rest of us, the app s social media sharing function will give us a useful list of people to never invite out for dinner.  Via:Breitbart',\n",

       " 'FORT MEADE, Md. (Reuters) - The U.S. government should have publicized the existence of a program that vacuumed up in bulk Americans’ telephone call data before its existence was leaked by former contractor Edward Snowden, the National Security Agency’s deputy director said on Tuesday. Richard Ledgett, who is retiring next month, said in an interview with Reuters that disclosing the secret program would have been difficult. But, he said, doing so might have mitigated the damage done by Snowden. “That’s one where I might have to say, yes,” Ledgett said in his office at NSA headquarters in Fort Meade, Maryland. “That’s one where maybe it would have been less shocking when Snowden did what he did.” Ledgett’s comments, which echo the sentiments of some former top U.S. officials, come as the U.S. intelligence community is stepping up efforts to convince Congress to reauthorize other controversial surveillance programs. Those programs allow intelligence agencies to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreigners living overseas, but incidentally scoops up the communications of an unknown number of Americans. The programs, authorized by Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, expire on Dec. 31 unless Congress takes action. Ledgett said that the NSA, whose mission is to intercept adversaries’ communications while protecting sensitive U.S. government networks, had learned from the Snowden experience. “We’re being very open about the (Section 702) program, and will be,” he said. Privacy advocates have repeatedly demanded that the government share an estimate of how many Americans are ensnared by programs authorized under Section 702. Intelligence officials have declined to do so. But Ledgett, in remarks earlier Tuesday at a forum sponsored by the Aspen Institute, said “yes” when asked if an estimate would be provided before year end. Snowden’s revelation of the bulk telephone data program - which captured information about calls such as the numbers and time stamp, but not their actual content - prompted congressional hearings and court battles. In 2015, Congress passed a law replacing it with a more limited system while installing new transparency measures over U.S. surveillance activity.  U.S. officials argued that the program was lawful, and aimed at finding violent militants or other adversaries in communication with allies inside the United States. In the 50-minute interview at the NSA’s large campus outside Washington, Ledgett expressed concern about the vulnerability of U.S. critical infrastructure to cyber attack by another nation. “All of the major cyber threat actors that we worry about have efforts in place, have that capability,” he said. “Can you take out a traffic system? Absolutely. Can you take out comm(unication)s systems? Absolutely. Can you take out gas and oil distribution, and energy distribution systems? Absolutely you can. ... We’re more vulnerable than most.” He also gave a small insight into the secret cyber battles playing out globally, around-the-clock.  In late 2015, he said, an unclassified U.S. government computer network was penetrated by another nation, and the NSA was called in to help. In the past, when an adversary realized they had been discovered, they would withdraw. “Like a turtle, touch them and they pull in their shell,” Ledgett said. “What happened here was, they fought back. So it kind of became a hand-to-hand combat thing,” he said. “We’d remove their malware. They would deploy new malware, even though they knew we were in the system. They were just trying to get around us.” He declined to name the attacker or the computer system involved.    ',\n",

Considering how many cowardly men are walking around with masks over their faces while they grab one person from the free-speech side into their crowd, so the entire group could brutally beat one person with no interference from the other side, it shouldn t surprise anyone that the women are the aggressors.Salads also points out that the Antifa members  aren t too smart.

Salads also confirms Antifa members were throwing rocks, bottles and M-80 s into the crowd.Tim Pool frequently calls the Trump supporters the  alt-right  which according to the left (who made up the term to disparage Trump supporters) means that they are  racists .

The State Department and the DHS can sanction countries that\\xa0do not cooperate with removals, but has only used that punishment authority twice in the past 15 years. The current 12 countries deemed recalcitrant are China, Cuba, Vietnam, Laos, Iran, Cambodia, Myanmar, Morocco, Hong Kong, South Sudan, Guinea and Eritrea. Acting DHS Secretary Elaine Duke sent a letter to the State Department last week identifying the latest four countries that could face the new penalties. DHS spokesman David Lapan declined to discuss possible sanctions or the names of the four countries that could face additional sanctions, including denying visas. However, CNN cited a DHS official close to discussions about the deliberations as saying on Wednesday the four under consideration were Cambodia, Eritrea, Guinea and Sierra Leone. In two cases since 2000, the United States halted issuing visas to government officials and their families to Guinea and Gambia. Lapan said in some cases the DHS has no choice but to release some convicted criminals who served prison time but could not be returned to their home country because their home country refuses to cooperate. “We have tens of thousands of individuals,” Lapan said.\\xa0 The DHS identifies countries that can be sanctioned and the State Department decides what, if any, sanctions could be imposed. The DHS has said that it has final deportation orders against 35,000 Cuban citizens that have criminal histories that Cuba refuses to accept. ',\n",
       " 'The Democrats tried to attach a gun control amendment to the bill, but Republicans blocked those amendments. Of course, Obama says he ll veto the bill. What the majority of Americans want is of no consequence to the King The U.S. Senate approved a bill Thursday that would strip Obamacare of key tax-raising features and would also eliminate taxpayer-funding of abortion businesses, including Planned Parenthood. For years, the American people have been calling on Washington to build a bridge away from Obamacare,  said Senate Majority Leader Sen. Mitch McConnell (R-KY). For years, Democrats prevented the Senate from passing legislation to do so. The 52 to 47 vote also would strip taxpayer funding from Planned Parenthood for one year. This measures has been pushed by a renewed call to defund the abortion business since the release of videos exposing the organization s apparent practices of harvesting body parts of unborn babies and altering the position of babies during abortions in order to harvest their intact organs.Sens. Sen. Ted Cruz (R-TX), Sen. Marco Rubio (R-FL), and Sen. Mike Lee (R-UT)challenged a repeal bill passed by the House for not going far enough. A conservative aide tells Breitbart News that Senate leadership is finally following their lead in keeping their promises to the American people who elected them.The measure, which passed 52-47 under the reconciliation budgetary process, will head to the House for a vote. The House passed a similar Obamacare repeal bill. The Senate and the House must soon approve identical bills before they can get to the president s desk.President Barack Obama, however, has already said he will veto the Senate bill.In the Senate, Democrats and several liberal Republicans tried but failed to gut the language that defunds Planned Parenthood from the bill.Family Research Council president Tony Perkins commended the U.S. Senate for approving the bill.  This is a huge victory for unborn children, their mothers, and for taxpayers,  Perkins said.  For the first time during the Obama presidency, both the U.S. Senate and House of Representatives have approved legislation that begins to end the forced partnership between taxpayers and Planned Parenthood. President Obama will now bear the moral responsibility for sending our tax dollars to a group that has engaged in the selling of baby body parts,  he continued.  Even if the President vetoes the bill, we ve still succeeded, because a Senate precedent has now been set for moving a similar measure forward when America finally has a President who understands the value of every person, born and unborn. Father Frank Pavone, national director of Priests for Life, also praised the Senate s approval of the legislation that would transfer taxpayer Medicaid money from Planned Parenthood to health care clinics that do not perform abortions.  It s an understatement to say that Planned Parenthood has shown itself unworthy of taxpayer support,  said Pavone.  The 325,000 lives it destroys every year are 325,000 reasons to redirect taxpayer funds to groups that provide health care without taking innocent lives. When there are legitimate health care providers that actually help women and their babies, it s a travesty to give one dime to Planned Parenthood,  he added.  The Senate is to be commended for standing up for women, their children, and taxpayers who object to subsidizing a billion-dollar abortion business. The bill would also end the individual mandate of Obamacare that requires most people to purchase health insurance, and strip the authority of the federal government to run health care exchanges.

       " 'Alzheimer s Disease is a devastating type of dementia, accounting for 60 to 80 percent of dementia cases, and currently affecting over 5 million Americans. According to the Alzheimer s Association, it is the 6th leading cause of death in the United States, and someone in the U.S. develops the disease every 66 seconds. By 2050, the number of cases is projected to reach 13.8 million.Scientists and researchers have grappled with understanding the disease in a search for a cure since 1906, when German neurologist Dr. Alois Alzheimer discovered the plaques and tangles in the brain of a woman who had died of an unknown mental illness with symptoms of memory loss, difficulty with language, and erratic behavior. Over the progression of the disease, amyloid plaque deposits and neurofibrillary tangles build up in the brain, disrupting connections between nerve cells and ultimately death of nerve cells and brain tissue.A recent study led by scientists from the University of Glasgow in Scotland and Hong Kong University of Science and Technology has produced a potential breakthrough in Alzheimer s disease treatment.In mice with a progressive disease similar to Alzheimer s, the researchers injected a protein called IL-33. Within a week, the memory and cognitive functions of the affected mice improved to normal levels.  The daily protein injections cleared out existing amyloid plaque in the brain of mice and stopped its development. The results have yet to be tested in humans, with no guarantee the protein will have similar results in human trials. A 2014 study estimated positive results from experiments on mice translate to success in humans at a rate of 8 percent.Nonetheless, the study is promising as no cure or treatment is currently available for Alzheimer s disease. Alzheimer s care and other forms of dementia are estimated to cost the United States $236 billion in 2016.Working with the mice, the Scottish and Chinese researchers found the protein, IL-33, promotes the development of microglia, immune cells in the brain, and direct them towards the plaque formed by Alzheimer s disease. The relevance of this finding to human Alzheimer s is at present unclear. But there are encouraging hints,  said Professor Eddy Liew, a leading researcher of the study from the University of Glasgow, in a press release.  For example, previous genetic studies have shown an association between IL-33 mutations and Alzheimer s disease in European and Chinese populations. Furthermore, the brain of patients with Alzheimer s disease contains less IL-33 than the brain from non-Alzheimer s patients. There have been enough false  breakthroughs  in the medical field to caution us not to hold our breath until rigorous clinical trials have been done. The researchers will soon begin the first phase of clinical trials on humans to test the toxicity of the protein IL-33 at the doses used on mice, with the global medical community anticipating with hope for favorable results.Featured Image Courtesy of Flickr',\n",

Not only was there a completely despicable message on the back of the shirt, but the front makes a disgraceful, tasteless reference to former POTUS Bill Clinton s infamous affair with Monica Lewinsky. There couldn t be a more immature, vile way to disrespect Democratic front runner Hillary Clinton than this.These t-shirts were being sold outside of the event, and it s shameful to think that even one person would buy one. But then again, what else can you expect from someone who believes that Trump is worthy of being the next President of the United States?These people have stood by Trump through every single one of his attacks on women. Not including Trump s extremely long (and forever expanding) history of misogyny, these morons have supported the disgraced candidate through his horrific abortion remarks that stated women should be punished for terminating a pregnancy, his unprovoked attacks on rival Ted Cruz s wife, an incident where Trump s own campaign manager threw a female reporter to the ground (and Trump did NOTHING about it), Trump s one-sided feud with Fox News anchor Megyn Kelly, his awkwardly incestuous comments about his own daughters, and so much more.These people have absolutely NO moral compass between right and wrong, and they ll do anything just to get some attention   just like Trump himself. Trump s misogynistic messages are becoming more and more terrifying, and his followers are going to stand behind him one hundred percent. The GOP has been terrorizing women forever, but Trump s particular brand of hateful rhetoric is especially dangerous. Featured image via Twitter',\n",
       " 'QAMISHLI, Syria (Reuters) - Kurdish-led authorities held local elections on Friday in areas they control in northern Syria, pushing ahead with autonomy plans opposed by both the government of President Bashar al-Assad and by Turkey. Kurdish forces and their political allies now hold the largest part of Syria outside the grip of Assad s government. They have captured vast territory from Islamic State with the support of U.S. arms, jets and ground advisers, although Washington opposes their autonomy drive. Kurdish leaders say their goal is to establish self-rule within Syria, not secession. But their influence has infuriated Ankara, which considers the Kurdish YPG militia to be an offshoot of the banned Kurdistan Workers  Party (PKK) that has run a decades-long insurgency in Turkey. Assad has vowed to recover every inch of the country, as his territorial grip expanded rapidly over the past two years with help from Russia and Iran. Damascus has more forcefully asserted its claim to territory held by Kurdish-led forces in recent months. The head of Syria s delegation to U.N.-backed peace talks in Geneva, Bashar al-Ja afari, rejected the election, repudiating  any unilateral act that happens without coordination  with Damascus.   Since Syria s conflict began more than six years ago, the dominant Kurdish parties have been left out of international diplomacy in line with Turkish wishes. They were excluded again from U.N.-led peace talks which reconvened in Geneva this week.  Hadiya Yousef, a senior Kurdish politician, said the Kurdish-led administration would not be bound by decisions taken in its absence.  We are not present in these meetings, and therefore we are developing the solution on the ground,  Yousef told Reuters. Peace talks would not  arrive at solutions  so long as they do not involve those running 30 percent of the country, she added. Voters are picking from close to 6,000 candidates for town and city councils on Friday, the second part of a three-stage process that will culminate in electing a parliament early next year. They chose representatives for smaller-scale district councils in September.  Everyone should take part (in the election) because this is the fate of the entire region,  said Sheikhmous Qamishlo, a 65-year-old Syrian Kurd at a polling station in Qamishli.  This is a new experience, we wish it success,  he said, and described casting his vote as a  national duty .    The election was being monitored by a small group of politicians from other countries in the Middle East, Yousef said, including a member of the Kurdistan Democratic Party which runs the autonomous Kurdish region in neighboring Iraq. Yousef said the Iraqi Kurdish official s presence was  a kind of recognition  of the Syrian Kurdish political project. The Iraqi Kurdish authorities, whose own plans for independence were met with a swift backlash from states in the region in the past two months, have previously been hostile to the Syrian Kurdish parties.

       " 'By James PerloffMy friend Rachael McIntosh was an alternate delegate at the 2012 Republican Convention in Tampa, Florida, representing Ron Paul for the state of Rhode Island.Rachael had worked for a private defense contractor for years. Awakened by the corruption and darkness she witnessed, she left the defense industry, and began working tirelessly toward getting Ron Paul elected. She has fictionalized her experiences in a superbly written trilogy of novels, Security through Absurdity.The Tampa convention was supposed to begin on Monday, August 27. Ron Paul was originally slated to speak, but the convention was cancelled for that evening due to the threat of a  hurricane.  The hurricane turned out to be no more than a brisk rainstorm. Rachael and many other Ron Paul delegates braved it that morning and went to the convention center (the Tampa Bay Times Forum, a sports complex) to watch Republican National Committee Chairman Reince Priebus officially proclaim the delay. After the gravel had been struck and the chairman left the stage, the delegates found themselves watching a movie glorifying Mitt Romney. At the film s conclusion, Rachael heard ear-splitting applause. But when she looked around, almost no one was cheering. The applause was  canned the type sports stadiums pipe in when the home team is losing and their spectators show low enthusiasm.The next day at her hotel, Rachael s husband called and said:  Hey, I watched it yesterday and the crowd was really diggin  Romney.  Rachael had to break the news: what he (and the rest of America) heard on TV had been faked.The real blow to the Ron Paul people came when the Republican National Committee made last-minute rule changes. Under the existing rules, Paul had won enough primaries and caucuses (five) to have his name placed in nomination. Under the newrules, the required number of states would be increased to eight, thus rendering Paul s nomination impossible. Mitt Romney, who had already won sufficient delegates through dirty tricks during the primaries to become the  presumptive nominee,  would also be granted power to replace duly elected delegates with people of his own choosing.Naturally, Paul s delegates were anxious to vote on the rule changes. However, the convention busses showed up at their hotels late. The driver of Rachael s bus didn t seem to know the way to the convention center, got stuck in traffic, and took about two hours to complete the trip. By the time most of the Paul delegates reached the center, and passed through its heavy security, the vote was already over. Mitt Romney would be the Republican Convention s  unanimous  choice.Ron Paul was still offered a chance to make a speech, but only under two conditions: (1) that he endorse Romney; and (2) that the Republic National Committee first vet and approve the speech. Under these conditions, Paul acted on integrity and declined to speak.A word should be added about the media in Tampa. On the convention s last day, Rachael dressed up in funeral black and handed out cards offering condolences to America upon the loss of the democratic process. She gave one to a leading news journalist who said  I love it.  When Rachael asked if he would do a story on it, he literally replied:  It doesn t fit the pre-scripted narrative. Sorry. That the media was bound to a  pre-scripted narrative  was later proven when a brawl broke out between the Romney and Paul delegates, complete with screaming, pushing and shoving, right by the entrance to the press boxes (CNN, Fox, MSNBC, etc.). Although the brawl should have been  news,  not a single journalist emerged with a camera to record it. After all, it didn t fit the  pre-scripted narrative namely, that Republicans unanimously supported Mitt Romney.What lesson can we draw from Rachael s experience? The same one that people have been learning the hard way for decades: that regardless of much you work for a Presidential candidate, the PTB (Powers That Be) will railroad their candidate to the top. The following quote from my 1988 book The Shadows of Power refers to the election year of 1952:At the Republican nominating convention,  dirty tricks  abounded. The rules for selecting delegates were changed: Taft delegations from Georgia, Louisiana, and Texas were thrown out and replaced by Eisenhower supporters. I.e., the same sort of tactics that Ron Paul s supporters faced in 2012 were used at the GOP Convention 60 years earlier. I ll add that Dwight Eisenhower had no previous affiliation with the Republican Party; the Democratic Party had tried to draft him in 1948, and President Harry Truman (Democrat) had approached him about running on the same ticket. Above: Nixon and Eisenhower at the 1952 conventionLet s kick it back to 1940. Seven weeks before the GOP Convention, a poll showed only three percent of Republicans favored candidate Wendell Willkie, who, prior to that year, had been a registered Democrat. But with powerful magic, Willkie got the nomination. Ten-term Congressman Usher Burdick of North Dakota said of this:We Republicans in the west want to know if Wall Street and the international bankers control our party and can select our candidate? I believe I am serving the best interests of the Republican Party by protesting and exposing the machinations and attempts of J.P. Morgan and the New York utility bankers in forcing Wendell Willkie on the Republican Party. . . .There is nothing to the Willkie boom for President except the artificial public opinion being created by newspapers, magazines, and the radio. The reason back of all this is money. Money is being spent by someone, and lots of it. PHOTO: Wendell Willkie PHOTO: Usher Burdick (right) in 1958 with Ezra PoundFor those who wonder if such phenomena only happen to Republicans, Bernie Sanders can already  feel the spurn.  He won New Hampshire by a landslide (60 to 38 percent) only to discover that Hillary Clinton had been awarded the majority of delegates. This is because the Democratic Party has 717  superdelegates  who support whomever they prefer, regardless of the wishes of voters or primary results.Go back to 1976. According to a Gallup poll, just seven months before the Democratic National Convention, less than four percent of Democratic voters favored Jimmy Carter for President. What happened? As Lawrence Shoup noted in The Carter Presidency and Beyond:What Carter had that his opponents did not was the acceptance and support of elite sectors of the mass communications media. It was their favorable coverage of Carter and his campaign that gave him an edge, propelling him rocket-like to the top of the opinion polls. This helped Carter win key primary election victories, enabling him to rise from an obscure public figure to President-elect in the short space of 9 months.How did Carter acquire this media following? It began at a dinner with Republican David Rockefeller  kingmaker of the Establishment at the latter s Tarrytown, New York estate. Also present was Zbigniew Brzezinski, who helped Rockefeller found the internationalist Trilateral Commission, and whom Carter would later appoint National Security Adviser. The media blitz included adulatory pieces in the New York Times, and a Wall Street Journal editorial declaring that Carter was the best Democratic candidate. Before the nominating convention, his picture appeared on the cover of Time three times, and Newsweek twice. Time s cover artists were even instructed to make him look as much as possible like John F. Kennedy. The TV networks inundated the public with his image.As former Arizona Senator Barry Goldwater said:David Rockefeller and Zbigniew Brzezinski found Jimmy Carter to be their ideal candidate. They helped him win the nomination and the presidency. To accomplish this purpose, they mobilized the money power of the Wall Street bankers, the intellectual influence of the academic community   which is subservient to the wealth of the great tax-free foundations   and the media controllers represented in the membership of the CFR and the Trilateral.If you want to glimpse how far back this sort of power-brokering goes, read Ferdinand Lundberg s 1937 classic America s Sixty Families. He related how, a century ago, the rich were scorning voters and maneuvering their own choices into nominations, whether a Democrat like Woodrow Wilson in 1912 or a Republican like Herbert Hoover in 1928.The 2016 RaceWhat about this year? Who have the  PTB  anointed to become President? While I am of course not privy to their conclaves, I believe their chosen one, as I stated in my blog post of February 15, is Hillary Clinton. There are several indicators:(1) Despite her  anti-Wall Street  rhetoric, Hillary receives by far the most donations from Wall Street of any candidate. Jeb Bush competed with her for that distinction, but since Jeb s personality proved too lackluster to muster enough votes to stay in the race, Hillary holds the honor alone. Above: Hillary partakes in groundbreaking ceremony for Goldman Sachs  new headquarters in 2005. (2) Of the viable candidates, only Hillary is committed to 100 percent of the Rothschild agenda:  pro  War on Terror    pro Israel   pro gun control   pro GMO (Monsanto)   pro population control (abortion, vaccines, etc.)   pro  climate change  control   pro mass immigration   pro Internet censorship   pro gay agenda   pro TPP (she is currently backing off on this because of voter concern about jobs, but before running she said  This TPP sets the gold standard in trade agreements, and was a strong proponent of the job-destroying NAFTA and GATT agreements)(3) I ll interject here that Rachael McIntosh told me she believes that in 2008, an understanding was reached concerning Obama and Clinton, both of whom were running that year. Obama would become the first black President; Hillary s turn would arrive in due time, and she would become the first woman President. Having a black or woman in the Oval Office, of course, gives the public the illusion that they are  empowered  and that the Establishment has somehow been stymied, whereas in fact both Obama and Hillary are flunkies for the Establishment. I agree with Rachael s assessment 100 percent.And so it was that Obama appointed Hillary his Secretary of State, a move clearly intended to give her a  foreign policy expertise  credential for the 2016 Presidential campaign. After Clinton left the position (2013), CBS began airing (2014) its still-running drama Madam Secretary, all about a blonde woman Secretary of State. Subliminal Advertising: Hollywood began campaigning for Hillary Clinton in 2014.  Beginning with the very first episode, in which  Madam Secretary  rescued American hostages held in Syria, viewers would receive a weekly dose of subliminal propaganda for Hillary s campaign, portraying her as beautiful, heroic, honest and competent.(4) Prior to being Secretary of State, Hillary served as U.S. Senator from New York. She had never lived in New York before, but the state is the center of America s banking industry, and has been a launching point for Presidential candidates such as the Roosevelts. Serving a Senate term, of course, would also give Hillary an important  can work with Congress  credential for her Presidential run. There is considerable Internet buzz that John F. Kennedy, Jr., who had long lived in New York, was planning to run for the Senate in 2000, the same year as Clinton. The handsome son of the popular President would likely have defeated Clinton, adding interest to Kennedy s death in a suspicious plane crash on July 16, 1999, especially in light of what has been termed the Clinton Body Count.(5) Perhaps most importantly, the Establishment has already marked Hillary with their stamp of approval by entrusting her with two terms in the White House. Yes, Bill Clinton was President then, but if Hillary is elected, Bill will of course be returning.Will the email or Benghazi scandals derail her Presidential bid? I doubt it. During Bill s tenure, the Clintons were plagued by innumerable scandals besides mysterious deaths: sex charges, perjury, Whitewater,  Chinagate,   Travelgate,  drug allegations connected with his Arkansas governorship, Hillary s incredible cattle futures profits, etc. Yet although many pundits back then claimed these scandals would lead to impeachment, the Clintons always remained untouched by justice. So far, nothing seems to have changed. However, Hillary s scandals do give the Establishment a blackmailer s leash on her; i.e., if she ever steps out of line, prosecutions could suddenly materialize.What about the other candidates currently running? All of them share some of Hillary s positions, but none do 100 percent. Bernie Sanders is too opposed to banker bailouts to be acceptable, even though the Establishment is OK with his socialism (since, in an illusional democracy, empowering government empowers them). Cruz s wife Heidi is a former term member of the Council on Foreign Relations and a vice president at Goldman Sachs, from whom Cruz s Senate campaign received a million-dollar loan; but his positions on matters like abortion, gun control and immigration don t pass muster Continue this story at James PerloffREAD MORE ELECTION NEWS AT: 21st Century Wire 2016 Files',\n",

However, since Donald Trump was inaugurated, that right has been under attack. Trump is a thin-skinned, narcissistic bully who cannot take criticism, and his allies are now doing all they can to discredit anyone who dares to say a word against Trump. Of course, at the top of that list is the National Rifle Association (NRA), the terrorist organization that thinks that all these mass shootings and gun-related deaths are just the price of freedom.Therefore, it comes as no surprise that Dana Loesch, a spokeswoman for the organization, has just released a new advertisement video that can only be described as purely fascist. She attacks anyone and everyone who dares to criticize Trump as saboteurs who wish to take the victory of Trump and his base away. You see, to these people, those who do not support Trump are the REAL threat to the republic, not Trump s fascist, authoritarian regime. Loesch s statement culminates in the following chilling statement: From the highest levels of government, to their media, universities and billionaires, their hateful defiance of his legitimacy is an insult to each of us. So, educational institutions, the free press, anyone and everyone who sees the dangers of Trumpism   we must be dealt with. It comes complete with violent imagery and creepy music to boot.

       " 'GWADAR, Pakistan (Reuters) - China is lavishing vast amounts of aid on a small Pakistani fishing town to win over locals and build a commercial deep-water port that the United States and India suspect may also one day serve the Chinese navy. Beijing has built a school, sent doctors and pledged about $500 million in grants for an airport, hospital, college and badly-needed water infrastructure for Gwadar, a dusty town whose harbor juts out into the Arabian Sea, overlooking some of the world s busiest oil and gas shipping lanes. The grants include $230 million for a new international airport, one of the largest such disbursements China has made abroad, according to researchers and Pakistani officials. The handouts for the Gwadar project is a departure from Beijing s usual approach in other countries. China has traditionally derided Western-style aid in favor of infrastructure projects for which it normally provides loans through Chinese state-owned commercial and development banks.  The concentration of grants is quite striking,  said Andrew Small, an author of a book on China-Pakistan relations and a Washington-based researcher at the German Marshall Fund think tank.  China largely doesn t do aid or grants, and when it has done them, they have tended to be modest.  Pakistan has welcomed the aid with open hands. However, Beijing s unusual largesse has also fueled suspicions in the United States and India that Gwadar is part of China s future geostrategic plans to challenge U.S. naval dominance.  It all suggests that Gwadar, for a lot of people in China, is not just a commercial proposition over the longer term,  Small said. The Chinese Foreign Ministry did not respond to a request for comment from Reuters. Beijing and Islamabad see Gwadar as the future jewel in the crown of the China-Pakistan Economic Corridor (CPEC), a flagship of Beijing s Belt and Road initiative to build a new  Silk Road  of land and maritime trade routes across more than 60 countries in Asia, Europe and Africa. The plan is to turn Gwadar into a trans-shipment hub and megaport to be built alongside special economic zones from which export-focused industries will ship goods worldwide. A web of energy pipelines, roads and rail links will connect Gwadar to China s western regions. Port trade is expected to grow from 1.2 million tonnes in 2018 to about 13 million tonnes by 2022, Pakistani officials say. At the harbor, three new cranes have been installed and dredging will next year deepen the port depth to 20 meters at five berths. But the challenges are stark. Gwadar has no access to drinking water, power blackouts are common and separatist insurgents threaten attacks against Chinese projects in Gwadar and the rest of Baluchistan, a mineral-rich province that is still Pakistan s poorest region. Security is tight, with Chinese and other foreign visitors driven around in convoys of soldiers and armed police. Beijing is also trying to overcome the distrust of outsiders evident in Baluchistan, where indigenous Baloch fear an influx of other ethnic groups and foreigners. Many residents say the pace of change is too slow.  Local people are not completely satisfied,  said Essar Nori, a lawmaker for Gwadar, adding that the separatists were tapping into that dissatisfaction. Pakistani officials are urging Gwadar residents to be patient, vowing to urgently build desalination plants and power stations. China s Gwadar project contrasts with similar efforts in Sri Lanka, where the village of Hambantota was transformed into a port complex - but was saddled with Chinese debt. Last week, Sri Lanka formally handed over operations to China on a 99-year lease in exchange for lighter debt repayments, a move that sparked street protests over what many Sri Lankans view as an erosion of sovereignty. The Hambantota port, like Gwadar, is part of a network of harbors Beijing is developing in Asia and Africa that have spooked India, which fears being encircled by China s growing naval power. But Pakistani officials say comparisons to Hambantota are unfair because the Gwadar project has much less debt. On top of the airport, Chinese handouts in Gwadar include $100 million to expand a hospital by 250 beds, $130 million towards upgrading water infrastructure, and $10 million for a technical and vocational college, according to Pakistani government documents and officials.  We welcome this assistance as it s changing the quality of life of the people of Gwadar for the better,  said Senator Mushahid Hussain Sayed, chairman of the parliamentary committee that oversees CPEC, including Gwadar. China and Pakistan jointly choose which projects will be developed under the CPEC mechanism, Sayed added. When China suggested a 7,000 meter runway for the new airport, Pakistan pushed for a 12,000 meter one that could accommodate planes as large as the Airbus 380 and be used for military purposes, according to Sajjad Baloch, a director of the Gwadar Development Authority. The scale of Chinese grants is extraordinary, according to Brad Parks, executive director of AidData, a research lab at the U.S.-based William and Mary university that collected data on Chinese aid across 140 countries from 2000-2014. Since 2014, Beijing has pledged over $800 million in grants and concessional loans for Gwadar, which has less than 100,000 people. In the 15 years before that, China gave about $2.4 billion in concessional loans and grants during this period across the whole of Pakistan, a nation of 207 million people.  Gwadar is exceptional even by the standards of China s past activities in Pakistan itself,  Parks said. There are early signs China s efforts to win hearts and minds are beginning to bear fruit in Gwadar.  Baluchistan is backward and underdeveloped, but we are seeing development after China s arrival,  said Salam Dashti, 45, a grocer whose two children attend the new Chinese-built primary school. But there are major pitfalls ahead. Tens of thousands of people living by the port will have to be relocated. For now, they live in cramped single-story concrete houses corroded by sea water on a narrow peninsula, where barefoot fishermen offload their catch on newly-paved roads strewn with rubbish. Many of the fishermen say they fear they ll lose their livelihoods once the port starts operating. Indigenous residents  fear of becoming a minority is inevitable with Gwadar s population expected to jump more than 15-fold in coming decades. On the edge of town, mansions erected by land speculators are popping up alongside the sand dunes. Analysts say China is aware that previous efforts to develop Gwadar port failed partly due to the security threat posed by Baloch separatists, so Beijing is trying to counter the insurgents  narrative that China wants to exploit Baluchistan.  That weighs heavily on the minds of the Chinese,  Parks added.  It s almost certainly true that they are trying to safeguard their investments by getting more local buy-in.  Chinese officials, meanwhile, are promoting the infrastructure development they are funding.  Every day you can see new changes. It shows the sincerity of Chinese for development of Gwadar,  Lijian Zhao, the deputy chief of mission at the Chinese embassy in Islamabad, tweeted last month. For its investment in Gwadar, China will receive 91 percent of revenues until the port is returned to Pakistan in four decades  time. The operator, China Overseas Ports Holding Company, will also be exempt from major taxes for more than 20 years. Pakistan s maritime affairs minister, Hasil Bizenjo, said the arrival of the Chinese in the region contrasted with the experience of the past two centuries, when Russia and Britain, and later the United States and the Soviet Union, vied for control of the warm water ports of the Persian Gulf.  The Chinese have come very smoothly, they have reached the warm waters,  Bizenjo told Reuters.  What they are investing is less than a peanut for access to warm waters.  When a U.S. Pentagon report in June suggested Gwadar could become a military base for China, a concern that India has also expressed, Beijing dismissed the idea.  Talk that China is building a military base in Pakistan is pure guesswork,  said a Chinese Defence Ministry spokesman, Wu Qian.  Bizenjo and other Pakistani officials say Beijing has not asked to use Gwadar for naval purposes.  This port, they will use it mostly for their commercial interests, but it depends on the next 20 years where the world goes,  Bizenjo said.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Next month’s Senate election in Wisconsin could gain Silicon Valley a key ally in Washington in the high-tech industry’s battle against the U.S. government’s growing appetite for more access to private data.  Democrat Russ Feingold, 63, the only lawmaker to vote against the USA Patriot Act in 2001, leads incumbent Republican Senator Ron Johnson in the state in opinion polls ahead of the Nov. 8 election. Johnson, 61, rode a wave of support from conservative Tea Party activists to victory six years ago, sweeping Feingold out of office. But polls this year have consistently shown Feingold ahead, although recent surveys show a tighter race. Privacy advocates and former Feingold staffers said they expected Feingold, if returned to office, to be sympathetic to the privacy concerns of technology companies and civil liberties groups on issues such as encryption and domestic spying, at a time when many lawmakers are being pressured to confront security threats from Islamic State and other militant groups. The Feingold campaign did not respond to requests for comment. Apple Inc (AAPL.O), Microsoft Corp (MSFT.O) and other tech giants have tussled in recent years with government agencies over how much user data the companies should be forced to retain and share with investigators hunting for criminal suspects or national security threats.  Those tensions grew after former National Security Agency contractor Edward Snowden leaked secrets about U.S. surveillance practices in 2013. They reached a crescendo earlier this year when the FBI tried to force Apple to unlock an iPhone tied to one of the shooters in a San Bernardino, California, attack that killed 14 people.   Chief among the goals of many companies and privacy advocates is reforming a foreign intelligence authority used to justify once-secret broad internet surveillance programs exposed by Snowden that will expire in December 2017 unless Congress reauthorizes them.    Should Feingold return to Capitol Hill, former staffers said he would probably seek a seat on the Senate Intelligence Committee, where he would have privileged access to classified information about government spying. Feingold’s campaign has received far more contributions than Johnson’s from donors employed by tech companies including Alphabet Inc’s Google (GOOGL.O) and Intel Corp (INTC.O), a review of U.S. Federal Election Commission records showed.  Digital privacy activists have long regarded Feingold as an ally and aggressive overseer of the intelligence community, a reputation he burnished as the sole vote against the USA Patriot Act, which was passed after the Sept. 11 attacks, expanding the government’s surveillance capabilities.  In a speech from the Senate floor at the time, Feingold raised concerns that one provision would allow the government to “go on a fishing expedition and collect information on virtually anyone.” Leaks from Snowden in 2013 showed the provision Feingold questioned was later secretly interpreted to conduct bulk surveillance on U.S. phone metadata. That program was curtailed by Congress in 2015. Feingold “was a true leader in fighting indiscriminate mass surveillance of innocent Americans,” U.S. Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat who also is among congressional skeptics of government spying, said in a statement. Wisconsin typically leans Democratic during high-turnout presidential election years, a problem for Johnson, who won by nearly 5 points in 2010 running as a small-government outsider. “It was pretty clear that 2010 was a wave election and there was nothing that (Feingold) could have done to fend off the challenge from Ron Johnson,” said Kenneth Mayer, a political science professor at the University of Wisconsin-Madison. Johnson has attempted to use Feingold’s 18-year Senate record to portray him as soft on national security. William Allison, a Johnson campaign spokesman, added that Feingold had been “willing to completely mislead Wisconsinites about his weak record on national security.” ',\n",
       " 'You might remember a few months ago, the Bernie Sanders campaign filed a lawsuit against the Democratic National Committee for cutting off access to their own campaign data stored on the servers at DNC headquarters. The cut off came from when a few Sanders staffers found they could access protected, private information of the Hillary Clinton campaign, which was stored on the same servers.The DNC came out quickly and said that the Sanders staffers intentionally exploited software errors to gain access to the Clinton team s proprietary data. Sanders fired back immediately that the error has been a recurring one, and his campaign had attempted to make it known to the DNC that this was happening before, with no success in getting it resolved.DNC Chairwoman Debbie Wasserman Schultz said that the extreme move in cutting off access to the Sanders Campaign of even their own data was the only way to protect the other data on the servers. Wasserman Schultz also said that the Sanders campaign  not only viewed it but exported and downloaded it. Fast forward a few months and an independent investigation later, and it turns out that the DNC gave us the wrong story.After the independent investigation concluded, it was confirmed that the DNC had made assertions about what happened which were not supported by evidence and that the serious level of tampering everyone was led to believe happened did not occur.According to the Sanders campaign statement, the breach did not extend beyond 3 staffers and their manager. They had access for approximately one hour to Clinton campaign scoring models but not to any of the Clinton campaign s proprietary voter data, which was at the heart of initial reports.The Sanders campaign then released a statement saying the original claims by the DNC were  wholly inaccurate  and that the campaign never stole any voter data.The settlement of this lawsuit is a positive thing. However, the problems that led up to it have not been resolved.Over the past several months, more and more scrutiny and criticism have been being visited upon the DNC s leadership, as well as Chairwoman Wasserman Schultz. The data breach issue was an ongoing problem that wasn t resolved in a timely manner, the circumstances were misreported by the DNC and the action they took regarding the security loophole were called by many an overreach.Add on top of this the moves by DNC leadership to open the floodgates for corporate money within the party, as well as the DNC chairwoman s joining with Republicans to attack Elizabeth Warren s Consumer Financial Protection Bureau, and there are many calling for the DNC to find new leadership.It remains to be seen if Wasserman Schultz will keep her seat as a Congresswoman in, due to an unexpected primary challenge she is now facing. However, regardless of if she wins or loses, the DNC s own leadership does need to hold itself to a higher standard of accountability   especially regarding its leadership   for the good of both party unity and taking back Congress this fall.Featured image via wikicommons',\n",
       " ' SEOUL, (Reuters) - In 2009, a pop video from North Korea celebrated a new national hero - one that outside experts would later realize was at the heart of the secretive state s banned nuclear and missile programs.  That hero, widely available in factories across the world, was the Computer Numerical Control (CNC) machine.  Big, grey and boxy, CNC machines use pre-programmed guides to produce intricate parts for everything from automobiles and mobile phones to furniture and clothes. They offer accuracy that human machine tool operators are unable to achieve.  In North Korea, thanks to a combination of homemade technology and reverse engineering, the machines now play a critical role in the weapons programs. They allow Kim Jong Un to build nuclear bombs and missiles without relying as heavily on outside technical aid or imports.  Nuclear weapons experts say this has helped him accelerate missile and nuclear testing despite international sanctions on the transfer of sensitive equipment.  Special Section: North Korea revealed. Interactive: Nuclear North Korea  Interactive: Kim s latest act of defiance  North Korea s centrifuges and new missiles all depend on components made with CNC machine tools,  said Jeffrey Lewis, head of the East Asia Nonproliferation Program at the Middlebury Institute of Strategic Studies at Monterey, California.   (They) are the essential underlying technology for producing missiles and nuclear weapons,  said Lewis.  Since 1996, CNC machines have been included in the Wassenaar Arrangement   an international arms control regime aimed at stopping the proliferation of equipment with both civilian and military uses. North Korea is not a signatory.  The country s celebrations of its CNC technology have been fulsome. Hundreds of dancers in luminous orange and green performed the CNC pop song, titled  Break through the cutting edge,  at a Korean Workers  Party celebration in 2010. In 2012, the year the South Korean hit  Gangnam Style  was released, the North s CNC title was on karaoke machines nationwide, according to Choson Exchange, a Singapore-based company that trains North Koreans in business skills. The official video for the song opens with a long-range North Korean rocket soaring into a blue sky.  North Korea likely started to develop its own CNC machines in the early 1990s as part of a drive to build sophisticated missiles and nuclear weapons, nuclear experts say. It probably learned how to make them by taking apart machines it had imported from the Soviet Union.  Its first homemade CNC machine was introduced in 1995. Former leader Kim Jong Il gave the machine the  Ryonha  brand, according to a 2009 article in the country s official newspaper, Rodong Sinmun. That was the first time state media mentioned the technology.  By 2009, the machines had become a mainstay of North Korean propaganda, as Pyongyang launched a nationwide campaign to boost domestic industry. Sanctions were mounting after its second nuclear test and a long-range missile launch that year.  At the time, arms control experts raised concerns about a visit by former leader Kim Jong Il to a North Korean factory where homemade CNC machines appeared to be producing aluminum tubes. These could be used for nuclear centrifuges.   By around 2010, it seemed they were capable of manufacturing various types of CNC machines,  said Kim Heung-gwang, a North Korean defector who taught at Pyongyang s Hamhung Computer Technology University before defecting to South Korea.  But it wasn t until 2013 that the Korea Ryonha Machinery Joint Venture Corporation, which produced the machines, was blacklisted by the U.N. Security Council for supporting the weapons programs.  And it was only in August this year that U.S. intelligence officials told Reuters North Korea likely has the ability to produce its own missile engines themselves. (Full Story)  Now, Kim Heung-gwang estimates, North Korea has about 15,000 CNC machines. He bases this on North Korean state media reports and photos as well as interviews with more than a dozen defectors who were scientists, professors or factory workers.  Pyongyang hailed the homemade machines as a triumph for its governing ideology of  Juche , which champions self-sufficiency. But that wasn t strictly true.  In August 2016, state media released photos of Kim Jong Un visiting a factory using CNC machines with the logo of Swiss engineering firm ABB ABB.UL, one of the leading players in the global CNC machine market. It s not clear when or how the machine reached North Korea.  ABB said the firm respects all applicable trade sanctions against North Korea, and undertakes not to deliver ABB equipment to the country.  That said, we cannot rule out that some of our equipment may have been resold to DPR of Korea without our knowledge or permission,  the company said in response to a Reuters inquiry, using North Korea s official title.  A United Nations panel monitoring sanctions on North Korea said in a report this year that Tengzhou Keyongda CNC Machine Tools Co of China had been a supplier of Pyongyang s new CNC machines. A sales representative for Tengzhou Keyongda told Reuters the company stopped selling CNC machines to North Korea four years ago, and no longer maintains trade relations with the country.  Despite sanctions, CNC machines are commonplace across North Korean manufacturing and can be brought in through China and Russia, said Lee Choon-geun, a senior fellow at the Science and Technology Policy Institute in South Korea.  The biggest loophole has been that while some CNC machines are banned because they can have both military and civilian functions, most serve civilian industry.  Given their dual-use capability, you could even import the machines for other purposes, take them to pieces and use them however you want,  said Lee.  The CNC song highlights this in its opening line:  Whatever it is, once we put our mind to it, there s a program to make it,  it says.  ',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - A nonprofit watchdog expanded a lawsuit accusing U.S. President Donald Trump of violating the Constitution by letting his hotels and restaurants accept payments from foreign governments. The amended complaint filed on Tuesday in the U.S. District Court in Manhattan adds a restaurant trade group, whose members include nationally known chefs Tom Colicchio and Alice Waters, and a hotel events booker in Washington, D.C. as plaintiffs. It is intended to address concern over whether the watchdog, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington, was itself harmed by Trump and had standing to sue at all. Trump is expected to respond by April 21, and had said the original lawsuit filed on Jan. 23 had no merit. Spokesmen for the U.S. Department of Justice did not immediately respond to requests for comment on Tuesday. The amended complaint said Trump violates the Constitution’s “emoluments” clause, which bars him from accepting various gifts from foreign governments without congressional approval, by maintaining ownership over his business empire despite ceding day-to-day control to his sons, Eric and Donald Jr. It said members of Restaurant Opportunities Centers (ROC) United Inc, which represents more than 200 restaurants and nearly 25,000 workers, have improperly lost business, wages and tips to Trump’s competing businesses. Jill Phaneuf, the other new plaintiff, works for a hospitality company that books events in hotels near Washington’s “Embassy Row,” which house foreign diplomats, and claimed that Trump is costing her commissions. The complaint said such plaintiffs are injured when foreign governments try to “curry favor” with Trump by favoring his businesses. It said this has even occurred since Trump took office, when China granted him trademark rights after he pledged to honor the “One China” policy of his White House predecessors. \"When asked why defendant changed his position on the One China policy, and whether he had gotten something in exchange from China, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer answered: \\'The President always gets something,\\'\" the complaint said. (here) U.S. District Judge Ronnie Abrams, an appointee of former Democratic President Barack Obama, oversees the litigation. The lawsuit seeks to “uphold one of the most basic aspects of the rule of law: no one, including the president, is above the law,” Erwin Chemerinsky, dean of the University of California at Irvine’s law school and one of the plaintiffs’ lawyers, said in a statement. The case is Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington et al v. Trump, U.S. District Court, Southern District of New York, No. 17-00458. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican Senator Pat Toomey and Bob Corker, both members of the Budget Committee, said on Tuesday they had reached an agreement on a budget resolution that would allow for tax cuts over a 10-year period. “While each member of the caucus will have to make their own decision, I believe our agreement gives the tax writing committees enough headroom to achieve real tax reform that eliminates loopholes and lowers tax rates for hardworking Americans,” Corker said in a joint press release with Toomey.

       " '(Reuters) - In addition to picking the next U.S. president on Tuesday, voters in four states will decide on ballot initiatives related to energy and the environment. The results of the initiatives could offer a gauge of Americans’ feelings about managing carbon dioxide emissions, regulating solar power, and handling local opposition to hydraulic fracturing. Here are descriptions of the various initiatives: Washington state voters will decide whether to adopt a measure to create the country’s first carbon tax. Initiative 732 would slap a $15 price tag on a ton of carbon for utilities and refiners in 2017, with the price rising gradually each year until it reaches $100. The tax would be revenue neutral: money raised would replace old revenue from sales and business taxes. Supporters say the tax would bring down emissions without burdening state residents. But the measure has brought together unlikely allies from industry groups who say it would hurt businesses’ bottom lines and environmental organizations like the Sierra Club who say it does not create new revenue to invest in clean energy and mass transit. Other groups argue it could hurt lower-income communities. Florida’s electric utilities have sponsored a measure that could affect how the state regulates private use of solar energy. A confusingly worded Amendment 1 would alter the state’s constitution to protect the right to own or lease solar equipment, while also ensuring that electricity consumers who do not use solar energy “are not required to subsidize the costs of back-up power and electric grid access to those who do.” Supporters say it enshrines the rights of solar users, but opponents say it is a sneaky way of letting the state block ‘net metering,’ in which a solar user can sell unused energy on the grid at market value. Floridians for Solar Choice say the measure would “choke off” the state’s nascent rooftop solar industry. Colorado voters will vote on a measure that would make it harder to change the state’s constitution by requiring broad support across all state districts for signatories to petitions and a higher percentage threshold  to be approved.  Opponents of hydraulic fracturing, an oil and gas drilling technique they say causes water pollution, claim Amendment 71 would make it harder for local communities to block fracking projects. The amendment was written and funded by oil and gas industry groups but does not directly address the controversial practice. Colorado is one of several U.S. states that has seen a surge in fracking in recent years. Scores of towns across the country, including several in Colorado, have tried to ban it. Nevada voters will decide whether to open up the state’s energy market to competition by giving consumers the option to decide where they buy their power. The measure comes after state regulators last year approved a rate increase for customers with rooftop solar panels, causing solar companies to lay off workers. Currently, Nevada law allows investor-owned utility companies to be monopolies in their service territories. Supported by environmentalists as well as electric carmaker Tesla, MGM Resorts and other companies, the measure would let consumers choose an energy provider and sell the solar electricity they generate themselves. Big companies that want to leave the grid can do so by paying hefty penalties to state regulators. If passed, the measure would direct the Nevada Legislature to pass legislation to create an open, competitive electricity market by mid-2023. ',\n",
       " 'Kellogg Co. is pulling its ads from the website Breitbart News, the right-wing news organization whose former chairman Steve Bannon was tapped as a top adviser to President-elect Donald Trump.Brands that advertise on Breitbart have drawn flak in recent weeks, with activists saying the website espouses racist and anti-Semitic views. A screen shot showing an advertisement for Kellogg s Frosted Mini Wheats was part of an online campaign to get marketers to abandon the site. We regularly work with our media-buying partners to ensure our ads do not appear on sites that aren t aligned with our values as a company,  said Kris Charles, a spokeswoman for Kellogg, which also makes Frosted Flakes and Special K cereal.  We recently reviewed the list of sites where our ads can be placed and decided to discontinue advertising on Breitbart.com. We are working to remove our ads from that site. AppNexus Inc., one of the biggest digital advertising services, barred Breitbart from using its ad-serving tools earlier this month because it felt the publisher violated its hate-speech rules.AppNexus scrutinized Breitbart s website after Bannon was given the White House post. The digital ad firm decided the publication had breached a policy against content that incites violence, according to a spokesman for the company. Kellogg declined to name the third-party company that places its digital ads.Kellogg is the latest major brand to pull its online advertising from the news site. Other companies   including Allstate, Nest, EarthLink, Warby Parker and SoFi   have also blacklisted Breitbart from showing their ads, according to Digiday.The site had 19.2 million unique monthly U.S. visitors in October, up from 12.9 million a year ago, according to ComScore Inc. Breitbart doesn t rely on subscriptions, suggesting that advertising is a major source of revenue.Many marketers buy online advertising through third-party tech companies that distribute them widely across the internet, so they may not be aware of all the websites where they appear. But they also have the ability to control which websites display their ads. The creator of the Twitter account Sleeping Giants has been taking screen shots of ads appearing on Breitbart in an attempt to pressure those brands to take their ads down.Not all brands are shying away from advertising on Breitbart, though. After a screenshot showed a Nissan ad on the website, the automaker said in a statement that it  places ads in a variety of sites in order to reach as many consumers as possible. The placement of Nissan advertising is not intended to be a political commentary and there are no plans to change the advertising mix at this time,  the company said.   Bloomberg',\n",

Holland, 70, joined the five-member court as the youngest ever to serve in 1986 and became the longest-serving member in 2009.  A replacement will be nominated by Governor John Carney, who took office last month, and must be confirmed by the state’s senate. Justices serve 12-year terms. “I just feel that after 30 years it is time to retire,” said Holland in a statement. “I’m looking forward to pursuing other opportunities, like teaching.” A majority of publicly traded U.S. companies are chartered in Delaware and the court plays a key role interpreting the state’s corporate law and has decided many billion dollar merger disputes. The court recently dismissed a $171 million investor lawsuit against pipeline operator Kinder Morgan Inc and revived a lawsuit against Zynga Inc’s controlling shareholder, Mark Pincus, over sales of the social gaming company’s stock. The court is also expected to rule in the coming months on a heated lawsuit that could decide control of one of the world’s largest translation services companies, TransPerfect Global Inc. Holland was the remaining justice on the court who had been appointed prior to Leo Strine becoming the court’s chief justice in 2014. Strine was elevated from the role of chancellor, or chief judge, of the Court of Chancery, which specializes in corporate disputes. ',\n",

A lawsuit, which a judge threw out immediately because it was bogus, as Maher explains.Maher asked Conway whether Trump had encouraged her to be on the show and she confirmed that he did. That s because, as Maher pointed out, Trump is desperately after his show s audience demographic. While Conway may have been happy to get to speak to that audience in the beginning of the segment, she certainly isn t happy now. That s because Maher confronts the only person has been so far able to  tame  Trump, as Maher puts it, and informs her that her boss is a habitual liar. I don t know anything about David Duke.  Utter lie.  Vladimir Putin and I are best friends.  He never met him. He  got a letter from the NFL,  which was proved never happened. He gave money to the veterans when he didn t.  I was against the Iraq war,  when it s on tape that he was not,  Maher says.This point becomes comedy gold later in the segment when Conway insists that she could never work for someone who lies for a living. How do you answer to the fact that this man just says whatever he wants at the moment in the moment to get whatever point he wants across regardless of the facts? Conway dodged the question and took the opportunity to posture, saying she has been with the campaign with a winning candidate.That s when Maher asks Conway: You have many children. Are you okay with what your children are going to be asking you about supporting a man, enabling a man, who did things like make fun of the handicapped and said John McCain wasn t a war hero? Conway says that she is fine with backing Trump after doing that, saying that McCain has endorsed Trump.Maher concluded the segment by asking Conway to tell Trump not to sue him anymore.I wish Maher had expanded on his question regarding Conway s children.

       " 'SINGAPORE (Reuters) - Singapore has banned two Muslim foreign preachers from entering the city-state because their views bred intolerance and were a risk to its social harmony, the government said on Monday. The decision to block Ismail Menk, identified by local media as a Zimbabwean and Haslin bin Baharim as a Malaysian, is the latest move by the Singaporean authorities to put a curb on individuals from spreading divisive views. Menk has preached Muslims are not allowed to greet people of other faiths on their religious festivals, Singapore s home affairs ministry said in a statement.  It accused Baharim of holding views that promote discord between Muslims and non-Muslims, whom he described as  deviant.   (Their views) are unacceptable in the context of Singapore s multi-racial and multi-religious society,  the ministry said.  Reuters was not in a position to reach out to the pair. Singapore is predominantly Chinese, many of whom follow Buddhism and Taoism but 14 percent of the population is Muslim and nearly 19 percent Christian.   Authorities in the city-state, an outpost of stability in a region where religious tension is not uncommon, are sensitive to public remarks they deem might adversely affect religious and social harmony. Over the past few years, Singapore increased its level of surveillance for Islamist radicalism as concern grew about the spread of Islamic State in the region. Menk and Baharim planned to conduct religious sessions on a ship departing from Singapore next month after their applications for short-term work passes to preach in Singapore were turned down, the government said.     They will not be allowed to get around the ban by preaching instead on cruise ships which operate to and from Singapore,  the home ministry said. Last month, authorities said they rejected applications for two foreign Christian preachers to speak in Singapore as they had made  denigrating and inflammatory comments of other religions.  ',\n",
       " 'BERLIN (Reuters) - Actor and activist Richard Gere said on Friday that U.S. President Donald Trump has managed to merge the meaning of the words “refugee” and “terrorist” in the minds of many Americans. Gere also told a news conference at the Berlin Film Festival just before the world premiere of his new film “The Dinner” that he found it discouraging to see term “refugee” go through such a dispiriting change of meaning in the United States.  “The most horrible thing that Trump has done is conflated two words – refugee and terrorist,” Gere, 67, told more than 100 journalists. “It means the same thing in the U.S. now. That’s what he’s accomplished to a large segment of our population.” Trump ordered a travel ban on refugees and citizens from seven Muslim-majority countries on Jan. 27. A U.S. appeal court in San Francisco refused to reinstate a temporary ban on the order. Trump criticized the court decision. “A ‘refugee’ used to be someone that we had empathy for ...someone we wanted to help who we wanted to give refuge to,” Gere said.  “...Now we’re afraid of them and this ...is the biggest crime in itself: conflating these two ideas.” Gere met Chancellor Angela Merkel this week while in Berlin for the festival. She told Trump in a phone call two weeks ago the global fight against terrorism was no excuse for banning people from Muslim-majority countries. In the film “The Dinner”, Gere plays a famous politician who meets his wife and his brother at a hip restaurant to discuss a horrible crime committed by their sons.  In an interview with Reuters before the news conference, Gere said he was encouraged by protests in the United States against Trump’s policies. “I am essentially an optimist so I am seeing this as an opportunity for people to show up the day after he was inaugurated,” Gere said. “There were millions of people in the streets in New York. It wasn’t angry demonstrations. It was positive demonstrations that were kind of a unity of purpose.” More than a million migrants, many of them fleeing conflict and persecution, have arrived in Germany over the last two years.  “The Dinner” is one of 18 films at the ‘Berlinale’, competing for Golden and Silver Bears. The festival runs until Feb. 19. ',\n",

       " 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - The Kremlin said on Tuesday a call by opposition leader Alexei Navalny to boycott next year s presidential election must be checked to see if it complies with the law, paving the way for possible police action against him and his supporters. Navalny called on Monday for a boycott of the March 18 election after Russia s central election commission ruled he was not eligible to run for president due to a suspended prison sentence hanging over him.  The calls for a boycott will require scrupulous study, to see whether or not they comply with the law,  Kremlin spokesman Dmitry Peskov told reporters on a conference call.  Declining to comment on the election commission s decision,  Peskov shrugged off allegations that the presidential poll would be a farce without Navalny.   The fact that one of the would-be candidates is not taking part has no bearing on the election s legitimacy,  said Peskov. Navalny, a 41-year-old lawyer, has repeatedly said the suspended sentence handed to him in an embezzlement case was politically motivated. On Monday Navalny said millions of voters would be disenfranchised without his participation in the election, which opinion polls show incumbent Vladimir Putin winning comfortably. The European Union also questioned the Russian election commission s decision to bar Navalny.  (It) casts a serious doubt on political pluralism in Russia and the prospect of democratic elections next year,  the EU s External Action Service said in a statement on Tuesday.  Politically motivated charges should not be used against political participation,  it said, urging Moscow to ensure a  level playing field  for all Russian elections. Putin, 65, has dominated Russia s political landscape for the last 17 years and if, as expected, he wins next year s election would be eligible to serve another six years until 2024, when he turns 72. Allies laud Putin as a father-of-the-nation figure who has restored national pride and expanded Moscow s global clout with interventions in Syria and Ukraine. Navalny says Putin s support is exaggerated and artificially maintained by a biased state media and an unfair system which excludes genuine opponents. He says he could defeat him in a fair election, an assertion Putin s supporters have laughed off. Navalny has been jailed three times this year and charged with breaking the law for organizing public meetings and rallies designed to bolster his presidential campaign.    ',\n",

In response, the International Committee of the Red Cross shut down activities across Equatoria, a region roughly the size of Britain that borders Congo and Uganda and has seen some of the heaviest fighting over the last year. The suspension affected more than 22,000 people about to get aid deliveries from the Red Cross. That included more than 5,000 farmers due to receive seeds in an area teetering on the edge of famine.       The ICRC will not resume anything until we have a clear picture of exactly what happened and until we receive the necessary security guarantees,  spokeswoman Mari Mortvedt told Reuters. The security of the ICRC staff is top priority.  The U.N. s Office for Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs  told Reuters that no aid group had shut down its operations over such a large area since South Sudan s civil war began in 2013.  The conflict began after President Salva Kiir, an ethnic Dinka, fired his deputy Riek Machar, an ethnic Nuer. The U.N. says ethnic cleansing has taken place and warned of genocide, amid reports of murder, rape, and torture of civilians. More than two million South Sudanese have now fled the country, creating Africa s biggest refugee crisis since the 1994 Rwandan genocide, and more than half of those remaining need food aid. The country s original population was 12 million.  At least 85 aid workers have been killed, according to the U.N., including 18 this year, making it the deadliest country for aid workers in the world. That number did not include a staff member for aid group World Vision, killed in the Western Equatoria town of Yambio on September 3. It was not clear whether that death was related to his work as an aid worker, so it was not included in the total, the group said.  (This story corrects to make clear World Vision aid worker not included in total of 85)  ',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - Over 7.4 million homes and businesses were without power in Florida, Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama because of Hurricane Irma, according to state officials and utilities on Monday.  Most outages were in Florida Power & Light s service area in the southern and eastern parts of the state. A unit of NextEra Energy Inc and the state s biggest power company, FPL said its outages dipped to around 3.4 million by Monday evening from a peak of 3.6 million earlier in the day. As the storm weakens as it heads toward Georgia, outages have leveled off or even declined at other Florida utilities, while increasing in Georgia, South Carolina and Alabama. Florida outages for Duke Energy Corp, which serves the northern and central parts of the state, increased to almost 1.2 million, according to the company s website. Irma hit southwest Florida on Sunday morning as a dangerous Category 4 storm, the second-highest level on the five-step Saffir-Simpson scale. It gradually weakened to a tropical storm by Monday morning.  The storm, which was moving into southern Georgia, was packing maximum sustained winds of 60 miles (97 km) per hour, according to the U.S. National Hurricane Center s latest update at 2 p.m. EDT (1800 GMT). In Georgia, utilities reported about 950,000 customers without power. Other big power utilities in Florida are units of Emera Inc and Southern Co, which also operates the biggest electric companies in Georgia and Alabama. ',\n",
       " 'JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel expressed muted concern on Sunday to a major arms deal between the United States and Saudi Arabia announced a day earlier during the visit to the region by U.S. President Donald Trump.  The central achievement of Trump’s visit to Saudi Arabia was  nearly $110 billion in deals sealed on Saturday in which Riyadh will buy U.S. arms to help it counter Iran, with options running as high as $350 billion over 10 years. Although Israel also sees Iran as a threat to its security, it has a military advantage over the Arab states and has always been concerned about arms sales to them that could possibly narrow the margin separating them. “This is a matter that really should trouble us,” said Israeli Energy Minister Yuval Steinitz prior to the weekly cabinet meeting, although Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu made no mention of the deal in his customary public remarks. A senior U.S. official traveling with Trump said Washington understands what he described as Israel’s “completely legitimate” concerns and pledged to help the Jewish state maintain its military advantage. “We’re taking a whole bunch of measures, some apparent some not so apparent, to ensure Israel’s qualitative military edge. That will in no way be compromised,” the official told Reuters.  “You’ll hear a really strong statement from the president on his commitment to Israel and to Israel’s defense,” the official added.  Netanyahu has expressed the wish to improve ties with Saudi Arabia and other Gulf states as part of an initiative that would draw the Palestinians into an eventual peace deal and function as a broad front against Iran’s nuclear ambitions. Steinitz said he hoped to hear details of the deal. Trump and his entourage touch down in Israel on Monday. “We have also to make sure that those hundreds of billions of dollars of weapons to Saudi Arabia will not, by any means, erode Israel’s qualitative edge, because Saudi Arabia is still a hostile country without any diplomatic relations and nobody knows what the future will be,” Steinitz said. In the 1980s, Israel expressed its concern at a U.S. sale to Saudi Arabia of then-advanced F-15 fighter jets that were stationed at a Red Sea airfield. But the desert kingdom has never threatened to use them against Israel.  ',\n",

       " 'GOTHENBURG, Sweden (Reuters) - European Union leaders will press Theresa May to meet their conditions soon for launching post-Brexit trade talks when she holds talks on the sidelines of a summit in Sweden on Friday, EU officials said. The British prime minister dismissed via a spokesman a report on Thursday that she was ready to raise her offer of cash to settle London s obligations to the Union on leaving but a top EU lawmaker said he came away from a meeting with May in London optimistic that Britain was moving towards a deal with Brussels. At the Gothenburg talks devoted to labor and social reform, May will have a chance to speak to her peers on the sidelines   though German Chancellor Angela Merkel will skip the event. A key moment may be May s meeting before lunch with Donald Tusk, the summit chair who is overseeing the withdrawal process. Tusk will remind May, according to an EU source, that  time is short  to deliver on hopes raised at an EU summit in October that sufficient progress would be made toward agreeing divorce terms this month that leaders would give a green light in mid-December to opening talks on the future relationship. The Union s chief negotiator, Michel Barnier, has said he needs to hear more from Britain on three key divorce conditions, including the financial settlement, by the start of next month if the EU is to be in a position for all 27 other national leaders to trigger the second phase at a summit on Dec. 14-15. EU officials have begun internal preparations to be able to launch trade negotiations after the summit, the source noted, but added:  Tusk will inform May that such a positive scenario is not a given, will require more work and that time is short.   And he will ask May how the UK plans to progress on the three key issues for Phase One.  May s spokesman described as  speculation  a newspaper report that she was planning to spend another 20 billion pounds (26 billion euros) to settle EU demands for Britain to pay its share of spending the EU has already agreed during British membership but will not actually pay out until after it leaves.  I would say it is yet more speculation,  he said.  We want to make progress as quickly as possible and we want to move onto talks about the future relationship as quickly as possible.  A further 26 billion euros would go a long way to meeting a demand that Brussels has put at around 60 billion euros. That is because May has already asked for a two-year transition period after Brexit in March 2019. That would bring in some 20 billion euros as Britain would go on contributing to the budget to retain its full membership of the European single market. A Merkel ally in Brussels, Manfred Weber, the German leader of the center-right bloc in the European Parliament, struck a notably upbeat tone after meeting May and other key British ministers in London on Tuesday. While insisting he had not heard concrete new proposals   that is not his role   he came away believing the British wanted to move toward a divorce deal.  My main message is I am more optimistic,  he told reporters.  There is progress.  As well as the Brexit  bill , Brussels also wants Britain to offer more in the way of rights for EU citizens living there and ensuring that its border with Ireland will remain unobstructed while also not creating a loophole in EU customs arrangements.

       " 'In September 2016, Stephen Henderson, the editorial editor of the Detroit Free Press, used the power of his pen to unjustly attack Kid Rock, after liberals feared Rock might actually be serious about running as a Republican contender against the do-nothing Democrat Senator Debbie Stabenow. As a Michigan resident, I can say with a great level of confidence, that besides Mike Illitch, the now deceased owner of the Red Wings and Detroit Tigers, Kid Rock has done more for the city of Detroit and for the black community than almost anyone in this state. When the Illitch s asked Detroit legend and philanthropist, Kid Rock to perform for the opening of their much anticipated Little Caesar s Arena, no one could have dreamed that the Detroit Free Press  Stephen Henderson would have used his position to push a lie, that Kid Rock, the single father of a black son, and NAACP award recipient is a  racist .Here s what Henderson had to say about Kid Rock, the man who has done so much for the city of Detroit:This is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem. Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Here is how Kid Rock responded on his Facebook page:People! Pay NO attention to the garbage the extreme left is trying to create! (and by the way, fuck the extreme left and the extreme right!)They are trying to use the old confederate flag BS, etc. to stir the pot, when we all know none of this would be going on if I were not thinking of running for office. Pretty funny how scared I have them all and their only agenda is to try and label people / me racist who do not agree or cower to them!! No one had a word to say when we sold out the 6 shows at LCA back in January! My track record in Detroit and Michigan speaks for itself, and I would dare anyone talking trash to put theirs up against mine. I am also a homeowner and taxpayer in the city of Detroit, so suck on that too!I am the bona fide KING OF DETROIT LOVE and it makes me smile down deep that you haters know that! Your jealousy is merely a reflection of disgust for your own failures and lack of positive ideas for our city.I am however very disappointed that none of the people, businesses or charities I have so diligently supported in Detroit have had anything to say about all these unfounded attacks from these handful of jackasses and The Detroit Free Press. So for the unforeseen future I will focus my philanthropy efforts on other organizations besides the ones I have supported in the past. I would however employ that NAN go ahead and make up these losses since they claim to be so good for Detroit and do not want me opening the arena and generating tons of jobs and tax dollars for the city and people I LOVE  IDIOTS!  .. (Has Al Sharpton even paid his back taxes yet?)Today, the race-obsessed Stephen Henderson, got some very bad news AP   The Detroit Free Press fired Stephen Henderson, its managing director of opinion and commentary, after finding what it called credible allegations of inappropriate behavior with female colleagues, the newspaper announced Friday.Free Press Editor and Vice President Peter Bhatia announced Henderson s termination in a story that said the allegations go back several years. Gannett Co. Inc., the newspaper s parent company, says Henderson s behavior  has been inconsistent with company values and standards. Henderson said in a statement to The Detroit News and Crain s Detroit Business that he is  stunned. I dedicated 18 years to this newspaper over three decades, all of it performing at the highest level,  Henderson said.  I may have more to say on this later, but for now there is much other work to be done here in the city of Detroit. Stephen is a magnificent journalist and a treasured colleague who has done so much for Detroit,  Bhatia said. He added there were no accusations of sexual assault, but said the incidents involving inappropriate behavior and comments directed at Free Press employees ran counter to company policies.Less than 2 months ago, Henderson appeared on Meet The Press and called America a racist nation with a racist history:Rich Lowry of the National Review appeared with Stephen Henderson on Meet The Press to discuss Colin Kaepernick and other NFL players who disrespect the flag as a way to support Black Lives Matter. Henderson argued,  Some of the words in the national anthem are racist.  Henderson argued that it was appropriate to show disrespect for the American flag because he thinks America is a country whose history is racist. Henderson told the panel,  I think this is a country whose history is racist, whose history is steeped in white supremacy, and the anthem reflects that in its very words   (inaudible) . Lowry responded to Henderson by saying,  It s also a nation with very important ideals that have worn down those injustices over time and created a more just society.

       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - British Prime Minister Theresa May said on Wednesday the government has confidence in its relationship with the United States, and will continue to share intelligence with Britain’s most important defense and security ally. President Donald Trump has defended his decision to discuss intelligence with the Russians during a White House meeting last week, saying he had an “absolute right” to share “facts pertaining to terrorism and airline flight safety”.  “Decisions about what President Trump discusses with anybody that he has in the White House is a matter for President Trump,” May told a news conference when asked whether Trump’s disclosure had made her reluctant to share intelligence with him. “We continue to work with the United States and continue to share intelligence with the United States as we do with others around the world because we are all working together to deal with the threats that we face.” The question came during a press briefing ahead of Britain’s June 8 election, which polls show May is on course to win, and in which national security is seen as one of her political strengths. May is a former interior minister who spent six years in charge of the domestic security brief. May was the first foreign leader to meet with Trump following his inauguration, and has repeatedly reaffirmed the special relationship between the two countries: a military and economic alliance dating back to 19th century. Trump has endured a week of tumult at the White House after he fired the head of the FBI and then discussed sensitive national security information about Islamic State with Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov. But, May said she remained confident in the special relationship, highlighting the need to cooperate with the United States and other allies to counter the security threats posed by Islamic State and al-Qaeda. “We continue to work together and we have confidence in that relationship between us and the United States that it helps to keep us all safer,” she said.

       " 'Who could forget Mitt Romney s second and third debates with Barack Obama? After the first debate, most Americans were pretty sure that Mitt had successfully exposed Barack as the amateur that he is. But something strange and unexpected happened when Mitt came back for round two. Either he was given bad advice, or he just decided he really didn t want to be President after all. Whatever the case, the next two debates for Mitt were abysmal. He clearly rolled over and played dead, while Barack, with the help of his co-debater Candy Crowley, lied to the american people, as Mitt stood by idly and never uttered a single objection. That was the night Mitt passed on the keys to the White House in favor of civility. Sorry America, but civility doesn t work with the Left who has shown a clear pattern of winning at all cost no matter the consequences America is counting on Trump to use every resource available to take down Hillary in the first debate. If Hillary enabled her husband to prey on, rape or to use his position as President of the United States to gain sexual favors in the Oval Office, we expect Trump to bring it up. We also expect him to answer to all of the women who claimed Hillary threatened them if they spoke out against her perve If Hillary really is the champion of women that she claims to be, she should be ready and willing to defend herself. Please Trump, we beg of you  don t pull a  Romney! It s up to Hillary Clinton whether or not the first presidential debate ends up including an exchange over her husband s White House affair with Monica Lewinsky, Republican Donald Trump said Monday night. I don t think I m looking to do that,  Trump told Fox News host Bill O Reilly when asked whether he was planning to bring up the affair   something Trump raised in media interviews during the primaries. I don t know what I m going to do that exactly. It depends on what level she hits you with, if she s fair, if it s unfair,  Trump said.  But certainly I m not looking to do that. Trump, who slashed through his GOP opponents one-by-one in televised debates during the primaries, said he ll decide on the spot whether to launch personal attacks on Hillary Clinton based on whether she treats him with  respect. I have absolutely no idea. I think this. If she treats me with respect, I will treat her with respect. It really depends,  Trump said.Watch here:https://youtu.be/BnLtdAlfuuM People ask me that question,  oh you re going to go out there and do this and that. I really don t know that. You re going to have to feel it out when you re out there. She s got to treat me with respect. I m going to treat her with respect. I d like to start off by saying that because that would be my intention,  he said.One longtime Clinton advisor isn t so sure Trump will unilaterally disarm when it comes to Lewinsky. You can t put it beyond Trump that Monica Lewinsky will play a role in this debate,  former Clinton and White House counsel Greg Craig told Politico in August. She s got to be prepared to deal with the [Clinton] Foundation and Wall Street and super PACs and all of that. They need to be less focused on dealing with his policy proposals and more on dealing with the unexpected. He s going to be in attack mode, probably the whole time,  Craig said.At several stages in the campaign, Trump has brought up Lewinsky, Bill Clinton rape accuser Juanita Broderick, Whitewater, the death of former Clinton aide Vince Foster, and other 90s era scandals and allegations.

       " 'UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - France made a new plea on Monday for the United States to preserve the 2015 Iran nuclear deal and suggested its provisions expiring after a decade could be strengthened, as U.S. President Donald Trump again criticized the agreement as “deeply flawed.” The pact between Tehran and six world powers, which calls for Iran to curb its nuclear program in return for relief from economic sanctions, is under threat as Trump must decide by Oct. 15 whether to certify Iran is keeping its end of the bargain. If Trump, who as recently as Thursday accused Iran of violating “the spirit” of the deal, chooses not to certify, the pact could unravel, possibly triggering a regional arms race. The Republican president, who has called the agreement struck under his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, “the worst deal ever negotiated,” made no secret of his views during a meeting with French President Emmanuel Macron. “The president believes that the JCPOA is deeply flawed, and he did share his views with President Macron about how he believes the deal is flawed,” Brian Hook, director of policy planning at the U.S. State Department, told reporters. The pact is formally called the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action. “The president was very candid with him about what he thinks are the shortcomings. ... He told him that it is under review and that they are taking a hard look at the Oct. 15th decision and more broadly how to fix the Iran deal,” Hook said. Hook said the two also discussed an integrated strategy against Iran that would take into account what he described as Iran’s support for terrorism, its ballistic missile program, its destabilization in the Middle East and other aggressions. Asked if he planned to stick with the pact, Trump earlier told reporters as he began a meeting with Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu on Monday: “You’ll be seeing very soon.”Israeli officials have said changes Israel wants in the JCPOA include lengthening the 10-year freeze on Iran’s nuclear development program or even making that suspension permanent and destroying centrifuges rather than just halting their operation.  The deal was negotiated with Iran by the United States, Russia, China, Britain, Germany and France. The six will meet with Iran at the ministerial level on Wednesday.          The prospect of Washington reneging on the agreement has worried some of the U.S. allies that helped negotiate it, especially as the world grapples with another nuclear crisis, North Korea’s nuclear and ballistic missile development. “It is essential to maintain it to avoid proliferation. In this period when we see the risks with North Korea, we must maintain this line,” French Foreign Minister Jean-Yves Le Drian told reporters. “France will try to convince President Trump of the pertinence of this choice (keeping the accord), even if work can be done to complement the accord after 2025,” he said. A senior French official said Trump had not given Macron an indication on whether he had made up his mind during their Monday bilateral.  However, the official said Macron had put on the table the prospect of new nuclear negotiations after 2025 during his bilateral with Iranian President Hasan Rouhani and warned him that Tehran should stop provoking the United States with its regional activities. “We feel the post 2025 subject is a red line, but our president put it on the table because it’s a concern and a legitimate request that we must make,” the official said. “2025 will arrive quickly and we have to be ready before Jan 1. 2025, so he asked that we think together how to work on this question.”  If Trump does not certify that Iran is complying with the agreement, the U.S. Congress will have 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions waived under the deal. Iran Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei warned on Sunday that Tehran would react strongly to any “wrong move” by Washington on the nuclear deal. Paris took one of the hardest lines against Tehran in the negotiations, but has been quick to restore trade ties and Macron has said repeatedly there is no alternative to the deal.  French officials say Iran is respecting the JCPOA and that, were the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA) to say otherwise, a mechanism exists to reimpose sanctions. The IAEA is the body ensuring the accord is carried out, but the United States and Iran quarreled over how Tehran’s nuclear activities should be policed at an IAEA meeting on Monday after a U.S. call last month for wider inspections. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson argued on Friday that Washington must consider the full threat it says Iran poses to the Middle East when crafting its new policy toward Tehran. A senior French diplomat underlined that the nuclear deal was achieved in large part because it was not linked to all the other grievances the United States may have had with Iran. With Europeans not on the same page as the Trump administration, Iranian officials say they have an opportunity to divide the P5+1 group that negotiated the deal with Iran. A senior Iranian diplomat and a former nuclear negotiator said he believed the Europeans had no intention of following Trump’s overtly aggressive Iran policy. “They are wise. Look at the region. Crisis everywhere. From Iraq to Lebanon. Iran is a reliable regional partner for Europe, not only a trade partner but a political one as well,” the diplomat said. “European powers have been committed to the deal. The IAEA has repeatedly confirmed Iran’s commitment to the deal. Trump’s insistence on his hostile policy towards Iran will further deepen the gap among the P5+1 countries,” the diplomat said. ',\n",

       " 'The race is heating up as New York heads into their primary this coming Tuesday. Currently, polls have Hillary Clinton ahead by ten to seventeen points. Clinton, who is ahead nationally by more than 200 pledged delegates and hundreds more superdelegates, will need to win her home state to continue momentum after Sanders  string of wins in the previous weeks.A New York win for Clinton will mean more delegates she desperately needs, and with that will come superdelegate support.But the superdelegates have continued to cause controversy within the Democratic primary. Supporters who back Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders have decried the system, feeling the individuals who make up the superdelegate system have been manifestly unfair as to how they allocate their support.Supporters within the Sanders camp have demanded that the superdelegates vote the same way as the pledged   at the will of the voters for that state.But that isn t how the superdelegate system is set up (another word for superdelegates is unpledged delegates).However, that hasn t stopped the demands. And it hasn t stopped the harsh criticism, either. While these delegates have been regarded as  shills,   bought-and-paid-for  and  establishment, one superdelegate wants to remind the nay-sayers of one thing: they are still human.Senator Tammy Baldwin of Wisconsin, Congress  first openly-lesbian senator, is also a superdelegate. And she s pretty fed up with the inquisitions. On MSNBC s Morning Joe, the progressive senator claimed if Sanders clinches the popular vote by the time the convention is held in July, she will cast her vote for him. However, as Clinton continues her popular vote lead, she s supporting the former Secretary of State. She added, nervously: I am a human being and a Superdelegate. To put it plainly, based on how the rules are set up, Baldwin is free to vote her conscience, and her conscience says Hillary Clinton for now. Those who back Senator Sanders point to the fact he beat Clinton by 13 points in Wisconsin, thus Baldwin is somehow obligated to back him.It is important to remember that these superdelegates are party leaders who, in their own right, have been elected within the Democratic Party   whether it be a position within the DNC, or a senatorial, gubernatorial or representative position. It s also important to remember these delegates have nothing but the best of intentions for their party and the future of the country.Baldwin hasn t reported any harassment, but other superdelegates have (one s 12 year old child received the brunt of hrrasment when they answered the phone).Here s Baldwin s appearance on MSNBC:  Featured image via Astrid Riecken/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'Dr. Gina Loudon is hands down one of our favorite conservative writers. She nails it with this piece about the truth behind the lies of the California drought I found it supremely ironic this week that two of the big stories were about a man-made lack of water in California, and a man lost in a vast sea off of Florida.Gov. Jerry  Moonbeam  Brown announced the dire circumstances, not from the Capitol in Sacramento, but from the dramatic backdrop of a mountaintop. His narrative held that there should be five feet of  snow pack,  but alas, there was none. Brown, and the radical Marxists, couched as  environmentalists  he represents, have convinced most Americans to hold two radically opposing views simultaneously. Ostensibly, California is in danger of being flooded by rising sea levels caused by global warming and melting polar ice caps, and it is also utterly out of water.There is no shortage of water. This is an environmentalist-created drought that is costing billions.I waver between utter disgust and admiration when I watch how the leftists sell these things, always with straight faces. Every major news outlet in America and many around the world swallowed the narrative like fish on a baited hook. They tell us there is no water, no snow to provide water for the summer, and the farmers are taking too much so people must suffer. There is an all-out war on grass, and no one is safe. Sorry, Shaggy, your  grass  is to blame as well.There is hand wringing in every club house as the boards are told they are coming for the rough grass, your fairways and greens are safe, for now. Evil rich guys in colorful knickers and almond farmers in overalls are the scourge of California. Off with their heads! Oh, and you can forget about the luxury of children playing on the lawn. If you want that, you breeders should move to flyover land! Don t you dare sneak and water the backyard after dark; Brown makes it easy for your neighbors to snitch on you. I m not making this up. They really have a state hotline for that.Those of us who pay attention know well the proverb,  Where there is no vision, the people perish.  The people who built California into the greatest agricultural producer in America gave us dams, canals, reservoirs and all kinds of conveyance of water. They harnessed the rivers that reach from the Pacific Northwest down well into Northern California and even draw water to the Golden State from the Colorado River. That was then. Nothing has changed since then, except political power.For the last several decades, the radical fringe has taken full control of California, and it hates people. Dennis Prager observed that statists love humanity but hate humans. Watch how they latch onto dreams of egalitarian states but begin the execution of their plans by marginalizing, isolating and then executing anyone who disagrees with them. They dine in the finest restaurants in San Francisco, the likes of Brown, Pelosi, Boxer and Feinstein, planning lawsuits to cut the flow of water to the farms of Central California and the people in Southern California, caring not a wit that 40,000 agricultural workers, mostly Hispanic, are unemployed.Just this week, in the middle of a human crisis, federal fish agents ordered the release of billions of gallons of water purportedly to save six fish. You read that right. Not to save six species of fish, but literally, six fish. Apparently, these special six stood their, err ground, and when 29 of their compadres rode the 10 billion gallon man-made wave to the ocean in March, they refused to go with the flow (sorry).You can t make this stuff up. But when you do, people actually believe it.So Obama administration agents want a second toilet flush to give these hard-headed steelheads a second nudge. The idea that nature itself may be holding the fish where they are is of no concern to statists who love telling both man and beast what they think is good for them. Sadly, this latest mind-boggling atrocity is getting very little media coverage. I found excellent coverage in the Manteca Bulletin. Why hasn t the Los Angeles Times reported on this?The current shortage is based primarily on the release of billions of gallons daily into the San Francisco Bay to sustain the bait fish known as the Delta smelt. This is a simple distribution issue; there is plenty of water.Prior to the statists taking over California, massive pumps were diverting water from rivers into the canal system (built before Brown and his ilk took control of the state). They have all but turned these pumps off to protect the fish from their Darwinian demise, and billions upon billions of gallons of fresh water is continuously dumped into the ocean.For the people-hating San Francisco cabal, cutting off water from the people is the real goal. They want fewer people to begin with, but the ultimate goal is control. Few environmentalists admit it publicly, but they want zero farming in the central valley, preferring to  allow  land to return to its prehistoric state. The cabal wants to control water so they can control people. Brown is just the messenger today. He is telling America that water access is a privilege, he has the power to pick winners and losers, and we have to just take it.If Brown decides tomorrow that he wants to withhold water from almond farmers, Americans will just have to accept it. Have you ever wondered why any business owner would give campaign donations to Marxist, business-hating politicians? Now you know why. They must give to buy protection. Business owners do not donate to Brown, Pelosi or Harry Reid because those politicians are good for business; they give to be sure they are not the next targets.The problem with all of this is that water is a limitless natural resource. Just ask the sailor who faced drowning daily or the people in the Midwest who were deluged this week. It is one thing to argue for conservation of animals, or even trees, or  green space,  but water? Water is a limitless natural resource. Not even the most self-important leftist believes he could make water go away, no matter how hard he tried. How did they convince us to accept this lie?They got us to buy the lie that water is scarce by telling it often enough and pounding it into generations of schoolchildren. Using federal law and acts of Congress, they forced people from water-soaked regions to accept low flush or what some call  two flush  toilets the same as desert-dwelling Californians. And we fell for it. At least the Democrats among us fell for it.Thus it is that Brown got to have his cake and eat it, too. He told Californians, and really all Americans and the world, that lack of water was not his fault for lacking the vision to feed the distribution system created by the real men who built California. He repeats that it is not the fault of the Marxists  Endangered Species Act that prefers hard-headed fish over people. The lack of water is the result of the lack of  snow pack,  which is the result of  climate change,  which is the result of greedy people being well, people. The Delta smelt and steelhead trout must live and we mere humans should all just die.Meanwhile, Jerry Brown is committed to spending $100 billion for trains, but he has made zero commitment to allowing water to flow to people instead of fish, and zero commitment to finding funding for his  twin tunnels  alternate solution. And why would he? We are cutting back our water use, ratting on our neighbors and accepting higher produce prices across America. The Marxists in San Francisco are toasting total victory. The farmers and country club board members are suing for peace. Lord help usVia: WND',\n",

Discussions are ongoing,  a French presidential source told reporters on Monday ahead of the visit.  You spoke about several dossiers for which the point of maturity is close, but I prefer to remain a little bit prudent and wait until Thursday.   Paris has close commercial and political ties with Qatar and has pushed further business interests in the country as well as encourage investment into France, where the gas-rich Gulf state already has assets of about $10 billion. It has also sought to play a role as a go-between in a row, which began in early June when Saudi Arabia, Bahrain, the United Arab Emirates and Egypt cut political and trade ties with Qatar. Since then Qatar has sought to strengthen its military, including signing military equipment deals with the United States, Russia and Britain. ($1 = 0.8441 euros) ',\n",

       " 'VIENNA (Reuters) - The United States would  badly  like to lift sanctions against Russia but will not do so until Moscow has pulled its forces out of eastern Ukraine and Crimea, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Thursday, calling that the main obstacle to normal ties. Tillerson is on a visit to Europe during which he has reassured allies with tougher rhetoric against Moscow than that of U.S. President Donald Trump, who has sought better relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Speaking at a meeting of the Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), also attended by his Russian counterpart, Tillerson said Moscow was to blame for increased violence in eastern Ukraine and that had to stop.  We ve made this clear to Russia from the very beginning, that we must address Ukraine,  Tillerson told a news conference with his Austrian counterpart Sebastian Kurz.  It stands as the single most difficult obstacle to us renormalizing the relationship with Russia, which we badly would like to do.  On Wednesday, Tillerson met NATO foreign ministers and criticized Russia for the mix of state-sponsored computer hacks and Internet disinformation campaigns that NATO allies  intelligence agencies say is targeted at the West. The conflict between Ukrainian forces and Russian-backed separatists in eastern Ukraine has claimed more than 10,000 lives since it erupted in 2014. Russia denies accusations that it fomented the conflict and provided arms and fighters. Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told the OSCE conference that  all the responsibility is with Ukraine  as far as violence in the east was concerned. In his speech to the gathering, Tillerson went even further in spelling out Russia s involvement in the conflict and the consequences it faced than he had the day before in Brussels.   We should be clear about the source of this violence,  Tillerson said, referring to increasing ceasefire violations recorded by OSCE monitors in eastern Ukraine.  Russia is arming, leading, training and fighting alongside anti-government forces. We call on Russia and its proxies to end its harassment, intimidation and its attacks on the OSCE Special Monitoring Mission.  While both sides have called for a U.N. peacekeeping force in eastern Ukraine, they disagree on the terms of its deployment, and there was little sign of concrete progress at Thursday s meeting.  We will continue to work with Russia to see if we could not agree a peacekeeping force that could enter Ukraine (and) reduce the violence,  Tillerson told the news conference. He and Lavrov met on the sidelines of the conference, though both ignored reporters  questions when the meeting began. Asked later what commitments he had received at the meeting, Tillerson said:  I m not going to tell you specifically what we get. We get progress, that s what we get. We get dialogue, we get cooperation, we don t have it solved. You don t solve it in one meeting.   In his speech, he referred to the 2015 Minsk ceasefire agreement, brokered in the Belarussian capital by France, Germany, Russia and Ukraine.  In eastern Ukraine, we join our European partners in maintaining sanctions until Russia withdraws its forces from the Donbass (region) and meets its Minsk commitments,  Tillerson said. He also made clear that Washington did not accept Russia s seizure of the Crimean Peninsula from Ukraine in 2014.  We will never accept Russia s occupation and attempted annexation of Crimea. Crimea-related sanctions will remain in place until Russia returns full control of the peninsula to Ukraine,  he said. ',\n",

Israel s military denied accounts by local residents that the militants were killed in an air strike. Violence along the Israel-Gaza border has flared since U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition last week of Jerusalem as Israel s capital and the Israeli military s demolition on Sunday of a cross-border tunnel it said was dug by Hamas, the Islamist group that controls the small coastal enclave. On Monday, Israel s Iron Dome anti-missile system intercepted a rocket fired by militants in Gaza. Shortly afterward, Israel responded with tank fire and air strikes targeting positions of Hamas.

       " 'This is how far Republicans will go to protect a racist in their party.Thirty years after Congress rejected Jeff Sessions  nomination as a federal judge, the Alabama Republican who only had a problem with the KKK because they smoked marijuana is once again up for a critical government post that could set voting rights back for generations.Donald Trump s nomination of Sessions as Attorney General has raised alarm bells across the nation as civil rights groups fear he will gut the Justice Department, particularly the division that investigates and fights voting rights and civil rights violations.As a federal attorney, Sessions slapped voter fraud charges against black volunteers in his home state who were tasked with picking up and delivering absentee ballots to the post office so they could be counted. Sessions lost the case, and no one was indicted because the volunteers did nothing wrong. Sessions just hates black people and sees their voting as a crime.Even former colleagues testified that Sessions is a racist.According to the New York Times,In testimony before the committee, former colleagues said that Mr. Sessions had referred to the N.A.A.C.P., the Southern Christian Leadership Conference and other civil rights groups as  un-American  and  Communist-inspired.  An African-American federal prosecutor then, Thomas H. Figures, said Mr. Sessions had referred to him as  boy  and testified that Mr. Sessions said the Ku Klux Klan was fine  until I found out they smoked pot. If you still need proof that Sessions is a racist, just consider that white supremacists cheered when Trump announced his nomination.But there is one piece of testimony that Republicans have been suppressing for decades that would be a nail in the coffin of Sessions  effort to become Attorney General.In 1986, Coretta Scott King, the widow of Martin Luther King, Jr., wrote a letter of testimony to the Republican-controlled Judiciary Committee that ended up rejecting Sessions.Buzzfeed reports that racist Senator Strom Thurmond refused to put the letter in the Congressional record and the contents have been kept from public view ever since. But Knight Rider reporter Aaron Epstein published a piece of it in 1986 that explains why we should not believe Sessions when he claims he isn t racist. For a century, the racial practices that characterized our region were established and enforced by men who, like Mr. Sessions, protested that they, too, were not personally hostile to blacks,  King wrote.And that line alone should disqualify Sessions from ever being more than a racist senator. Because the last thing this country needs is a racist Attorney General in charge of the very institution that investigates voter suppression, discrimination, and hate crimes against people of color.Featured Image: Wikimedia',\n",

Will justice finally be delivered to these corrupt, anti-American, self-serving and lying players? Not providing information on a corruption scheme before the Russian uranium deal was approved by U.S. regulators and engage appropriate congressional committees has served to undermine U.S. national security interests by the very people charged with protecting them. The Russian efforts to manipulate our American political enterprise is breathtaking.    Former House Intelligence Chair Mike Rogers (R-MI)The Hill   Before the Obama administration approved a controversial deal in 2010 giving Moscow control of a large swath of American uranium, the FBI had gathered substantial evidence that Russian nuclear industry officials were engaged in bribery, kickbacks, extortion and money laundering designed to grow Vladimir Putin s atomic energy business inside the United States, according to government documents and interviews.Federal agents used a confidential U.S. witness working inside the Russian nuclear industry to gather extensive financial records, make secret recordings and intercept emails as early as 2009 that showed Moscow had compromised an American uranium trucking firm with bribes and kickbacks in violation of the Foreign Corrupt Practices Act, FBI and court documents show.They also obtained an eyewitness account   backed by documents   indicating Russian nuclear officials had routed millions of dollars to the U.S. designed to benefit former President Bill Clinton s charitable foundation during the time Secretary of State Hillary Clinton served on a government body that provided a favorable decision to Moscow, sources told The Hill.The racketeering scheme was conducted  with the consent of higher level officials  in Russia who  shared the proceeds  from the kickbacks, one agent declared in an affidavit years later.Rather than bring immediate charges in 2010, however, the Department of Justice (DOJ) continued investigating the matter for nearly four more years, essentially leaving the American public and Congress in the dark about Russian nuclear corruption on U.S. soil during a period when the Obama administration made two major decisions benefitting Putin s commercial nuclear ambitions.The first decision occurred in October 2010, when the State Department and government agencies on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States unanimously approved the partial sale of Canadian mining company Uranium One to the Russian nuclear giant Rosatom, giving Moscow control of more than 20 percent of America s uranium supply.When this sale was used by Trump on the campaign trail last year, Hillary Clinton s spokesman said she was not involved in the committee review and noted the State Department official who handled it said she  never intervened   on any [Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States] matter. In 2011, the administration gave approval for Rosatom s Tenex subsidiary to sell commercial uranium to U.S. nuclear power plants in a partnership with the United States Enrichment Corp. Before then, Tenex had been limited to selling U.S. nuclear power plants reprocessed uranium recovered from dismantled Soviet nuclear weapons under the 1990s Megatons to Megawatts peace program. The Russians were compromising American contractors in the nuclear industry with kickbacks and extortion threats, all of which raised legitimate national security concerns. And none of that evidence got aired before the Obama administration made those decisions,  a person who worked on the case told The Hill, speaking on condition of anonymity for fear of retribution by U.S. or Russian officials.The Obama administration s decision to approve Rosatom s purchase of Uranium One has been a source of political controversy since 2015.That s when conservative author Peter Schweitzer and The New York Times documented how Bill Clinton collected hundreds of thousands of dollars in Russian speaking fees and his charitable foundation collected millions in donations from parties interested in the deal while Hillary Clinton presided on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States.The Obama administration and the Clintons defended their actions at the time, insisting there was no evidence that any Russians or donors engaged in wrongdoing and there was no national security reason for any member of the committee to oppose the Uranium One deal.But FBI, Energy Department and court documents reviewed by The Hill show the FBI, in fact, had gathered substantial evidence well before the committee s decision that Vadim Mikerin   the main Russian overseeing Putin s nuclear expansion inside the United States   was engaged in wrongdoing starting in 2009.Then-Attorney General Eric Holder was among the Obama administration officials joining Hillary Clinton on the Committee on Foreign Investment in the United States at the time the Uranium One deal was approved. Multiple current and former government officials told The Hill they did not know whether the FBI or DOJ ever alerted committee members to the criminal activity they uncovered.Spokesmen for Holder and Clinton did not return calls seeking comment. The Justice Department also didn t comment.Mikerin was a director of Rosatom s Tenex in Moscow since the early 2000s, where he oversaw Rosatom s nuclear collaboration with the United States under the Megatons to Megwatts program and its commercial uranium sales to other countries. In 2010, Mikerin was dispatched to the U.S. on a work visa approved by the Obama administration to open Rosatom s new American arm called Tenam.Between 2009 and January 2012, Mikerin  did knowingly and willfully combine, conspire confederate and agree with other persons   to obstruct, delay and affect commerce and the movement of an article and commodity (enriched uranium) in commerce by extortion,  a November 2014 indictment stated.His illegal conduct was captured with the help of a confidential witness, an American businessman, who began making kickback payments at Mikerin s direction and with the permission of the FBI. The first kickback payment recorded by the FBI through its informant was dated Nov. 27, 2009, the records show. The investigation was ultimately supervised by then-U.S. Attorney Rod Rosenstein, an Obama appointee who now serves as President Trump s deputy attorney general, and then-Assistant FBI Director Andrew McCabe, now the deputy FBI director under Trump, Justice Department documents show.On August 6, 2017,  The Washington Times questioned Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein s  fishing expedition  aimed at digging up dirt on President Trump in his investigation in the Trump-Russia investigation. The special counsel is subject to the rules and regulations of the Department of Justice, and we don t engage in fishing expeditions,  Mr. Rosenstein said on  Fox News Sunday. In his first Sunday show interview, Mr. Rosenstein added that special counsel Robert Mueller  understands and I understand the specific scope of the investigation and so, it s not a fishing expedition. Mr. Rosenstein s comments come amid reports citing unnamed sources that the investigation has expanded into Mr. Trump s finances unrelated to possible Russian interference in last year s election.Mr. Rosenstein played down the reports:  That s not anything that I ve said. That s not anything Director Mueller has said. We don t know who s saying it or how credible those sources are. Both men now play a key role in the current investigation into possible, but still unproven collusion between Russia and Donald Trump s campaign during the 2016 election.McCabe is under congressional and Justice Department inspector general investigation in connection with money his wife s Virginia state Senate campaign accepted in 2015 from now-Virginia Gov. Terry McAuliffe at a time when McAuliffe was reportedly under investigation by the FBI.The connections to the current Russia case are many. The Mikerin probe began in 2009 when Robert Mueller, now the special counsel in charge of the Trump case, was still FBI director. And it ended in late 2015 under the direction of then-FBI Director James Comey, who Trump fired earlier this year.Bringing down a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme that had both compromised a sensitive uranium transportation asset inside the U.S. and facilitated international money laundering would seem a major feather in any law enforcement agency s cap.But the Justice Department and FBI took little credit in 2014 when Mikerin, the Russian financier and the trucking firm executives were arrested and charged.The only public statement occurred an entire year later when the Justice Department put out a little-noticed press release in August 2015, just days before Labor Day. The release noted that the various defendants had reached plea deals.The lack of fanfare left many key players in Washington with no inkling that a major Russian nuclear corruption scheme with serious national security implications had been uncovered.On Dec. 15, 2015, the Justice Department put out a release stating that Mikerin,  a former Russian official residing in Maryland was sentenced today to 48 months in prison  and ordered to forfeit more than $2.1 million.Ronald Hosko, who served as the assistant FBI director in charge of criminal cases when the investigation was underway, told The Hill he did not recall ever being briefed about Mikerin s case by the counterintelligence side of the bureau despite the criminal charges that were being lodged. I had no idea this case was being conducted,  a surprised Hosko said in an interview.Meanwhile, Julian Assange is jumping on the bandwagon, as he teases that he has a major announcement of his own that is coming soon Russian nuclear bribery investigation reveals that Russia routed millions to the Clintons https://t.co/ti7ycn7auf  Julian Assange   (@JulianAssange) October 17, 2017\",\n",
       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - The United States must keep military options on the table when dealing with North Korea, but it does not want to use them unless it has to, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan said during a visit to Britain on Wednesday. U.S. President Donald Trump has taken a hard line with North Korean leader Kim Jong Un, who has rebuffed admonitions from China and proceeded with nuclear and missile programmes seen by Washington and others as a direct threat. “Allowing this dictator to have that kind of power is not something that civilized nations can allow to happen ... of course we don’t want to have military options employed, but we must keep all options on the table,” he said when asked if the U.S. administration would be willing to drop bombs on North Korea. Ryan said he was encouraged by the results of efforts to work with China to reduce tensions, but that it was unacceptable North Korea might be able to strike allies with nuclear weapons. In a wide ranging question and answer session at an event organized by the policy Exchange think tank, Ryan also said he wanted to “ratchet up” sanctions on Iran but believed a nuclear deal struck in 2015, and previously criticized by Trump, would remain in place. “There are lots of things that Iran is doing outside of this deal: proliferation of terrorism, weapons, violating missile tests - those things we should apply sanctions to,” he said. The Trump administration said on Tuesday it was launching an inter-agency review of whether the lifting of sanctions against Iran was in the United States’ national security interests, while acknowledging that Tehran was complying with a deal to rein in its nuclear program. Ryan was visiting Britain with a cross-party delegation of lawmakers as part of a trip to reassure European allies of U.S. commitment to the NATO military alliance.  He used his remarks to call on countries to meet the alliance’s minimum defense spending requirement, and also singled out the international threat posed by Russia. “Russia is determined to exploit weakness and opportunity wherever it may surface,” he said, citing Moscow’s involvement in supporting Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. “As they expand, and seek to expand their sphere of influence, they are continuing to challenge the sovereignty of all our allies in eastern and central Europe.” He repeated U.S. concerns, denied by Moscow, that Russia had interfered in its 2016 election and said Russia was currently interfering in elections in Europe. He gave no further details. “We’ve learned a thing or two about their tactics in America and we commit to sharing those lessons learned with our allies so that you can be better prepared,” he said.

       " 'BUENOS AIRES (Reuters) - Argentina s top prosecutor quit on Monday under pressure from the government over accusations that she hampered corruption investigations into officials from the previous administration of President Cristina Fernandez.  Alejandra Gils Carbo, whose resignation will take effect on Dec. 31, was appointed chief prosecutor during populist Fernandez s second term and stayed in the post under business-oriented President Mauricio Macri. Macri, in office since late 2015, accused Gils Carbo of failing to bring corruption charges against members of Fernandez s cabinet. Gils Carbo is herself the focus of a corruption investigation cantering on her tenure as lead prosecutor. She has denied corruption allegations. At a press conference in July, Macri described Gils Carbo as a  political activist  who misused her power as attorney general.  After repeatedly calling for her resignation, Macri s government began a campaign for reforms that would allow for Gils Carbo s firing, which ultimately prompted her to step down. In her resignation letter, Gils Carbo told Macri she was concerned that his actions would end up hurting state institutions by  significantly affecting the autonomy of the public prosecutor s office.  Gils Carbo resigned one week after a powerful minister from the Fernandez era was arrested following a vote in Congress that stripped him of his parliamentary immunity in two corruption cases. The former minister, Julio De Vido, is the most powerful official from the Fernandez administration to be jailed. Macri s coalition was empowered by midterm elections on Oct. 22, and he has pledged more reforms. ',\n",

       " 'NAIROBI (Reuters) - Kenya s opposition leader Raila Odinga said on Tuesday he wants an interim government to run the country for six months while the constitution is reviewed to curb the president s authority. Odinga told Reuters in an interview that he was open to talks with President Uhuru Kenyatta over a constitutional review aimed at lowering the risk of violence from minority groups who feel excluded from power.  Kenyatta was re-elected with 98 percent of the vote on Oct. 26 after Odinga boycotted the election, saying it would not be fair. The repeat presidential vote followed an election in August, which Kenyatta also won but which was nullified by the Supreme Court on procedural grounds.  Odinga s supporters have repeatedly protested against the results, and at least 51 people have been killed in the turmoil since August, generating an atmosphere of uncertainty in East Africa s richest economy.   A pure presidential system enhances ethnicity because each community believes that they are not safe unless their man is at the top,  Odinga said in the interview in his office.  Three of Kenya s presidents since independence from Britain in 1963 have been from the Kikuyu ethnic group and one has been from the Kalenjin group, although there are 44 recognized ethnic groups in the nation.  The current president is a Kikuyu and his deputy is a Kalenjin, and many of Odinga s supporters, who are largely drawn from other ethnic groups, say they feel excluded from power.  The 2010 constitution devolved some power and money to Kenya s 47 counties, spreading the opportunities for power and political patronage. But most of the budget and the power is still in the hands of the central government, something Odinga wants to change.   We had a new constitution that we enacted in 2010; we think that now it is time to revisit it,  he said.  A constitutional review could strengthen institutions like the election board and cut down the powers of the presidency, he said.  We think that maybe six months will be required to carry out all these changes that we need in this country.  Odinga served as prime minister in a coalition government that was crafted in 2008 after two months of violence following a disputed election killed 1,200 people. After the Oct. 26 election, Odinga s opposition alliance called for civil disobedience, including protests and a boycott of products and services by firms friendly to Kenyatta s government, to force reforms.  The opposition did not challenge Kenyatta s Oct. 26 victory at the Supreme Court and there has been no protest action, but voter and rights activists lodged cases on Monday. The court has 14 days to review them.  ',\n",
       " 'JAKARTA (Reuters) - Indonesian President Joko Widodo has nominated the chief of staff of the air force to be the new head of the armed forces (TNI), to replace a controversial general who is due to retire in April. Air Chief Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto has close ties to the president and was previously in charge of an air base in the city of Solo, on the island of Java, when Widodo was its mayor. Since then, Tjahjanto has been promoted a number of times including to inspector general of the defense ministry and the president s military secretary.  Marshal Hadi Tjahjanto is considered capable and qualified to become TNI commander,  presidential spokesman Johan Budi told reporters on Monday after confirming the nomination. The proposal had been sent to the parliament, which needs to approve it, he said. Abdul Kharis Almasyhari, chairman of a parliamentary commission with oversight of defense and security, said the commission would do a  fit and proper  assessment of the nomination, which hopefully could be completed by a Dec. 14  recess. The outgoing armed forces chef, General Gatot Nurmantyo, who will step down at the end of his term in April, has often courted controversy over what analysts see as his political ambitions.  He has been accused of whipping up nationalist sentiment by promoting the notion that Indonesia is besieged by  proxy wars  waged by foreign states looking to undermine it. In October, Widodo said the armed forces should stay out of politics and ensure their loyalty was only to the state and the government - a statement many believed referred to Nurmantyo s actions. There has been speculation that Nurmantyo would seek to run for vice president or even president in 2019. Nurmantyo has not confirmed any political ambitions. He told a briefing in October the military was  neutral in practical politics . ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump may tap U.S. Energy Secretary Rick Perry to replace former Homeland Security Secretary John Kelly, who took over as White House chief of staff this week, Bloomberg News reported on Wednesday. Bloomberg, citing three people familiar with deliberations, said others were also being considered for the post. White House officials had no immediate comment. Asked about the Bloomberg report, an Energy Department spokeswoman said Perry was content in his current job. “While Secretary Perry is honored to be mentioned, he is happy where he is and very focused on carrying out the mission the President gave him when he was chosen to lead the Department of Energy,” Shaylyn Hynes said in an email. On Friday, an official at the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) said Republican U.S. Representative Michael McCaul, who chairs the House Homeland Security Committee, was among those being considered to replace Kelly.  The department is currently being run by Homeland Security Deputy Secretary Elaine Duke. On Friday, Trump replaced his beleaguered White House chief of staff, Reince Priebus, after only six months on the job, installing Kelly, a retired four-star Marine Corps general, in his place in a major shake-up of his top team.   Hired to bring more discipline to the White House, Kelly took up his new post on Monday. Kelly’s tenure at DHS was marked by a drop in attempted southern border crossings and a crackdown on illegal immigrants with criminal records, with a focus on gangs.  ',\n",

       " 'Even Fox News understands that the Republican healthcare bill will leave millions of Americans in financial ruins.That s why Chris Wallace put the screws to House Speaker Paul Ryan on Sunday.So far, the GOP healthcare bill has been universally panned and Republicans who still support the bill are struggling to defend it.The bill will not only strip health insurance from tens of millions of Americans, it will make the cost of healthcare skyrocket, especially among senior citizens whose costs are projected to be ten times what they pay now under the Affordable Care Act.During an interview on Fox News Sunday, Wallace pointed out to Ryan that the GOP healthcare bill would force senior citizens with an annual income of $26,500 to spend $14,600 a year on health insurance instead of the $1,700 they currently spend thanks to subsidies provided by the Affordable Care Act.Wallace then slammed Ryan for saying that the GOP plan is  what freedom looks like,  even though seniors would be forced to spend over half of their income on healthcare. That s definitely NOT freedom. You said that part of that is that this is what freedom looks like,  Wallace began.  But is the major decrease in the number of people   according to the CBO   who will have health insurance, is it freedom or is it that some people will no longer be able to afford health insurance under your plan? This isn t freedom,  Wallace continued.  This isn t people voluntarily deciding not to have health insurance. It s that your plan makes it unaffordable for people. Ryan responded by going on an incoherent rant about how the Affordable Acre Act is  not going to last,  even though Republican sabotage is the reason why the Affordable Care Act is having problems in the first place. And then he started talking about how the GOP bill will make insurance plans less expensive even though Wallace just got done telling him the exact opposite. We re not going to make people buy something that s so expensive that they can t afford, that the market is not going to offer,  Ryan said.  And so where I dispute that comparison is it suggests that we re going to have the same kinds of plans being offered in 10 years that Obamacare would otherwise offer. The person in their 50s or 60s does have additional health care costs than, say, a person in their 20s and 30s You re right in saying   and we agree   we believe we should have even more assistance and that s one of the things we re looking at for that person in their 50s and 60s. We re going to let people buy what they want to buy,  Ryan continued.  We re going to have more plans being offered, more choice and competition. He also claimed that gutting healthcare regulations would cause prices to drop.Here s the video via YouTube:Ryan s argument in defense of Trumpcare is that the CBO didn t examine everything. The problem is that if they had the GOP plan would have looked even worse.Getting rid of regulations won t make healthcare more affordable. It just gives insurance companies more freedom to screw over their customers.As the GOP healthcare bill currently stands, senior citizens will end up paying ten times as much for healthcare than they do now.The Affordable Care Act created competition among health insurance companies and slowed down the rising cost of premiums while covering tens of millions of Americans who previously could not afford coverage.The GOP bill repeals all of that and Ryan s defense was not only confusing, it was full of empty promises in a desperate effort to convince the American people that Republicans care about them.Featured image via screenshot',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Democratic leader Chuck Schumer on Monday said lawmakers from his party  insist  Puerto Rico be included in any supplemental federal disaster relief packages for hurricanes Harvey and Irma.  Hurricane Maria slammed Puerto Rico last week, tearing apart buildings and infrastructure, flooding communities and downing communications to nearly all of the U.S. territory s 3.4 million residents.   Puerto Rico has taken a serious punch to the gut,  Schumer said during his opening remarks on the Senate floor.  They need our help they, need it now.  Schumer also urged his constituents to add the U.S. Virgin Islands, which were ravaged by Hurricane Irma several weeks ago, and western U.S. states ravaged by wildfires to future hurricane-related federal relief packages. He asked for additional aid packages to be prepared quickly.

       " 'NAJAF, Iraq (Reuters) - In early September, Ayatollah Mahmoud Hashemi Shahroudi, a senior Iranian official and cleric, flew to the holy city of Najaf in southern Iraq. His entourage included a sizable security detail and the former head of the Revolutionary Guards, the most powerful military force in the Islamic Republic. Shahroudi, 69, spent several days on a charm offensive meeting officials, clerics and seminary students at his office near the golden dome shrine of Imam Ali, one of the world s holiest Shi ite sites. His aim was to raise his profile as a replacement for the top Shi ite cleric and most powerful man in Iraq: the 87-year old Ayatollah Ali Sistani, according to current and former Iraqi officials. While attention has focused on Iraq s battle against Islamic State, the country s future could equally hinge on what is happening in Najaf. With Sistani s advanced age and persistent rumors about his health, the question of his replacement has become more pointed. Iraqi Shi ite factions are jockeying to influence who replaces Sistani. Iran, whose population is mostly Shi ite, backs Shahroudi. Shahroudi could prove a controversial replacement for Sistani. Senior clergy in Najaf are wary of Iran trying to expand its influence and Shahroudi is viewed with some suspicion, although he could still build support among students. Since Sistani has distanced himself from Iranian politics some of his followers may not want a replacement who is close to Tehran. Sources in Najaf were unwilling to go on the record on a matter as sensitive as Sistani s successor, but a former senior Iraqi official told Reuters:  The Iranians will try their best.   It s not just religious, politics have become part of it. It will decide the fate of Iraq,  the official said. Iran has already expanded its influence in Iraq by helping the Shi ite-led government in Baghdad retake disputed areas from the Kurds. The head of the branch of the Revolutionary Guards responsible for operations outside Iran, Qassem Soleimani, personally convinced some Kurdish leaders to abandon their claim to contested towns, like the oil-rich Kirkuk. Attempts to reach Shahroudi and the Revolutionary Guards media office were unsuccessful, as were attempts to reach Sistani s office for comment. If Iran can influence who becomes the next top Shi ite cleric in Iraq, it could tighten its grip on power within the country for years. A senior cleric in Najaf who is sympathetic to the interests of Iran would also eliminate a rival to Iranian Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei, who claims to be the leader of Shi ite Muslims worldwide. For years, Sistani, who has endorsed a religious and political viewpoint independent of Iran, has been Khamenei s top challenger for the leadership of the global Shi ite community. Sistani is rarely seen in public but his decrees are sacrosanct to his millions of Shi ite followers. Sistani s fatwa to rise up against the Sunni militants of Islamic State thwarted the group s push toward Baghdad in 2014. The cleric has also used his decrees to reduce sectarian violence in the country. Sistani opposed the secession of the Kurdish region after the referendum on independence in September but then urged Baghdad to protect Kurds after reports of abuses surfaced last month. Without Sistani s restraining influence, clashes are likely to break out between sects as well as among rival Shi ite groups, Iraqi officials and observers say.  Sistani is not just a poor guy sitting in a house. He can control millions of people,  the Iraqi former senior official said.  It will be a very bloody struggle after Sistani passes away.  Sources in Najaf expect Sistani to remain in his post until his death. There is no clear succession process, but Shahroudi would need to obtain the support of a large number of ordinary Shi ites, seminary students and other clerics. Shahroudi is no stranger to Najaf: he was born in the city to Iranian parents. In the 1970s he was jailed and tortured by Saddam Hussein s security forces because of his political activities. He moved to Iran after the Islamic revolution and has been promoted to top posts since Khamenei became supreme leader in 1989. Shahroudi was head of the Iranian judiciary for a decade and is currently the head of the Expediency Council, a body intended to resolve disputes between parliament and a hardline watchdog body, the Guardian Council. In public, Shahroudi is often seen sitting next to Khamenei. Shahroudi s visit is only one sign of how Tehran is trying to rally support for its candidate to replace Sistani. A company linked to the Revolutionary Guards is involved in a $300 million project to expand the Imam Ali shrine, making it the second largest Muslim holy site after Mecca in Saudi Arabia.  These projects create a state of dependency between recipients of aid and Tehran since they integrate the Iraqi infrastructure into the Iranian infrastructure network,  said Ali Alfoneh, an expert on the Guards at the Atlantic Council.  Furthermore, such activities provide a cover for the Islamic Republic s intelligence networks operating in Iraq.  In 2011, Shahroudi opened an office in Najaf and began paying clerical students stipends, which observers say was an attempt by Iran to increase its influence.  It was a provocative move,  said an Iraqi analyst familiar with the Shi ite clergy who asked not to be identified. Shahroudi subsequently opened offices in Baghdad and Karbala. He pays stipends to thousands of seminary students, according to Iraqi officials and clerical sources in Najaf.  Clerics often pay stipends to students to gather support, raise their profile and perhaps become accepted as a marja, or top cleric, observers say.  Iran is trying to influence the process of who comes after Sistani through the students,  said a Western diplomat in Iraq who did not have permission to speak on the record. Sistani is now the main sponsor of Shi ite clerical students, paying millions of dollars in Iraq and elsewhere. His son Mohammed Ridha oversees the financial and administrative work of his office.  Follow the dollars to see what will happen next,  said an Iraqi senior official familiar with the clerical politics of Najaf.  Mohammed Ridha Sistani controls all the cash.  Mohammed Ridha s work could position him to replace his father, observers say, though passing the religious mantle within a family would be unprecedented in Shi ite custom. Top contenders to replace Sistani in Najaf include three other marjas but they are old and there is no clear front-runner, according to clerical sources and Iraqi officials.  Nothing is fixed to make a decision for this procedure,  said Sheikh Ali Najafi, son of one of the top Najaf marjas.  While in Iraq, Shahroudi visited prime minister Haidar al Abadi in Baghdad. Iraqi officials said Sistani refused to see him in Najaf, but they do not expect the Iranians to give up. ',\n",
       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - The North Korean nuclear issue needs a peaceful resolution, Chinese President Xi Jinping told U.S. President Donald Trump in a telephone call on Saturday, and called on the “relevant side” to exercise restraint, state television said. Trump issued a new threat to North Korea on Friday, saying the U.S. military was “locked and loaded”, as Pyongyang accused him of driving the Korean peninsula to the brink of nuclear war and world powers expressed alarm. Xi told Trump that it was in the joint interests of both China and the United States to achieve the denuclearisation of the Korean peninsula and protect peace and stability there, state television said in a brief report. “The relevant side must at present exercise restraint, and avoid words and actions that exacerbate tensions on the Korean peninsula,” the report paraphrased Xi as saying. Resolving the nuclear issue ultimately needs to be done politically via talks, and China is willing to maintain communication with the United States on the basis of mutual respect to push for an appropriate resolution, Xi added. Chinese state television cited Trump as telling Xi that he fully understands the role China has been playing on the North Korean nuclear issue. ',\n",
       " 'While having a third independent option for president is surely a democratic thing to do, the implications surrounding someone like former New York City Mayor Mike Bloomberg jumping into the race are huge.What would Bloomberg running as an independent on the ticket mean? Well, it would pull votes from a major party candidate, and in this election, that candidate will be the Democratic one. Because while Bloomberg could appeal to wealthy conservatives, he s staunchly pro-heavy gun regulations, which will turn the remainder of the Republican base off in a heart beat. So, any votes he pulls will be from moderate to right-leaning Democrats, as well as independents who may be leaning towards the Democratic candidate. This is especially true if Bernie Sanders is the nominee and people are apprehensive about a Democratic Socialist in the White House. However, it d be true of Hillary Clinton as well.So with the center votes missing from the Democratic candidate, and surely not enough votes for Bloomberg taken from either side, this leaves the Republicans with a clear path to victory, and with Donald Trump trouncing his opposition in the polls, we re looking at a Trump presidency.Now, unless Bloomberg has some secret, backdoor deal with Trump that no one is keenly aware of, the former mayor of New York City needs to put his dreams of the Oval Office on the shelf, and likely keep them there for good. The last thing this nation needs is a President Trump. A person, who as president, would alienate not only all the minorities in his own country, but would alienate the United States from the rest of the world. We d be an embarrassment. Even more so than when George W. Bush was president.So, please, Bloomberg, if you happen to read this, take all that was just said to heart and think about what you really, truly want for the nation. If you want President Trump, then by all means, run. However, if not, please don t. Not just for you and the nation, but for the entire world.Featured image: Flickr/Flickr',\n",
       " 'The reason the State Department is hiding payments to the 9 agencies that resettle refugees is because it s so much money. They know if you know how much money is spent that Americans will be even more outraged by the thousands of mostly muslim refugees being shipped in quietly to America.If you re not familiar with the refugee resettlement scam that costs BILLIONS, the information below  from Judicial Watch will shock you. The information is being hidden/redacted by the State Department because they don t want Americans to know what they give to the 9 resettlement agencies per year. It s mind blowing! Here s just one example: The State Department paid a VOLAG called United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) a ghastly $22,838,173 in one year to resettle refugees that came mostly from Muslim countries. Please listen to Ann Corcoran in the video below:State Dept. Hides Big Chunks of $22.8 Mil Contract to Resettle Muslim RefugeesThe U.S. government spends billions of dollars to  resettle  foreign nationals and transparency on how the money is spent depends on the agency involved. Judicial Watch has been investigating it for years, specifically the huge amount of taxpayer dollars that go to  voluntary agencies , known as VOLAGs, to provide a wide range of services for the new arrivals. Throughout the ongoing probe Judicial Watch has found a striking difference on how government lawyers use an exemption, officially known as (b)(4), to the Freedom of Information Act (FOIA) to withhold records. All the cases involve public funds being used to resettle foreigners on U.S. soil and Americans should be entitled to the records.The (b)(4) exemption permits agencies to withhold trade secrets and commercial or financial information obtained from a person which is privileged or confidential. Depending on the government agency and the mood of the taxpayer-funded lawyers handling public records requests, that information is exempt from disclosure. In these cases, the Department of Health and Human Services (HHS) disclosed a VOLAG contract to resettle tens of thousands of Unaccompanied Alien Children (UAC) that entered the U.S. through Mexico under the Obama administration while the State Department withheld large portions of a one-year, $22.8 million deal to resettle refugees from Muslim countries. Most of the UACs came from El Salvador, Honduras and Guatemala and the Obama administration blamed the sudden surge on violence in the three central American nations. The agency responsible for resettling the minors and issuing contracts for the costly services is HHS.As a result of Judicial Watch s work HHS furnished records with virtually nothing redacted. Disclosed were employee salaries of VOLAGs contracted by the agency to provide services for the illegal immigrant minors, the cost of laptops, big screen TVs, food, pregnancy tests,  multicultural crayons  and shower stalls for the new arrivals. The general contract was to provide  basic shelter care  for 2,400 minors for a period of four months in 2014. This cost American taxpayers an astounding $182,129,786 and the VOLAG contracted to do it was government regular called Baptist Children and Family Services (BCFS). The breakdown includes charges of $104,215,608 for UACs at Fort Sill, Oklahoma and an additional $77,914,178 for UACs at Lackland Air Force Base in San Antonio, Texas.HHS rightfully provided all sorts of details in the records, including the cost of emergency surge beds ($104,215,608) for just four months; food for the illegal alien minors and staff ($18,198,000); medical supplies such as first aid kits, latex gloves, lice shampoo and pregnancy tests ($1,120,400); recreation items such as board games, soccer balls and jump ropes ($180,000); educational items like art paper and multicultural crayons ($180,000); laptops ($200,000) and cellphones ($160,000). Hotel accommodations for the BCFS staff was $6,765,000, the records show, and the salary for a 30-member  Incident Management Team  was $2,648,800, which breaks down to $88,293 per IMT member for the four-month period. It was outrageous that the Obama administration spent nearly $200 million of taxpayer funds to provide illegal alien children with the types of extravagant high-tech equipment and lavish benefits many American families cannot even afford for their own children.This has become a heated issue for the government which may explain why other agencies aren t as forthcoming in providing specific figures, thus abusing the (b)(4) exemption. The State Department, for instance, redacted huge portions of records involving contracts with VOLAGs to resettle refugees from mostly Muslim countries. The files illustrate the disparate redaction treatment given by different government agencies to the same types of records. The State Department paid a VOLAG called United States Conference of Catholic Bishops (USCCB) a ghastly $22,838,173 in one year to resettle refugees that came mostly from Muslim countries. Unlike HHS, the agency redacted information related to what the USCCB charged the government for things like furniture, personnel, equipment and other costs associated with contracts to resettle refugees. Why did one government agency hand over the same types of records that another agency claims are trade secrets? Judicial Watch is challenging the State Department s (b)(4) exemption and will provide updates as they become available.HHS and the State Department work with nine VOLAGs to resettle refugees and the voluntary agencies have hundreds of contractors they like to call  affiliates.  It s a huge racket that costs American taxpayers monstrous sums and Judicial Watch is working to pinpoint the exact amount. Besides BCFS and USCCB, other VOLAGs with lucrative government gigs to resettle refugees are: Church World Service, Ethiopian Community Development Council, Episcopal Migration Ministries, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society, International Rescue Committee, U.S. Committee for Refugees and Immigrants, Lutheran Immigration Refugee Services and World Relief Corporation.Via: Judicial Watch',\n",
       " 'HARARE (Reuters) - A U.S. citizen was charged on Friday with attempting to overthrow the Zimbabwean government, which carries a sentence of up to 20 years in jail, after police earlier accused her of insulting 93-year-old President Robert Mugabe. Martha O Donovan, who works for Magamba TV, which describes itself as Zimbabwe s leading producer of political satire, was picked up in a dawn raid on her Harare home, her lawyer said. O Donovan, who denies both charges, was expected in court on Saturday, lawyer Obey Shava said. Police spokeswoman Charity Charamba could not be reached for comment on the new, much more serious, charge.  O Donovan was first charged with insulting and undermining the president, according to a police charge sheet, which accused her of last month calling Mugabe a  selfish and sick man  on Twitter, the first such arrest since the creation of a Ministry of Cyber Security last month.  That charge carries a maximum sentence of one year in jail, her lawyer said. Shava said police then accused O Donovan of setting up Magamba, being behind a  shadowy Twitter character  called @matigary and setting up another Twitter account @OpenParlyZw  for the sole purpose of overthrowing the government through unconstitutional means . The government has been particularly uneasy about social media after activists such as pastor Evan Mawararire and his #ThisFlag movement last year used social media to organize a stay-at-home demonstration, the biggest anti-government protest in a decade. A national election is due in 2018. The police search warrant showed that central to its investigation was a post on O Donovan s Twitter feed referring to a  Goblin  whose wife and step-sons had imported a Rolls-Royce, an apparent reference to Mugabe, though he was not named. In a statement to police seen by Reuters, O Donovan said:  I deny the allegations being leveled against me as baseless and malicious. That is all I wish to say.  The U.S. embassy in Harare confirmed an American citizen had been arrested and said it was monitoring the situation closely. Shava said his client had refused to sign a new document known as a  warned and cautioned statement  with the fresh charge. The document sets out the government s case and signing it signals a suspect understands the charge.  She had signed the statement on the lesser charge. Police seized her computers, cellphones and other electronic devices in the raid on her home. ',\n",

Now the black community has to also know that they have issues they need to deal with. This isn t a one-way street here. This is where it all went downhill. Huock rattled off the following stats: In New York City alone, blacks are 23% [of the population]; they make up 75% of all shootings, 70% of all robberies, 60% of all violent crimes. White only 3%. That is why there are more blacks in jail than there are whites. Hill fired back, denouncing that those numbers were the result of  a system that s dysfunctional . As Hill tried to convince Houck that the power should be given to citizens rather than law enforcement, tensions erupted when Houck made the inference of black criminality. Hill called Houck out for his racist comment and shouted: You think black people are prone to criminality!? You didn t mean to say that. I m gonna give you a chance to correct yourself! When Houck referred back to his statistics, Hill shot him down again and said, Harry, Googling some numbers is different than talking to me! The shouting match between the two continued, and Banks waited until the shouting had died down a bit to suggest more of a middle ground in working toward solutions. Banks said: It doesn t mean there aren t a lot of good cops. It doesn t mean that law enforcement doesn t serve communities through. It means that changes have to be made, talks need to be stopped, and action needs to take place. You can watch Houck derail the segment below:Featured image is a screenshot',\n",

A state that has developed a pretty good ICBM (missile) capability and is developing a pretty good nuclear re-entry vehicle, I would believe ... that that state simply cannot have the ability to reach the homeland,  Kelly said.

       " 'Khizr Khan, whose son was killed in Iraq while serving in the United States Military, took the stage at the Democratic National Convention and blasted Donald Trump. Beside him, his wife stood quietly while he asked if the Republican nominee had ever read the Constitution and then offered to lend him his copy. So naturally, Trump decided to attack her silence, insisting she held her tongue because she was MuslimGhazala Khan wrote a scathing response to the billionaire bully that was published in Sunday s edition of the Washington Post.Donald Trump has asked why I did not speak at the Democratic convention. He said he would like to hear from me. Here is my answer to Donald Trump: Because without saying a thing, all the world, all America, felt my pain. I am a Gold Star mother. Whoever saw me felt me in their heart.She wrote of how much her son, Humayun Khan, loved his country and how brave he was. She told of how, like every soldier s mother, she worried for his safety. She said that as he got on the plane for his deployment, he gave her strength. Don t worry, Mom. Everything will be all right,  he had told her.Mother s Day 2004 was the last time Ghazala got to speak with her son. She had begged him to be safe and he told her, Mom, these are my soldiers, these are my people. I have to take care of them.  He was taking care of his men when he died. He went to investigate a suspicious vehicle and was killed by a car bomb, but only after telling his everyone else to stay back and take cover.She said that her son always wanted to help people, something he did by volunteering to teach swim classes for people with disabilities at a local hospital. She added that he had wanted to follow in his father s footsteps and become a lawyer. To this day, Ghazala said she is unable to walk into a room with pictures of the middle son she lost. Walking onto the convention stage, with a huge picture of my son behind me, I could hardly control myself,  she wrote.  What mother could? Donald Trump has children whom he loves. Does he really need to wonder why I did not speak? Ghazala then spoke directly to the Republican nominee as she concluded.Donald Trump said that maybe I wasn t allowed to say anything. That is not true. My husband asked me if I wanted to speak, but I told him I could not. My religion teaches me that all human beings are equal in God s eyes. Husband and wife are part of each other; you should love and respect each other so you can take care of the family.Donald Trump said he has made a lot of sacrifices. He doesn t know what the word sacrifice means.Something tells me that Trump wishes he hadn t antagonized Ghazala to the point she felt the need to respond. It surely didn t turn out very well for him.Featured image via Alex Wong/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'Trump s threatening of the press seems to be paying dividends already, with at least one publication removing a quote that could be seen as  embarrassing,  for Trump   the Washington Post.On Tuesday, Buzzfeed reported that a quote was removed from Washington Post columnist Richard Cohen column published that morning   and it s a prett important one. The publication reports:Trump was reportedly referring to his daughter, Ivanka, who was 13 years old at the time.The quote was circulated Monday in a draft of Cohen s piece  Our Next President, The Godfather  that was sent to outlets that syndicate the column, a source told BuzzFeed News. The quote did not appear in the later, final version of the piece carried by the Post and other outlets.Cohen s column details the president-elect s increasingly blurred familial and political ties as he prepares to enter the White House.The reporting appeared in an advance version of the column that was circulated on Monday for publication on Tuesday and thereafter. It appeared as an aside after the introduction of Jared Kushner, which still appears in the final column:Jared Kushner, our Tom Hagen, who married Trump s stunning daughter Ivanka    Can I ask you something?  Trump asked someone I know, about his then-13-year-old kid,  Is it wrong to be more sexually attracted to your own daughter than your wife?    has lately lost some of this Boy Scout aura. It turns out Kushner s admission to Harvard was preceded by his father s $2.5 million pledge.However, the words between the hyphens   you know, the ones that reveal what a scumbag our next President is   were quietly removed from the final version. The Washington Post offered Buzzfeed a suspiciously dodgy excuse for the removal (hint: it wasn t that the quote was fake). We (or the Washington Post Writers Group, our affiliated syndicate) edit every column to try to make it as good as it can be, editorial page editor Fred Hiatt said. We don t think it would be fair to our writers to discuss the editing process, and don t see what is to be gained by talking about things that are not published there are countless drafts that never see the light of day,  Hiatt added, still not explaining why it was removed.On Monday, Trump gathered major media heads together in one room so he could scream at them and call them liars   Lugenpresse, to use his supporters  term. The removal of this damning quote seems to be a reaction to the President-elect s bullying of the press and yet another example of the media failing to hold The Donald accountable for anything he does or says.It might seem unbelievable that Trump would say such a thing about his daughter, but we re dealing with a man who has been talking about having sex with her since around the time he met Paris Hilton and thought she was hot (Hilton was 12 at the time).Recently, after Trump appeared on  Dr. Oz,  the show cut out a remark about kissing Ivanka  as often as possible. He has also been photographed in numerous suggestive poses with his daughter (including a prizewinning one of the two of them in bed together), when she was around 13 years old. He also has made it very clear that the two of them have  sex  in common (there is video of that), was caught on tape hitting on a 10-year-old  and, of course, who can forget that time he groped Ivanka on national television (at least she was an adult in this case). Then, of course, there is the fact that he is accused of raping a 13-year-old girl (his accuser abruptly dropped the lawsuit after Trump s supporters threatened her).We may never know why the Washington Post removed this latest horrific quote about Trump s daughter, but one thing is for certain: it was just a grain of sand on a beach of horribleness.Featured image via If You Only News/Getty Images (archive)',\n",

       " 'STOCKHOLM (Reuters) - Swedish prosecutors accused Democratic Republic of Congo s government on Wednesday of not cooperating with their investigation into the murder of a U.N. sanctions monitor from Sweden. Zaida Catalan and her American colleague, Michael Sharp, were shot dead in March and found in a shallow grave in an area of central Congo where they had been gathering information on a conflict between the army and a militia. Congo s government has arrested more than a dozen people in connection with the killings, which it blames on the militia - though one report to the U.N. Security Council suggested state security services could also be involved. The Swedish Prosecution Authority launched its own investigation into Catalan s death, and said on Wednesday it had received no response to a request it made in April for information from Congolese authorities.  The Swedish investigation is facing severe difficulties given the fact that it is completely reliant on evidence that exists in the Congo and cooperation is not working with Congo,  prosecutor Sara Nilsson said in the statement. Material that Swedish authorities had managed to collect  does not exclude that persons who have close ties to the regime in Congo are involved in the murders,  the Authority added. In April, Congo s government screened a video to reporters, which it said showed members of the militia killing Catalan and Sharp. But analysts said the grainy footage raised more questions than it answered and Nilsson told Reuters the screening had tainted important evidence.  Congo s government spokesman Lambert Mende has denied Congolese officials were involved in the murders and said on Wednesday that it was up to Swedish authorities to provide information to the Congolese court hearing the case, not the other way around.  Justice is rendered here because the crime was committed here,  Mende said.  If they have information that the court might not be able to access, they should give it to the court.  The conflict in Kasai region between Congo s army and the Kamuina Nsapu militia has killed as many as 5,000 people and displaced around 1.5 million more since August last year.  The United Nations has repeatedly accused Congolese forces of using excessive force and targeting civilians with alleged ties to the militia. The government denies those charges. ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican leaders in the U.S. House of Representatives are working to build support to temporarily extend the National Security Agency’s expiring internet surveillance program by tucking it into a stop-gap funding measure, lawmakers said. The month-long extension of the surveillance law, known as Section 702 of the Foreign Intelligence Surveillance Act, would punt a contentious national security issue into the new year in an attempt to buy lawmakers more time to hash out differences over various proposed privacy reforms.  Lawmakers leaving a Republican conference meeting on Wednesday evening said it was not clear whether the stop-gap bill had enough support to avert a partial government shutdown on Saturday, or whether the possible addition of the Section 702 extension would impact its chances for passage. It remained possible lawmakers would vote on the short-term extension separate from the spending bill. Absent congressional action the law, which allows the NSA to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the United States, will expire on Dec. 31.  Earlier in the day, House Republicans retreated from a plan to vote on a stand-alone measure to renew Section 702 until 2021 amid sizable opposition from both parties that stemmed from concerns the bill would violate U.S. privacy rights. Some U.S. officials have recently said that deadline may not ultimately matter and that the program can lawfully continue through April due to the way it is annually certified. But lawmakers and the White House still view the law’s end-year expiration as significant.  “I think clearly we need the reauthorization for FISA, and that is expected we’ll get that done” before the end of the year, Marc Short, the White House’s legislative director, said Wednesday on MSNBC. U.S. intelligence officials consider Section 702 among the most vital of tools at their disposal to thwart threats to national security and American allies. The law allows the NSA to collect vast amounts of digital communications from foreign suspects living outside the United States. But the program incidentally gathers communications of Americans for a variety of technical reasons, including if they communicate with a foreign target living overseas.  Those communications can then be subject to searches without a warrant, including by the Federal Bureau of Investigation. The House Judiciary Committee advanced a bill in November that would partially restrict the U.S. government’s ability to review American data by requiring a warrant in some cases.

       " 'GENEVA (Reuters) - The top U.N. human rights official on Monday denounced Myanmar s  brutal security operation  against Muslim Rohingyas in Rakhine state, saying it was disproportionate to insurgent attacks carried out last month. Communal tensions appeared to be rising across Myanmar on Monday after two weeks of violence in Rakhine state that have triggered an exodus of about 300,000 Rohingya Muslims, prompting the government to tighten security at Buddhist pagodas. Zeid Ra ad al-Hussein, addressing the United Nations Human Rights Council, said that more than 270,000 people had fled to Bangladesh, with more trapped on the border, amid reports of the burning of villages and extrajudicial killings.  We have received multiple reports and satellite imagery of security forces and local militia burning Rohingya villages, and consistent accounts of extrajudicial killings, including shooting fleeing civilians,  Zeid told the Geneva forum. He cited reports that Myanmar authorities had begun to lay landmines along the border with Bangladesh and would require returnees to provide  proof of citizenship . Rohingya have been stripped of civil and political rights including citizenship rights for decades, he added.  I call on the government to end its current cruel military operation, with accountability for all violations that have occurred, and to reverse the pattern of severe and widespread discrimination against the Rohingya population,  Zeid said.  The situation seems a textbook example of ethnic cleansing.   Last year Zeid s office issued a report, based on interviews with Rohingya who fled to Bangladesh after a previous military assault, which he said on Monday had  suggested a widespread or systematic attack against the community, possibly amounting to crimes against humanity .  I deplore current measures in India to deport Rohingyas at a time of such violence against them in their country,  Zeid said, noting that some 40,000 Rohingyas had settled in India, including 16,000 who have received refugee documentation.  Noting India s obligations under international law, he said:  India cannot carry out collective expulsions, or return people to a place where they risk torture or other serious violations.  ',\n",

The resolution specifically mentions Muslims, no other religious groups, and will serve as a test by which further criminalizing of  Islamophobia  may be introduced.Democrats have shamelessly lumped together  hate speech  with  violence  in an effort to compare criticism of Islam to physically harming Muslims. H. Res. 569 threatens to restrict our right to even report facts that tarnish Islam s reputation, a law that all Sharia-governed countries already have in place.According to Congress.gov, the resolution reads: Now, therefore, be it resolved, that the House of Representatives denounces in the strongest terms the increase of hate speech, intimidation, violence, vandalism, arson, and other hate crimes targeted against mosques, Muslims, or those perceived to be Muslim; urges local and Federal law enforcement authorities to work to prevent hate crimes; and to prosecute to the fullest extent of the law those perpetrators of hate crimes Muslims are slaughtering innocent people more than any other religious groups combined, all while refusing as a whole to condemn this barbaric Islamic terrorism, yet we are working to ensure these silent, consenting  moderates  have special protection   protection that they have never allowed religious minorities in their own countries.In another passage, Democrats laughably purport that Muslims have contributed to the fabric of American society, but we re assuming they don t mean terrorist attacks on U.S. soil, countless frivolous CAIR lawsuits, whitewashed Islamic education in public schools, or whining about pork products and a lack of taxpayer-funded prayer rooms. Whereas this Muslim community is recognized as having made innumerable contributions to the cultural and economic fabric and well-being of United States society  Still, the bill is purposefully vague in that it mentions prosecuting the perpetrators of  hate speech,  yet gives no definition for what it considers hate speech. Of course, we who have spoken out about the intolerant fundamentals of Islam understand that this means uttering anything critical of Islam or its followers, regardless of facts or relevance to the Quran.In conclusion, the bill ridiculously compares criticizing Islam as a violation of Muslims   civil rights,  as if disagreeing or even openly mocking someone s beliefs is unconstitutional. Our forefathers had exactly political and religious mockery in mind when they penned our amendments, having experience the violation of limited speech and worship by their own King George III.Indeed, free speech was never intended to defend inoffensive speech, because inoffensive speech needs no protection. Freedom of speech is solely for the offensive, meant to prevent those who would limit it because of their opposing beliefs. Via: RWN',\n",

Six of them were charged in April.During the past two years, more than 20 Somali-Americans from Minnesota have left to fight alongside terrorists with the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant, or ISIL, according to the FBI.The new indictment says that Ahmed and Musse bought airline tickets on Nov. 8, 2014, from New York s John F. Kennedy Airport to Europe, using more than $1,000 in federal college financial aid. Ahmed used his aid money to purchase a flight to Istanbul, Turkey, authorities say.

       " 'GLASGOW, Scotland (Reuters) - Most U.S. presidential candidates go abroad to sharpen their foreign policy credentials. Donald Trump arrives in Scotland on Friday to reopen a golf resort. The presumptive Republican nominee, 70, visits his family’s ancestral homeland to showcase his far-flung business empire. His mother was born on Scotland’s Isle of Lewis. With a throng of reporters watching, he will make a dramatic arrival by helicopter at his seaside Trump Turnberry resort. He has scheduled a news conference on the 9th hole at noon (7 a.m. ET/1100 GMT). His visit to Turnberry, to be followed by a stop at his resort in Aberdeen on Saturday, will allow him to comment on the outcome of Britain’s vote on Thursday on whether to remain in the European Union. “I don’t think opening a golf resort gets you many foreign policy chops,” said Saul Anuzis, former chairman of the Michigan Republican Party. “But since he’s there right in the middle of the EU vote, it may end up being a PR bonanza for him.” The risk is that the real-estate tycoon, who has yet to hold public office and rates unfavorably with 70 percent of Americans in an opinion poll, will make a foreign policy misstep at a time when Republican leaders are urging a more serious demeanor. Trump has said he would be inclined to leave the EU. He has exchanged insults with British Prime Minister David Cameron, who has called the New Yorker’s anti-immigrant policy ideas divisive and wrong. There are no plans for the two to meet. His trip has baffled Republican officials who say he should concentrate on strengthening his campaign and taking the fight to the presumptive Democratic nominee, former U.S. Secretary of State Hillary Clinton, who is 68. Trump defeated a crowded field of opponents for the Republican nomination but has faced one controversy after another, the latest over his firing of his campaign manager this week, a month before the party convention. “His campaign has got all kinds of growing pains and it doesn’t make sense that he would spend any kind of time going out of the country,” said David Yepsen, director of the Paul Simon Public Policy Institute at Southern Illinois University.  Turnberry is a storied course where the Open Championship has been staged four times. Trump invested $290 million in renovating the resort and golf course on Scotland’s West Coast 85 km (53 miles) southwest of Glasgow. He has portrayed his determination to build up courses in Turnberry and Aberdeen and overcome local opposition as an example of the type of leadership skills that Americans would get if he wins the White House on Nov. 8. “Well, Scotland has already been won – and so will the United States,” Trump wrote in a column for The Press and Journal newspaper in Aberdeen. An Aberdeen family opposed to his development there has threatened to raise a Mexican flag as a reminder of his proposal to build a wall along the U.S. southern border to keep out immigrants who enter illegally. The last Republican presidential nominee, former Massachusetts Governor Mitt Romney, in 2012 made a gaffe-filled campaign trip to London, Jerusalem and Poland. ',\n",
       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - The U.S. government may become a movie and music industry player, at least temporarily, after moving to seize $1 billion in assets that prosecutors said were bought with money looted from the Malaysian state development fund.  The 2013 movie “The Wolf of Wall Street” and an interest in the rights of EMI Music Publishing are among the targets of civil lawsuits that are filled with allegations that Malaysian officials, their relatives and associates laundered the fund’s money and hid it in property, artwork and luxury goods in the United States. Seizures of assets by government authorities are fairly common, but they more typically involve sports cars, yachts and jewelry bought with drug trafficking proceeds or with profits from white-collar crime. The case of the Malaysian sovereign wealth fund 1MDB announced on Wednesday is unusually large and involves some out-of-the-ordinary assets, such as rights associated with the dark comedy film starring Leonardo DiCaprio as a corrupt New York stockbroker. The film could make another $100 million in the near future, a box office analyst said. According to the lawsuits, a Malaysian national involved in creating 1MDB, Low Taek Jho, used about $10 million from 1MDB to invest in the film and separately used about $107 million to buy “a substantial interest” in EMI, the world’s third-largest music publishing company by revenue.  Low did not respond to requests for comment sent to his Hong Kong-based company, Jynwel Capital. U.S. government-seized assets are usually sold off at auction to raise money for victims. Until that can happen, U.S. authorities must maintain the assets, officials said. The U.S. Marshals Service manages and auctions seized assets. If a judge approves the seizure of 1MDB-linked assets, the usual process would be followed, Justice Department spokesman Peter Carr said. The assets would be initially restrained so their owners could not sell or transfer them. Any profits generated would be held in escrow until the case was resolved, Carr said. “We would sell those interests and, if possible and appropriate, use the proceeds of those sales for the benefit of the victim citizens in Malaysia,” Carr said in an email.  In the 1990s, the government owned shares in a California casino and through a trustee helped to manage it, putting Washington for a short time in the gambling business. A Marshals Service spokeswoman said she did not immediately know if the agency had previously auctioned film and music royalty rights. The agency had 17,564 assets on hand as of September 2015, valued at $3.1 billion, its website said. Court papers filed by the Justice Department would, if approved by a judge, grant sweeping powers to the Marshals Service to manage the 1MDB-linked assets. Under a proposed restraining order, Red Granite Pictures, which produced “The Wolf of Wall Street,” would have to maintain present contracts related to the film and “allow the United States to join in and direct key business decisions about day to day operations.” In a statement, Red Granite said that to its knowledge, none of the money it received was illegitimate and that co-founder Riza Aziz and the company did nothing wrong. Aziz is the stepson of Malaysian Prime Minister Najib Razak, who oversaw the 1MDB fund. The Justice Department lawsuits said that high-level officials of 1MDB corruptly diverted more than $3.5 billion from the fund over six years. ',\n",
       " \"Days after Trump and his team cynically seized on the shooting of Republican Congressman Steve Scalise to argue Democrats were stoking violence by opposing Trump, the White House hosted an event with Al Baldasaro, a man who was investigated by the Secret Service for threatening to kill Hillary Clinton just months ago.Team Trump was so thrilled to have Baldasaro in the East Room (where former presidents typically hosted dignitaries and icons, not clowns and assholes) that some posed for selfies with him.On the left you have Al Baldasaro in the East Room today. He called for Hillary Clinton to be shot by a firing squad https://t.co/6VNHm9jmCK pic.twitter.com/4jKrsDVYKw  Yashar Ali (@yashar) June 23, 2017And here's @KellyannePolls today with Baldasaro who called for Clinton to be shot by a firing squad twice. https://t.co/6VNHm9jmCK pic.twitter.com/5A0umreNXk  Yashar Ali (@yashar) June 23, 2017Per New York Times reporters Glenn Thrush and Maggie Haberman, Baldasora was there to celebrate one of Trump s publicity bill signings in the White House.The guy who called for Hillary Clinton to be shot last year was invited to Trump's bill signing at the WH today, per pooler @maggieNYT  Glenn Thrush (@GlennThrush) June 23, 2017Almost exactly one year ago, Baldasaro was under investigation after going on a violent rant about then-candidate Hillary Clinton. Hillary Clinton should be put in the firing line and shot for treason. His words echoed Trump s own. Then-candidate Trump had stoked the idea that Hillary Clinton had committed  treason  and his followers ate it up. At one point, he encouraged  2nd Amendment  people to take care of her if she were to get elected. (He later claimed it was a joke.)Flashforward to today.The double standards are obvious. The same team that smiled and posed for pictures with Baldasaro were condemning liberal celebrities like Kathy Griffin for promoting violence against Trump just days ago. Kellyanne Conway, no stranger to blatant hypocrisy, ran to the nearest camera to condemn Democrats for Scalise s shooting by a lone gunman.You can oppose policies, but it s done with such hateful, charged rhetoric that active resistance becomes armed resistance in the case of this lone gunman. The fact that she not only tolerates but celebrates a right-winger who has called for her political opponent to be shot speaks volumes.Press Secretary (for the moment) Sean Spicer was asked why Trump thought it was okay to invite this lunatic to a White House event and, as usual, Spicer played dumb.Spicer asked about why it's okay to have Baldasaro in East Room, he seemed genuinely unaware (or not remembering) the assassination call.  Maggie Haberman (@maggieNYT) June 23, 2017Spicer also claimed that Trump  condemned  any calls for political violence   ignoring that Trump had praised Baldasaro just days after he had attacked Hillary Clinton in 2016. If Trump s  condemnation  is to praise the guy he s condemning then invite him for a photo op in the East Room, it s hard to see how that qualifies for standing up to violence.Featured image via Twitter\",\n",

       " 'WINSTON-SALEM, N.C. (Reuters) - A state judge in North Carolina gave residents in counties hit hard by Hurricane Matthew five extra days to register to vote after Democrats sued to get an extension to Friday’s deadline, while a federal judge ordered an extension in one Georgia county. The Democratic Party in North Carolina challenged the state election board’s refusal to extend the cutoff date, saying in its suit that thousands of people would have been deprived of their fundamental right to vote in the Nov. 8 election if Friday’s deadline was not extended by at least five days.  The judge ordered an extension to next Wednesday in 36 counties, a lawyer for the state Democratic Party said on Twitter. “This ruling will ensure that those communities who have suffered from the devastating flooding brought on by Hurricane Matthew have the grace period that they need in order to exercise their right to vote and make their voices heard in this critical election,” party officials said. Twenty-four people have died in North Carolina and thousands have been forced from their homes in the eastern and central parts of the state due to record flooding in Matthew’s aftermath.  North Carolina is a battleground state in the presidential election and could play a pivotal role in the race between Democrat Hillary Clinton and Republican Donald Trump. State officials said this week they would not extend the regular deadline to register to vote, but allowances would be made for forms delayed by mail delivery. Those who miss the deadline can still register and vote on the same day during the statewide early voting period from Oct. 20 through Nov. 5. The state has a Republican governor, Pat McCrory, who faces a tough contest for re-election. The state’s Republican Party opposed any extension. “It is clear that North Carolina Democrats, who have been dominated in voter registration by Republicans, want to use a horrific natural disaster to change the rules in the middle of the game,” state Republican Chairman Robin Hayes said in a statement. In Georgia, U.S. District Judge William Moore ordered the voter registration deadline extended until Tuesday in Chatham County, which includes the city of Savannah. The judge said the administrative difficulties of doing so “pale in comparison to the physical, emotional and financial strain Chatham County residents faced in the aftermath of Hurricane Matthew.” A federal judge on Wednesday gave residents in Florida six extra days to register to vote after that state’s Democratic Party sued for more time due to Matthew. South Carolina extended its registration deadline due to Matthew from Oct. 7 to Oct. 11. ',\n",
       " 'HAVANA (Reuters) - U.S. President Barack Obama challenged Cuba’s Communist government with an impassioned call for democracy and economic reforms on Tuesday, addressing the Cuban people directly in a historic speech broadcast throughout the island. Taking the stage at Havana’s Grand Theater with President Raul Castro in attendance, Obama said he was in Cuba to extend a hand of friendship and “bury the last remnant” of the Cold War in the Americas. But he also pressed hard for economic and political reforms and greater openness in a one-party state where the government stifles dissent, Internet access is low and the media is in state hands. His speech was the high point of a 48-hour trip made possible by his agreement with Castro in December 2014 to cast aside decades of hostility that began soon after Cuba’s 1959 revolution, and work to normalize relations.  Nonetheless, Obama threw down a very public gauntlet to Castro, saying Cubans cannot realize their full potential if his government does not allow change and relax its grip on Cuban politics and society.  “I believe citizens should be free to speak their minds without fear,” Obama told the audience on the final day of his visit. “Voters should be able to choose their governments in free and democratic elections.” “Not everybody agrees with me on this, not everybody agrees with the American people on this but I believe those human rights are universal. I believe they’re the rights of the American people, the Cuban people and people around the world,” Obama said. The hand-picked audience cheered him repeatedly, especially when he criticized the longstanding U.S. economic embargo against Cuba, spoke glowingly of Cubans’ talents and praised the country’s achievements in healthcare and education.  The spectacle of the leader of the United States, the superpower to the north for long reviled by Cuba’s government, standing in Havana and urging such changes in a speech broadcast into homes across the island would have been unthinkable before the two countries began their rapprochement 15 months ago. Since then, Obama has repeatedly used his executive powers to relax trade and travel restrictions, while also pushing Cuba to accelerate cautious market-style reforms introduced by Castro and allow greater political and economic freedom.  Castro has welcomed Obama’s moves while insisting that a new relationship with the old enemy does not mean Cuba plans to change its political system. The audience of more than 1,000 people at Obama’s speech on Tuesday included officials and business people from both countries, U.S. lawmakers and members of Cuba’s cultural elite. Obama drew sustained applause when he reiterated his call for the U.S. Congress to lift the embargo, which he called “an outdated burden on the Cuban people.”  But the response was more muted when he challenged Castro to allow greater political liberties.  Obama went straight from the speech to a private meeting with prominent dissidents on the island, a few of whom object to his engagement policy. “As far as I am concerned nothing has changed, the repression continues,” said Berta Soler from the Ladies in White group, who met Obama at the embassy. Cuba’s government dismisses the dissidents as mercenaries without public support but Obama applauded their work and “extraordinary courage.” Obama sees his dramatic shift away from a decades-old policy of trying to isolate and weaken Cuba as a success story and wants to make it an irreversible part of his legacy by the time he leaves office in January. Still, major obstacles remain to full normalization of ties, notably the differences over human rights, the Republican-controlled U.S. Congress’ refusal to lift the embargo and Washington’s resistance to discussing the return of the U.S. naval base at Guantanamo Bay, Cuba. Obama’s critics at home have criticized his visit to Cuba as a premature reward to the Communist government. U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan, a Republican, said on Tuesday the trip legitimizes what he called Castro’s “tyrannical dictatorship.” With his words carried live by Cuba’s state-run media, Obama sought to persuade ordinary Cubans that his new policy was focused primarily on helping them to improve their lives. Standing at a lectern flanked by U.S. and Cuban flags, he laid out a hopeful vision of future relations and told Cubans “it’s up to you” to take steps to change the country. Obama pointedly stopped short of what some of his critics had demanded – that he echo U.S. President Ronald Reagan’s famous exhortation in a 1987 speech in West Berlin for Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev to tear down the Berlin Wall. But he did encourage Cubans to embrace democracy, set up their own businesses and help improve Cuban society. “Many suggested that I come here and ask the people of Cuba to tear something down. But I’m appealing to the young people of Cuba who will lift something up, build something new,” he said. Some Cubans who saw the speech in their homes or local cafes were also impressed by his frank admission of America’s own failings. “He has been very honest in his statements,” said Santiago Rodriguez, 78, in his home in central Havana. “It is not only the blockade (embargo) that has overwhelmed us for years. This was a message full of suggestions and positive criticism for the future of Cuba.” Castro, an army general who took over as president from his ailing brother, Fidel Castro, in 2008, was at the theater to greet Obama on arrival and sat in the audience for the speech. At the end, he lightly applauded from the balcony, then waved to the crowd. Later, the two leaders entered together to loud applause at Havana’s Latin American Stadium and sat side-by-side for a baseball game between Cuba’s much-loved national team and Major League Baseball’s Tampa Bay Rays. Castro was also on hand at the airport to bid Obama farewell, giving him an enthusiastic handshake at the bottom of Air Force One’s stairway and then exchanging waves once the U.S. leader reached the top. After the two men met on Monday, they aired some of the old grievances between their countries at a joint news conference, even as they sought to advance the diplomatic thaw. Obama’s administration is seeking to galvanize the Cuban people to help him pressure their government for reforms. But flashes of anger from Castro at the news conference illustrated how Washington runs the risk of being accused of meddling. Obama’s address on Tuesday was the first time a sitting U.S. president’s speech was broadcast to the Cuban people while on Cuban soil – although speeches by visiting popes have been carried live by state media. Jimmy Carter, traveling to Cuba in 2002 as the first former U.S. president to visit since the revolution, also called for political freedoms in a speech broadcast on live television. ',\n",
       " 'The presidential debate schedule is already out, and, true to form, Donald Trump is already throwing a livid fit about it. He doesn t like the fact that two of the debates are scheduled on the same nights as NFL games, which would be understandable if he wasn t busy saying Hillary Clinton is responsible for that. However, he crossed a major line in his accusations, and it has already come back to bite him hard.In an interview with ABC News, he made the following ridiculous claim: Well, I ll tell you what I don t like. It s against two NFL games. I got a letter from the NFL saying,  This is ridiculous. Why are the debates against   cause the NFL doesn t wanna go against the debates.  Cause the debates are gonna be pretty massive, from what I understand, OK? And I don t think we should be against the NFL. Now, aside from the obvious questions of why the NFL would be sending Trump a letter about this, rather than the Commission on Presidential Debates, it appears that this is one of Trump s most blatant lies yet. CNN s Brian Stetler says the NFL responded by disavowing any contact with Trump at all: While we d obviously wish the debate commission could find another night, we did not send a letter to Trump. And there it is. Most politicians who are given to lies will at least attempt to lie in such a way that it s hard to prove, even with a statement from whomever or whatever they re lying about. Not Trump! No he s so important that it doesn t matter that the debate schedule has been in place for a year already. Agencies like the NFL will communicate to him first, because he s just that crucial to the whole process.Why is this significant? Because it s not a gaffe. A gaffe is when a politician, pundit, or someone else heavily involved in politics accidentally lets loose what s really on their minds. Romney s 47 percent comment four years ago is a gaffe. Trump, however, commits gaffes and also tells outright lies. And because of that, it s virtually pointless to fact-check him, because even with a statement from whoever he s lied about, he ll double down on it.If nothing else, this lie, while seemingly stupid, provides a deep look into the psyche of the man who is Donald Trump. He ll say whatever he wants   he doesn t care. And if the NFL wants to take him down a notch or twelve by denying they even communicated with him, then he ll make sure they re sorry for making him look like the fool that he is. Or he ll ignore them altogether.His fa ade is coming down, and only the truly brainwashed voters, along with the white supremacist masses he s attracted, remain willfully blind to his lack of honesty. The NFL is a major organization. They just made Trump look very bad indeed.Featured image by Regine Mahaux/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'EDINBURGH (Reuters) - Scotland s Brexit minister believes there is a  pretty strong  chance Britain will leave the European Union with no deal, but that the UK government could collapse before then. Michael Russell said the devolved pro-independence Scottish administration is trying to prepare for Brexit, despite Scots having voted against it, but possible outcomes are  legion .  I think the chances (Brexit) happens without an agreement are still pretty strong, that there will a crashing out,  Russell, who is heading Scottish Brexit talks with the UK government, told Reuters.  It is also distinctly possible (...) that the government will fall and there will be another election or another government will come in,  he added. British Prime Minister Theresa May is running a minority Conservative government, kept in power by a Northern Irish Protestant party. Russel said it was unclear what any new government might do.  Will it start negotiations afresh, what will be its mandate, what will it be negotiating for?  Russell said, describing his frustration with the process and its uncertainty. Britain s vote to leave the EU has divided the main parties over what new relationship it wants with the trading bloc after 40 years of shared ties. It has also strained the ties of the UK s four nations, because Scotland and Northern Ireland voted to keep EU membership while Wales and most-populous England voted to leave. On key issues, such as the set-up of powers devolved beyond London s parliament after Brexit and the need for fluid EU immigration, Edinburgh s Scottish nationalist administration is at loggerheads with the Conservative UK government in London. Earlier on Wednesday, Britain s First Secretary of State Damian Green said Britain believes no deal is very unlikely but was readying contingency plans just in case. As recently as Tuesday, the UK s Brexit Minister David Davis said Britain was ready to walk away with no deal.   If we leave without a deal, we have to look at whether there will be democratic legitimacy in that, how would that be confirmed. Would (Britain s parliament) accept that we leave without a deal? I think that s unlikely in its present composition,  said Russell, whose formal title is Minister for UK Negotiations on Scotland s Place in Europe. Russell described Brexit as the  existential threat to Scotland s future  and said his government was preparing, to the extent that it could, for all options regarding Brexit. For that reason, he argued, Scotland should be offered a new choice which might include independence from the UK   rejected by Scottish voters in 2014 by a 10 percentage point margin   once it is clear what Brexit means.  At some stage the people of Scotland will have to be asked whether they want to stay with something which is completely disastrous and will not produce a good result, of that I have no doubt, or whether we do something else,  he said. In a June general election Russell s Scottish National Party suffered heavy losses - albeit from a very high level - and was forced to withdraw its offer of a new independence referendum as a result.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee voted overwhelmingly on Thursday in favor of President Donald Trump’s nominee to be director of national intelligence, former Republican Senator Dan Coats, sending his nomination to the Senate floor. The vote, which took place in a closed hearing, was 13-2, the committee said. Democratic Senators Ron Wyden and Kamala Harris were the only two members to vote no. Coats must still be confirmed by the full Senate to be the top U.S. intelligence official. The popular former lawmaker, who also served as ambassador to Germany, is expected to be confirmed easily. The Office of the Director of National Intelligence was created after the Sept. 11, 2001, attacks to oversee all 16 U.S. intelligence agencies and improve communications among them. Coats, 73, replaces James Clapper, who retired as President Barack Obama left office. Coats was a member of the Senate intelligence panel until he retired from the Senate at the end of last year. He pledged during his confirmation hearing on Feb. 28 to support a thorough investigation of any Russian effort to influence the 2016 presidential election. Wyden, one of the Senate’s leading privacy advocates, said he voted against his former colleague because he felt that the office of the Director of National Intelligence had not provided the committee with enough information about how many Americans’ communication records have been subjected to government surveillance. “Given that there has not been a firm commitment to deliver this critical information, I cannot support any DNI nominee without that material,” Wyden said in a statement. Harris said that after consideration of Coats’ record on a range of issues, she concluded she could not support his nomination. Senators Richard Burr, the committee’s Republican chairman, and Mark Warner, its top Democrat, both said they were pleased the committee had backed Coats. Warner said he was confident that Coats, as a former committee member, had respect for the panel’s oversight responsibilities. ',\n",
       " 'CLEVELAND (Reuters) - Thirteen months after launching an improbable bid for the White House, Donald Trump captured the 2016 Republican presidential nomination on Tuesday, having vanquished 16 party rivals, warred with much of its establishment and provoked controversy at every turn. His eldest child, Donald Trump Jr., announced the support of New York, their home state, during a roll-call vote at the Republican National Convention, ensuring Trump had the majority of delegates - 1,237 - needed to contest the Nov. 8 U.S. presidential election against presumptive Democratic nominee Hillary Clinton. With three of the candidate’s other children at his side, the younger Trump said: “It is my honor to be able to throw Donald Trump over the top in the delegate count tonight.” “Congratulations, Dad. We love you,” he said. Trump’s Democratic rival, Clinton, who has been the target of withering verbal attacks during the convention, was quick to respond to the vote, tweeting: “Donald Trump just became the Republican nominee. Chip in now to make sure he never steps foot in the Oval Office.” Trump won with 1,725 delegates, followed by U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas with 475 delegates, Ohio Governor John Kasich with 120 and U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida with 114. Three other candidates emerged with a total of 12 delegates. After the presidential nominating vote, the convention by voice vote nominated Indiana Governor Mike Pence, 57, Trump’s choice for his vice presidential running mate. Speaking to the convention for the first time since winning the nomination, Trump appeared on a video screen from New York promising to win the election in November, create jobs, strengthen the military, safeguard U.S. borders and “restore law and order” in the United States. The state-by-state vote to put Trump’s name in nomination took place a day after opponents staged a failed attempt to force a vote opposing his candidacy at the start of the four-day convention, and after a speech by his wife, Melania, drew accusations of plagiarism. A wealthy New York real estate developer best known to Americans for his starring role in a long-running TV show, “The Apprentice,” where his catchphrase was “You’re fired,” the 70-year-old Trump was a long shot when he entered the race for the Republican nomination more than a year ago, having never held elected office. On Tuesday, under the headline “Make America Work Again,” speakers at Cleveland’s Quicken Loans basketball arena were meant to assail Democratic President Barack Obama’s record on the economy during his nearly eight years in power. Instead, speaker after speaker took aim at Clinton, presenting her as out of touch with the concerns of ordinary Americans and the inheritor of Obama’s “oppressive” administration. A former secretary of state under Obama, Clinton, 68, was due to be formally nominated at the Democratic National Convention next week in Philadelphia. Trump trails Clinton in many opinion polls after a bruising Republican primary season. Trump narrowed his deficit against her to 7 percentage points from 15 points late last week, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Tuesday.  Trump initially refused to rule out an independent run should he fail to win the Republican nomination.  Within weeks of announcing his candidacy at Trump Tower in New York on June 16, 2015, Trump had taken a commanding lead in the Republican race, defying pundits who were quick to write him off and eclipsing the man many had thought would be crowned on Tuesday night - former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, part of a Republican political dynasty. In a campaign marked by insults and inflammatory rhetoric, Trump tapped into a deep vein of unhappiness running through white Middle America, giving voice to millions who felt left behind in the rush to globalization and who eschewed traditional establishment Republicans like Bush in favor of a brash political outsider who promised to “Make America Great Again”. “We’ve lost the confidence in our leaders and the faith in our institutions,” Donald Trump Jr. said in a convention speech. “We’re still Americans. We’re still one country and we’re going to get it all back.” “I know we’ll get it back because I know my father,” Trump Jr. said. Opponents brand Trump a bigot with his calls to temporarily ban the entry of Muslims and to build a border wall with Mexico to keep out illegal immigrants. Underscoring the problems Trump has faced with U.S. allies abroad, German Foreign Minister Frank-Walter Steinmeier said Trump threatened U.S. and world security with his “politics of fear and isolation.” Steinmeier told Reuters in a written interview that he was concerned about what he called Trump’s ambiguous vows to “make America strong again,” while simultaneously reducing its engagement overseas. Party officials hope to use the convention to smooth out some of Trump’s rough edges and present him as a job creator and a strong hand to combat security threats at home and abroad. U.S. Senator Jeff Sessions of Alabama, an early backer of Trump, placed his name in nomination, calling him “a warrior and a winner.” Two senior Republicans, U.S. House of Representatives Speaker Paul Ryan and Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell, spoke in favor of Trump. Republicans need Trump to do well in the November election as they seek to preserve Republican majorities in Congress. Security forces were on high alert in Cleveland. But police said late on Tuesday there had been only five arrests since the convention began on Monday. Wright State University, a public university near Dayton, Ohio, said on Tuesday it had decided not to host the first U.S. presidential debate scheduled for Sept. 26, citing mounting costs and security concerns. The event will now be held at Hofstra University in New York. While in Cleveland, Trump ally Chris Christie said on Tuesday that should Trump win the presidency, he would seek to purge the federal government of officials appointed by Obama  and could ask Congress to pass legislation making it easier to dismiss public workers. Christie, who is governor of New Jersey and leads Trump’s White House transition team, told dozens of donors the campaign was drawing up a list of federal government employees to fire if Trump defeats Clinton.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Democratic presidential candidate Hillary Clinton will release her 2015 tax returns and her running mate, U.S. Senator Tim Kaine and his wife, Anne Holton, will release the last 10 years of their tax returns within days, according to a source close to Clinton. The returns will show Clinton paid an effective tax rate of 35 percent and gave about 10 percent to charity, CNBC reported. The release comes as Republican Donald Trump is facing criticism for not releasing his tax returns - a political practice that is not required by law but has been done by every White House nominee since 1973. “He refuses to do what every other presidential candidate in decades has done and release his tax returns,” Clinton said on Thursday in an economic speech in Michigan.   Clinton’s campaign has already released tax returns going back to 2007. In addition, tax returns are publicly available for the eight years her husband, former President Bill Clinton, was in the White House. Prior years were released by his campaign. Tax returns filed by the Clintons have been made public, in some form, for every year back to 1977. Trump, a New York businessman, has refused to release his tax returns, saying they are under audit by the Internal Revenue Service. He has said he is unlikely to do so before the Nov. 8 presidential election.  Critics, including 2012 Republican presidential nominee Mitt Romney, have blasted Trump for failing to disclose his tax rate and raised questions about what his returns say about his net worth and various business ties, particularly in Russia.     Asked in a television interview in May what tax rate he pays, Trump replied “It’s none of your business.” The IRS has said Trump can release his tax returns even while under audit. Besides showing sources and amounts of income, tax returns show what percentage tax rate a person ultimately pays, as well as how much they claimed in deductions and the amounts given to charities.   Earlier this month, at a Clinton rally in Omaha, Nebraska, billionaire investor Warren Buffett, whose Berkshire Hathaway (BRKa.N) conglomerate is based there, challenged Trump to make his returns public. “I’m under audit, too, and I would be delighted to meet him anyplace, anytime, before the election,” Buffett said. “I’ll bring my tax return, he can bring his tax return ... and let people ask us questions.” Trump has declined to do so.

       " \"Former National Security Adviser Michael Flynn gave Donald Trump something to worry about last night, when he announced that he would testify on the Trump campaign s possible ties to Russia in exchange for immunity. As more experts weigh in on this, it s not looking good for Trump at all. According to a former top intelligence official, the only way Flynn will get the immunity he s seeking is if he gives up Trump.Jeremy Bash, former counsel to the House Intelligence Committee and the ex-chief of staff for both the CIA and Department of Defense, weighed in on Flynn in an interview for MSNBC: For the Justice Department to agree to give somebody like him immunity, it means they want him to turn and testify against someone higher up in the food chain. Who is higher up in the food chain, higher than the national security adviser? There s really only one person, and so this shows that the jeopardy of criminal liability actually extends all the way to the top. As of right now, Flynn s offer to testify for immunity has not been accepted by investigators, which makes Bash wonder, Immunity from what? What is he in jeopardy of being prosecuted for?  Bash advised that Flynn could be prosecuted under the Espionage Act for getting classified briefings for the Trump campaign. Bash said: That is a major felony, and that is essentially treason. It would not surprise me at all if what the prosecutors said to Flynn s lawyers is,  We haven t reached any conclusions on the Russian matter, but we have your guy dead to rights for not registering under the laws requiring registration as a foreign agent and second of conspiring to engage in kidnapping   you better come in and make a deal.' Bash made sure to reiterate that investigators will not accept Flynn s offer unless he gave up information about crimes Trump had committed. Bash said: You can only give somebody immunity, full immunity, if it s worth it. They have to believe it s worth it in this case.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President Donald Trump this week will sign new executive orders before he completes his first 100 days in office, including two on energy and the environment, which would make it easier for the United States to develop energy on and offshore, a White House official said on Sunday. “This builds on previous executive actions that\\xa0have cleared the way for job-creating pipelines, innovations in energy production, and reduced unnecessary burden on energy producers,” the official said on condition of anonymity.\\xa0   On Wednesday, Trump is expected to sign an executive order related to the 1906 Antiquities Act, which enables the president to designate federal areas of land and water as national monuments to protect them from drilling, mining and development, the source said. On Friday, Trump is expected to sign an order to review areas available for offshore oil and gas exploration, as well as rules governing offshore drilling. The new measures would build on a number of energy- and environment-related executive orders signed by Trump seeking to gut most of the climate change regulations put in place by predecessor President Barack Obama. A summary of the forthcoming orders, seen by Reuters, say past administrations “overused” the Antiquities Act, putting more federal areas under protection than necessary. Obama had used the Antiquities Act more than any other president, his White House said in December, when he designated over 1.6 million acres of land in Utah and Nevada as national monuments, protecting two areas rich in Native American artifacts from mining, oil and gas drilling. The summary also says previous administrations have been “overly restrictive” of offshore drilling. Late in Obama’s second term, he banned new drilling in federal waters in parts of the Atlantic and Arctic Oceans using a 1950s-era law that environmental groups say would require a drawn out court challenge to reverse. Interior Secretary Ryan Zinke said during his January confirmation hearing that Trump could “amend” Obama’s monument designations but any move to rescind a designation would immediately be challenged. Last month, Trump signed an order calling for a review of Obama’s Clean Power Plan, and reversed a ban on coal leasing on federal lands. In addition to the energy-related orders, Trump is also expected this week to sign an order to create an office of accountability in the Veterans Affairs department. He is also expected to create a rural America interagency task force to recommend policies to address issues facing agricultural states. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Leaders of the U.S. Senate Intelligence Committee said on Wednesday the issue of whether President Donald Trump’s 2016 election campaign colluded with Russia remains an open question as the panel intensifies its probe into the matter. Republican Chairman Richard Burr and Democratic Vice Chairman Mark Warner also warned about the risk to future U.S. elections posed by Russia, including what is expected to be a closely contested election next month for governor of Warner’s home state, Virginia. Burr told reporters the committee plans to conduct 25 more interviews with witnesses this month, but described his goal of finishing this year the main congressional investigation into Russian meddling as only “aspirational” at this point. “The issue of collusion is still open,” Burr said, standing alongside Warner at a press conference to provide an update on the investigation. “We have not come to any determination on collusion,” he said. Burr said he wanted very much to conclude the investigation before the height of campaigning for November 2018 U.S. mid-term elections, when all 435 seats in the House of Representatives and one third of the 100-seat Senate will be up for grabs. Warner said the United States needed a “whole-of-government” approach to combating interference with U.S. elections. “The Russian active measures efforts did not end on Election Day, 2016,” he said.  Trump, who has called allegations of campaign collusion with Moscow a hoax, has faced questions about the matter since he took office in January. A special counsel appointed by the Justice Department, Robert Mueller, is conducting a separate probe that could lead to criminal charges. Russia denies meddling. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded that Russia interfered in the election to try to help Trump defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton through a campaign of hacking and releasing embarrassing emails, and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her campaign. Burr said the committee agreed with the intelligence community’s conclusion that Russia had interfered. “The committee continues to look into all evidence to see if there was any hint of collusion,” Burr said. “Now, I’m not even going to discuss initial findings because we haven’t any. We’ve got a tremendous amount of documents still to go through.” He said the panel has conducted more than 100 interviews lasting more than 250 hours in its nine-month-old probe, and “we currently have booked for the balance of this month 25 additional interviews.” Those who have already come before committee members or investigators include the president’s son-in-law and adviser Jared Kushner, former Trump campaign manager Paul Manafort, and social media executives such as officials from Twitter Inc (TWTR.N).  On Wednesday, a representative for Kushner and Ivanka Trump denied a report in USA Today that the couple had re-routed personal emails through their family’s business. Among witnesses who will appear at future public committee hearings are Trump’s personal attorney, Michael Cohen, and executives from Facebook Inc (FB.O), Twitter and Alphabet Inc’s (GOOGL.O) Google. Warner and Burr urged American election officials and political campaigns to take the threat of Russian interference seriously. “You can’t walk away from this and believe that Russia’s not currently active in trying to create chaos in our election process. And I assume that the same tactics that you saw in Montenegro, in France, in Belgium and in the United States will continue to be tested within our structure of the election process,” Burr said. Burr said the committee has “hit a wall” in its investigation of a former British spy’s explosive dossier on purported Russian support for Trump’s 2016 campaign. Former MI6 officer Christopher Steele compiled the dossier, which Trump was told by former FBI director James Comey contained salacious material about the businessman-turned-president. Trump and his associates have called the dossier’s contents false. “We have, on several occasions, made attempts to contact Mr. Steele, to meet with Mr. Steele,” Burr said. “Those offers have gone unaccepted. The committee cannot really decide the credibility of the dossier without understanding things like who paid for it, who are your sources and sub-sources,” Burr added.

       " 'A 14-year-old boy suffered a gunshot wound to the leg Wednesday (April 8) after a woman drove him and five other juveniles to a residence in Kenner to continue a fight that had occurred earlier in the day, authorities said.Police arrested the woman, Lakenya Hall, 35, of Kenner, because she instigated the fight by taking over the group of boys, which included her own 11- and 15-year-old sons, said Lt. Brian McGregor, spokesman for the Kenner Police Department.The injured teen was taken to nearby Ochsner Medical Center in Kenner where he is expected to recover.The shooting occurred just after 5 p.m. Wednesday in the 3500 block of West Louisiana State Drive in Kenner. Police learned that the teens had been involved in an earlier fight at a bus stop, McGregor said. Authorities aren t sure what the teens were fighting about.Afterwards, Hall, of 225 Clemson Place, drove six juveniles about a mile and a half away from their Lincoln Manor neighborhood to West Louisiana State Drive to continue the brawl, McGregor said.At some point, a 15-year-old boy being confronted by Hall s group pulled out a .22-caliber pistol that had been stored in a backpack and began chasing them, McGregor said. He opened fire, hitting the 14-year-old boy.Police arrested the 15-year-old boy and booked him with aggravated battery, illegal possession of a handgun by a juvenile, possession of a firearm with an obliterated serial number, illegal use of weapons and disturbing the peace by fighting, McGregor said.Officers arrested Hall and booked her with disturbing the peace by fighting and six counts of contributing to the delinquency of juveniles. Just because you ve been in a fight, it doesn t give you the right to go over there and start a whole new fight,  McGregor said.  She s instigating something by taking the group over there in the first place. Police also arrested Hall s two sons and booked them with disturbing the peace by fighting. Investigators expect more arrests to come as they identify the other teens who were present at the time of the fight and shooting, McGregor said.Authorities have also been told that video exists of the fight, and police are working to find it.  We re not going to have all these juveniles engaging in a fight in the city of Kenner,  McGregor said.',\n",

       " 'YANGON (Reuters) - Myanmar s army said on Monday that security forces have discovered a mass grave on the edge of a village in Rakhine State, and have launched an investigation. A violent crackdown by the security forces in response to attacks by militants in the state has caused around 650,000 Rohingya Muslims to flee to Bangladesh in recent months.   In a statement posted on the Facebook page of the military s commander-in-chief, Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, the army said the unidentified bodies had been found at the cemetery in the village of Inn Din, about 50 km (30 miles) north of state capital Sittwe. It did not say how many bodies were uncovered.    A preliminary investigation was done by the security forces following a report, by someone who asked not to be named, of people being killed and buried,  the army said.    As a result of the investigations, unidentified bodies were found at the Inn Din village cemetery and a detailed investigation is being conducted to get to the truth,  according to the statement on Facebook, which the army often uses to make announcements.   When contacted by Reuters, military spokesman Colonel Myat Min Oo declined to give further details. The village is in Maungdaw township, one of the areas worst affected by the violence that has prompted the United Nations  top human rights official to allege that Myanmar s security forces may have committed genocide against the Rohingya.   Myanmar s armed forces launched what they termed clearance operations in northern Rakhine, where many of the stateless Muslim minority lived, after Rohingya militants attacked 30 police posts and an army base on Aug. 25.   Rights monitors have accused troops of atrocities, including killings, mass rape and arson during those operations. The United States has said it amounted to  ethnic cleansing .   The Myanmar military has said its own internal investigation had exonerated security forces of all accusations of atrocities.   Myanmar s civilian leader, Aung San Suu Kyi, has faced fierce international criticism for failing to do more to protect the Rohingya.   The civilian government, which has no control over the military, has said the army was engaged in legitimate counter-insurgency operations. It has promised to investigate allegations of abuses in Rakhine if it is given evidence. ',\n",

       " 'HARRISBURG, Pa. (Reuters) - Pennsylvania Attorney General Kathleen Kane, who faces trial in August for allegedly leaking secret grand jury information, on Tuesday ruled out running for a second term. Kane is the first woman and first Democrat elected as the state’s top law enforcement officer, and her current four-year term concludes at the end of 2016. “(I’m) a mother first and foremost,” Kane, who is divorced and has two teenage sons, told reporters at a news conference in Scranton. “I have two very important people at home,” said Kane, 49, of Clarks Summit, Pennsylvania. “As you all know, being a single mother… that in itself is a full-time job.” She vigorously defended her time in office, especially her efforts to “rid the state of corruption” but declined to answer further questions. Tuesday marked the deadline in Pennsylvania for filing nominating petitions for the May primary election. Kane was expected to face at least two and possibly three Democratic opponents in the primary while at the same time defending herself against the legal charges.  Kane has been in legal hot water ever since her indictment last summer for allegedly passing grand jury information to a reporter as part of a personal feud. Her law license was suspended in October as a result of the grand jury indictment. Kane has portrayed herself as a victim of an “old boys’ network” worried about her efforts to expose prosecutors and Supreme Court judges who had exchanged sexually explicit or offensive emails on state computers.\\xa0 Last week, Democrats in the state Senate defeated a Republican-led effort to remove her from office on the grounds that her suspended law license made it impossible for her to do her job.

       " \"Trump has repeatedly said that all the ways he avoided paying taxes was legal, and has even shown his ignorance about how our government works to paint Hillary as incompetent because she didn t single-handedly change these laws during her time in the Senate. However, while he was busy avoiding taxes in the 1990s, his own lawyers warned him against doing, well, exactly what he did.A new report in The New York Times explains that, order to avoid total financial ruin, Trump didn t report hundreds of millions that was technically income. He didn t just not report it, though   the IRS would have seen through that immediately. Instead, his first step to avoiding taxes was successfully pushing his various bondholders to cancel the hundreds of millions he owed them.To the IRS, a dollar of canceled debt is a dollar of taxable income. That could have crippled the self-proclaimed master of debt and taxes about as badly as all that debt he couldn t pay. So what did he do? He used what s called a  stock-for-debt  swap maneuver.Except Congress banned that practice for corporations in 1993. However, Trump s real estate holdings in Atlantic City the ones that were all in trouble weren t corporations. They were partnerships. So he thought he could still swap what s called  partnership equity  for his debt.Apparently, this works even if the stocks, or, in Trump s case, the equities, are worth considerably less than the canceled debt. The Times says that this is as close as anyone can get to making taxes just magically disappear.But legally, this is fraught with its own problems and Trump s own lawyers actually warned him against doing it. He asked his tax attorneys for formal opinion letters on his plan, which all came back saying: The letters bluntly warned that there was no statute, regulation or judicial opinion that explicitly permitted Mr. Trump s tax gambit.  Due to the lack of definitive judicial or administrative authority,  his lawyers wrote,  substantial uncertainties exist with respect to many of the tax consequences of the plan.' In other words, they felt that his scheme wouldn t stand up to IRS scrutiny. We don t know if the IRS went after him for this because nobody has the whole story. However, from what we do have, tax expert and former chief tax council for the House Ways and Means Committee, John L. Buckley, was able to say: He s getting something for absolutely nothing. Buckley also said: He deducted somebody else s losses. He is double dipping big time. Buckley means that the only people who should have been able to deduct those losses were the bondholders who canceled his debts, and thus, lost out on their investments.This could be one of the bombshells he s hiding in his tax returns. Since all of this involved partnerships, profits could go straight to his personal returns, as could other items. With Trump refusing to release those, though, we don t know just how badly he stretched the law, if not broke it altogether.This scheme quite possibly laid the groundwork for his massive $916 million loss in 1995, which may have allowed him to avoid paying taxes again for 20 years. In other words, not only has he possibly sailed along while Americans who earn an honest day s pay for an honest day s work dutifully paid their taxes, but he very likely broke the law in all his machinations here in a way that the regular Americans he claims to understand would never get away with (hell, we wouldn t even know where to start, most likely).Oddly enough, using partnership equity swaps to avoid taxes was banned by Congress in 2004. Among the Senators who voted to close that loophole was Hillary Clinton.Featured image by Brian Blanco via Getty Images\",\n",

       " 'SHAH PORIR DWIP, Bangladesh (Reuters) - Bangladeshi authorities have destroyed about 20 boats that ferried Rohingya Muslims fleeing violence in Myanmar, accusing smugglers of using the huge exodus to bring methamphetamine into the country. Refugees told Reuters that border guards also beat and arrested passengers and crew as they landed at Shah Porir Dwip, on the southern tip of Bangladesh on Tuesday night, before the vessels were smashed to pieces by locals. The local commander of Border Guards Bangladesh (BGB), Lieutenant Colonel Ariful Islam, denied there were beatings, and said the action was a crackdown on human trafficking and the smuggling of methamphetamine, a drug known locally as  ya ba .  The boats are trying to carry passengers they are not supposed to,  he told Reuters. He accused the organizers of the boat journeys of exploiting destitute Rohingyas by charging them for the short trip to Bangladesh. Some passengers told Reuters they had paid 10,000 Bangladeshi taka ($123) each for the trip, although others said they traveled free. More than half a million Rohingya Muslims have arrived in Bangladesh from predominantly Buddhist Myanmar since its armed forces responded to attacks by militants on Aug. 25 with a counteroffensive described by United Nations officials as  ethnic cleansing . While four passengers told Reuters they saw no drugs on board, Lieutenant Colonel Islam said border guards had found a large quantity of the drugs in the water on Tuesday night.  Maybe the carrier had dropped it before disembarking,  he said. At a teeming processing center in nearby Teknaf, Ibrahim Holil, from the village of Maungdaw Moknibara in Myanmar s Rakhine State, described on Wednesday how he said he was hit with a stick by a border guard as he helped his relatives disembark from their boat.  There is nothing in this boat. Only our belongings,  he said. Farous Ahmad, 65, said his two sons  - Sura Ahammed and Dildar Ahammed - were arrested soon after they landed. He said they had worked as crew on the trip because they had no money to pay the fare.  They also beat me everywhere. I do not know where my sons are,  he told Reuters.  I don t know why the BGB arrested my sons. People told me the BGB would shelter us in Bangladesh but yet they arrested them and also we had to spend the whole night sitting.  Asked about the allegations of beatings, Lieutenant Colonel Islam said:  It is never possible. Please check your source and motive.  Reuters reporters saw the remnants of the smashed boats. Nearby was a pile of sledgehammers and machetes. A local fisherman, Robi Alam, said the BGB had given local people money to destroy the boats. Bangladeshi authorities said last month they would crack down on fisherman charging Rohingya for ferrying them to safety, which they described as human trafficking.    Thousands of people continue to cross land and sea borders daily to reach Bangladesh, putting great strain on one of the poorest regions of a poor country. One refugee, who asked not to be identified, said his relatives were among 6,000 people waiting in Myanmar to cross to Bangladesh by boat on Wednesday night. He said news of the destruction of the boats and the arrests on Tuesday night had spread and he was concerned the owners of other vessels would be deterred from making the trip. Including the latest influx, about 1 million Rohingya, who were mostly stripped of their citizenship by a 1982 law passed by the military junta that then ruled Myanmar, now live in Bangladesh after fleeing periodic outbreaks of violence. Resentment against the stateless group has brewed for years in Bangladesh, where authorities have linked them to a surge in methamphetamine use. Seizures of the drug jumped more than 2,500 percent to 29.4 million pills between 2011 and 2016 and police and government officials say the Rohingya refugees, who cannot easily be traced, are the traffickers  preferred mules. The authorities have cited a growing drug problem as one reason for pushing ahead with a controversial scheme to move thousands of refugees from their border camps to an undeveloped island in the Bay of Bengal. Myanmar and Bangladesh are also discussing a framework for returning the Rohingyas to Myanmar. The two countries agreed on Monday to work on a repatriation plan, and a Myanmar government spokesman confirmed it would go along with it, provided people could verify their status with paperwork.

Obviously, we re not saying that in a clinical way because fortunately, we ve never met him, but he s thin-skinned, narcissistic, a pathological liar and doesn t give a crap about anyone other than himself. Politics aside, those qualities should keep him out of office.While there are a number of third party candidates running this time around, only one third party ticket is on the ballot in all 50 states and Washington, D.C., and that s the Libertarian ticket of Gary Johnson and his vice presidential candidate Bill Weld.Famed Watergate journalist Carl Bernstein believes the Johnson/Weld ticket might not hold up for long, and that Weld could be dropping out of the race to support Hillary Clinton.The Green Party ticket is on the ballot in 40 states and Washington, D.C. The Libertarian ticket is currently polling at 9 percent and the Green Party ticket is polling at 3 percent. Many are saying that the third party tickets are siphoning votes from Hillary Clinton, not Donald Trump and according to Bernstein, Weld might not be able to live with that fact. He has  another day to fight for libertarianism,  according to Bernstein. He also believes that Weld could help bring Millennials into the Democratic fold. Bill Weld does not want to be Ralph Nader,   says Bernstein. Nader, as you recall, ran against Al Gore and George W. Bush in 2000 and many say that Gore would have won if Nader had not been in the race.Bernstein also feels that Weld is spinning his wheels on the Johnson ticket. He called Johnson a  flake,  and said that Weld wants to make a difference and the difference he can make is supporting Clinton.Here s the video:Could Libertarian VP candidate renounce his candidacy?

Mike Bost has been largely ducking his constituents by holding tele-town halls that they aren t informed about until the last minute, which means not a lot of people are able to participate. Those that do are dedicated supporters who will agree with everything Bost says without any push back whatsoever. The in-person ones going on around the United States right now are out of control, which means you don t actually get to talk to people and listen, and we re looking for ways to do that,  Bost told The Southern Illinoisan.And then Bost made a racist comparison to describe the angry people who are attending town halls.

You know the cleansing that the Orientals used to do where you d put one person out in front and 900 people yell at them? That s not what we need.

If all you want to do is stand and yell at me   we re not going back and forth. What Bost wants is a town hall where he won t be criticized and won t have to answer the criticism. You know, because Bost and Republicans like him are snowflakes who want to pretend that everyone likes them and what they are doing in Congress.Republicans know that repealing the Affordable Care Act is getting more and more unpopular as their own constituents begin to realize that they will lose their own healthcare.To explain the anger at town halls, Republicans have falsely portrayed their own constituents as out-of-state paid protesters rather than admit that they are wrong to repeal the landmark healthcare program.But as Republicans continue to duck their voters they will only make them angrier in the long run.

       " 'OSLO (Reuters) - Norway s next prime minister could be a man born into wealth and privilege who became the unlikely leader of the Labour Party, the political home of the working class. Jonas Gahr Stoere, 57, hopes to replace Conservative Prime Minister Erna Solberg, 56, after a Sept. 11 parliamentary election. With the left and right neck-and-neck in the polls and many voters undecided, the race is too close to call.  If he wins, it would be a victory for a millionaire, whose background was once deemed an obstacle to his ambition to lead a party rooted in the struggle for workers  rights. Stoere got massive attention in the media in 2013 when he failed, apparently by accident, to raise the national flag outside his house on International Workers  Day on May 1 - an important tradition in the labor movement.  I have not grown up in the traditional working class and I cannot explain my background away. Like everyone else I m the sum of my experiences,  he told the tabloid VG at the time. With a net worth of 64.5 million Norwegian crowns ($8.3 million), media interest in Stoere s investments has at times threatened to overshadow his campaign, leading him last week to divest stakes in a mutual fund that did not comply with the same ethical standards as the sovereign wealth fund. He served as foreign minister and health minister in the two cabinets of his friend, prime minister Jens Stoltenberg, in 2005-2013, and became Labour Party leader when Stoltenberg was named NATO Secretary General.  In 2010, while foreign minister, Stoere helped broker a deal to delineate an Arctic offshore border between Norway and Russia that had been in dispute for four decades.   Stoere was a very popular foreign minister, but has experienced problems as party leader,  Toril Aalberg, a professor of political science at the Norwegian University of Science and Technology in Trondheim told Reuters.  While there is a greater degree of consensus in Norwegian foreign policy, there is a greater degree of disagreement in domestic policy matters.  The son of a shipbroker, Stoere credits his conversion to social democracy to his move to study in France where he was confronted with starker class differences.  I learnt what kind of society I wanted to live in. In France, differences between people are large, larger than in Norway   between rich and poor, between those with education and those without, between city and countryside,  he wrote in a column for Norway s ABC News website in June.  In Norway, we have shaped a society where there are fewer differences. But we are not immune to this and this is not a given.  He attended Paris  prestigious Sciences Po university, became engaged in the movement to support Soviet dissidents, and traveled to the Soviet Union to provide supplies and support.  He organized a protest in support of Andrei Sakharov, then held in internal exile, persuading French star Yves Montand, a long-time Communist sympathizer, to deliver a letter to the Soviet embassy in Paris calling for the Nobel laureate s freedom. When he returned to Norway, Stoere worked closely with Norway s first female prime minister, Gro Harlem Brundtland, known as the  mother of the nation  in Norway, first as an adviser and later a senior civil servant under several governments between 1989 and 1997.  From 1998 to 2000 he followed Brundtland to the World Health Organisation to serve as chief of staff to the new executive director. He was also Secretary General of the Norwegian Red Cross from 2003 to 2005. If Labour wins the Sept. 11 vote, it would spend less money from Norway s near-trillion dollar sovereign wealth fund and instead raise taxes, arguing that the growth in oil revenue spending must slow.  Sound public finances are critical for welfare and critical for productivity,  Stoere told Reuters in an interview in June. Stoere also said he would be careful about allowing the sovereign wealth fund into new asset classes.  Political risk is clearly one issue. Spreading the focus of the fund too much is another one,  he said. To govern, Labour will need the support of the Centre Party, whose main support is in rural areas, with whom it shared power between 2005 and 2013. But depending on the outcome of the vote, Stoere may be in need of the support of the far-left Red Party and would face demands from the small-but-growing Green Party about limiting the reach of Norway s oil industry.  Stoere says he is adamant he would not accept the Green Party s ultimatum of shutting down the industry but his position may be more difficult to defend if he needs their support.  Forming a government is going to be difficult,  said Johannes Bergh, a political scientist at the Institute of Social Research in Oslo. ',\n",
       " 'WEST PALM BEACH, Fla./WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump plans to put his pick for Commerce Secretary, billionaire investor Wilbur Ross, in charge of his get-tough trade policy, a transition team spokesman said on Tuesday. It is a signal of how Trump, who is also interviewing candidates to be the U.S. Trade Representative (USTR), plans to elevate a crackdown on competitors in the world market and the overhaul of trade deals that he says have hurt U.S. factory jobs. The USTR will not be merged with Commerce, but Trump transition team spokesman Jason Miller made clear that most trade policy decisions would be steered by Ross, who made a good part of his fortune by investing in distressed steel companies that benefited from stiff import tariffs imposed by former President George W. Bush in the early 2000s. “Mr. Ross not only has negotiated some very good deals over his lifetime, he’s also the person who worked closely with the president-elect on crafting his trade policy over the administration,” Miller told reporters during a daily transition briefing. “Mr. Ross will be playing a big role in any trade particulars in this administration.” The move also marks a notable shift from trade policy management in President Barack Obama’s administration, where USTR Michael Froman was seen as the main trade architect, negotiating a 12-country Pacific Rim trade deal that ultimately failed to win approval in Congress.    “It looks like the USTR office is being downgraded and subordinated to Commerce,” said Derek Scissors, a trade expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a right-leaning think tank in Washington. “That’s a big change because USTR is this small elite trade agency right across from the White House.” Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, blamed multilateral trade deals with Mexico and China for the loss of U.S. jobs, a core message during his campaign, and said he would push to renegotiate the agreements. Trump’s administration is expected to crack down on Chinese trade practices with enforcement cases, which has raised fears Beijing would retaliate. He has also pledged to hit companies that shift production from the United States to other countries with a 35 percent tax on their exports into the United States — legislation he said his team would soon “write up.” Ross has also been a key adviser on another top Trump priority: a proposal to use tax credits to help spur $1 trillion of private and public spending on roads, bridges and other infrastructure. Trump plans to delegate coordination of that plan to the head of an infrastructure task force, the Washington Post reported on Tuesday, citing unnamed sources briefed on the plans. Trump has picked more than 20 nominees for his cabinet so far, packing his team with billionaires from the business world, retired generals, and loyalists. He is continuing to interview candidates for his cabinet this week at Mar-a-Lago, his Palm Beach resort, where he will spend the Christmas holiday — including potential picks for the USTR job. Elevating Ross’ role as Commerce Secretary could make the USTR job less attractive to potential candidates with top-tier trade expertise, said Scissors at the American Enterprise Institute. Traditionally, the USTR takes the lead on negotiations for trade deals, while Commerce, a massive sprawling agency, handles enforcement actions including anti-dumping and anti-subsidy investigations of low-cost imports.  On Tuesday, Trump was slated to meet about the USTR position with Jovita Carranza, who was deputy administrator with the Small Business Administration in the George W. Bush White House and a former executive with United Parcel Service Inc. Carranza, now a consultant, was part of a group of Hispanic leaders who met with Trump in July, after he had come under fire for his hard line on immigration and criticism of an Indiana-born Mexican-American federal judge. She became part of his campaign’s Hispanic advisory council and ran a call center from her home during the campaign to boost support for Trump among Hispanic voters in North Carolina, Miller said. Trump has also discussed the USTR job with Robert Lighthizer, a former deputy USTR during the Reagan administration, and Dan DiMicco, former CEO of steel producer Nucor Corp. In 2012, Obama proposed to combine Commerce and the USTR with the Small Business Administration, Export-Import Bank, Overseas Private Investment Corporation and U.S. Trade and Development Agency in one streamlined department — a plan that was rejected by Congress. Trump has no plans to merge Commerce with the USTR, Miller said. ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republicans will consider using planned tax reform to eliminate one of the biggest taxes in Obamacare, if the Senate fails to overturn the healthcare law, a senior Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives said on Wednesday.  Kevin Brady, the top Republican on tax policy in the House as chairman of the Ways and Means Committee, said Republicans will look at the 3.8 percent Net Investment Income Tax in discussions aimed at unveiling a tax reform plan in September. The levy is a weight on economic growth, he said in an interview with Reuters. Efforts by Republicans to overhaul or repeal the Affordable Care Act, known as Obamacare, collapsed in the Senate on Tuesday in a major setback for Republican President Donald Trump. Given a wholesale repeal or overhaul now seems imperiled, Republicans are looking at other ways to attack a law they have vowed to overturn since it was signed by Democratic former President Barack Obama seven years ago. Brady said tax legislation was unlikely to be able to include the repeal of other Obamacare taxes. Doing so would result in about $1 trillion in additional revenue losses over a decade, cutting into efforts to avoid adding to the federal deficit in the overall tax package, he said.  “Will we look at the Net Investment Income Tax provision? Yes, mainly because it is incredibly anti-growth the way it is today,” Brady said. But he was cautious about a full repeal of the tax, given the large revenues involved and the fact that some Senate Republicans resisted overturning it as part of the healthcare bill that was under consideration. The tax raises $172.2 billion in revenue over 10 years to fund Obamacare, including health insurance subsidies for individuals.  Its repeal is viewed by critics, including some moderate Republicans, as a tax cut for the wealthy since the tax hits individuals who earn more than $200,000 a year and married couples with more than $250,000 in earnings. Brady said he was most concerned about the investment tax’s effect on small businesses.  “It doesn’t just affect high earners. It goes across a broad spectrum of small business and captures too much of their activity as well. So we will take a look at that,” he said. However, he noted, “You’ve got to ask the question: if it couldn’t pass the Senate in healthcare, can it pass the Senate in tax reform?”  But he added: “Leaving that in place, from an economic standpoint, is a mistake.” ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell said on Thursday he had spoken with Myanmar s Aung San Suu Kyi and that she said she was working to get aid to the Rohingya Muslim areas in the Southeast Asian nation that were affected by violence. Suu Kyi  agreed with the need for immediate and improved access of humanitarian assistance to the region, particularly by the International Red Cross, and she conveyed that she is working toward that end,  McConnell said on the Senate floor. McConnell, whose Republicans control majorities in both houses of Congress, repeated earlier criticism of a resolution introduced in the U.S. Senate urging Suu Kyi to do more for Myanmar s ethnic minority Rohingya population, and lessening the chance that any such measure could pass. McConnell has had close ties to Suu Kyi for years. He said Suu Kyi, a Nobel prize laureate and de facto head of the government in Myanmar, also known as Burma, told him when they spoke on Wednesday that violations of human rights would need to be addressed. Attacks by Rohingya militants on security posts last month triggered an army operation that has killed more than 400 people, destroyed over 6,800 houses and sent nearly 400,000 Rohingya Muslims fleeing to Bangladesh. Suu Kyi has been a target of criticism from fellow Nobel laureates and religious leaders across the world for failing to condemn human rights abuses against the Rohingya during the military s fierce response to Rohingya militant attacks. The United Nations appealed Thursday for massive help for the nearly 400,000 who fled to Bangladesh, amid concern the number could keep rising unless Myanmar ends what critics denounce as  ethnic cleansing.  McConnell said Suu Kyi s position in the government was  exceedingly difficult  and that as a civilian, she had virtually no authority over the military. He warned that weakening her could interfere with the country s transition from decades of military rule. McConnell said he expected a briefing soon from Suu Kyi s office and that she was  trying very hard to improve conditions  for the Rohingya.  Burma s path to representative government is not at all certain and is certainly not over. And attacking the single political leader who has worked to further democracy within Burma is likely to hinder the objective over the long run,  McConnell concluded. ',\n",
       " 'MECCA (Reuters) - The imam of Mecca s Grand Mosque denounced those who  cause conflict among Muslims  in his last Friday sermon before the annual haj pilgrimage, as rifts widen among Gulf neighbors and wars rage across the Middle East. Saudi Arabia, which hosts and supervises the haj, has with other Arab governments imposed sanctions on Qatar and cut all transport links with the country in recent months, accusing it of supporting Iran and backing Islamist terrorism - charges Doha denies. Relations between Shi ite Muslim-led Iran and predominately Sunni Saudi Arabia are at their worst in years, with each accusing the other of subverting regional security and supporting opposite sides in conflicts in Syria, Iraq and Yemen.  Anyone who causes conflict and discord among Muslims ignores the blessing of harmony, imitates those who lived in ignorance (before Islam), harms his people and cheats his nation,  Sheikh Saleh Mohammed al-Taleb told the hundreds of thousands of pilgrims who have flocked to Mecca from around the world to perform the haj next week.  Taleb did not directly refer to the political and military divisions in the Arab world that have killed hundreds of thousands of people and displaced millions more in recent years. Nearly 90,000 Iranians are expected to attend, after Tehran boycotted Mecca last year following a crush at the pilgrimage in 2015 in which hundreds of people died, many of them Iranians. Saudi officials say over 400 Qatari pilgrims have also arrived through the land border in recent days, but Qatar has accused Saudi Arabia of deliberately making it hard for them. Saudi Arabia says Qatar is seeking to politicize the ritual for diplomatic gains. The dispute has defied mediation attempts by the United States and Kuwait. Worshippers on Friday filled the mosque s haram sanctuary, the holiest place in Islam, and spilled into nearby streets, malls, hotel lobbies and garages, listening to the sermon through loudspeakers. An elderly Tunisian pilgrim named Bakari Abdel Jalil attended in a white shirt and cap while other worshippers donned customary white robes. He said he hoped regional tensions would not affect the haj. ',\n",
       " 'MARACAIBO/CARACAS, Venezuela (Reuters) - The newly elected opposition governor of Venezuela s western Zulia state was dismissed on Thursday by the pro-government local state legislature, adding to disarray among foes of the ruling socialists.  The sacking of Juan Pablo Guanipa, one of five opposition governors in Venezuela s 23 states, came after he refused to swear loyalty to an all-powerful national legislative superbody aligned with President Nicolas Maduro s ruling socialists.   They held a secret, express session to remove him,  Guanipa s spokeswoman Erika Gutierrez told Reuters of the morning meeting of Zulia s state legislature.   Venezuela s opposition Democratic Unity coalition, which groups several dozen anti-Maduro parties, has been in crisis since a surprise defeat at this month s state elections. Despite polls showing it would win a comfortable majority due to widespread public anger over Venezuela s brutal economic crisis, the opposition only took five states compared to 18 for Maduro s Socialist Party candidates. Opposition leaders blamed dirty tricks by the government, including the last-minute moving of many vote centers in opposition areas, along with abstention by supporters disillusioned at the failure of protests earlier this year. Driving home its advantage, the government said only governors who recognize the supremacy of the pro-Maduro Constituent Assembly could take office.  Four opposition governors did that this week, sparking recriminations and bickering within the coalition, but Guanipa said he would never  kneel before the dictatorship.   This is an assault on the will of the people,  he tweeted after his removal on Thursday, denouncing a  coup  in the oil-rich state on the border with Colombia. OPPOSITION IN-FIGHTING Prior to this week, the opposition, along with various major foreign nations including the United States, had refused to recognize the Constituent Assembly.  Elected in July after four months of anti-Maduro protests, the body has overridden the opposition-run national congress.  One major opposition leader, Henrique Capriles, said he would no longer participate in the coalition while Henry Ramos, leader of the Democratic Action party whose four governors swore themselves in before the assembly, was a member. Capriles  Justice First party, and the Popular Will party of detained opposition leader Leopoldo Lopez, have called for a complete reformulation of the opposition grouping. Officials from Maduro down have been rubbing their hands in glee at the opposition implosion, and cheekily urging the controversial Ramos - a polarizing figure unpopular among young opposition militants - to stand for president in 2018.  Backstabbing has broken out in the opposition, all against all,  crowed Maduro earlier this week. The Constituent Assembly also announced on Thursday local mayoral elections would be held in December, giving the opposition a short time-frame to develop strategy.  Popular Will has already said it plans to boycott that vote. Young protesters, who saw hundreds of their fellow demonstrators jailed, injured or even killed in anti-Maduro street protests earlier this year, are disgusted by what for them is now a bleak political scenario. More than 125 people, including supporters of both sides plus security officials and bystanders, died in four months of unrest that Maduro said amounted to a U.S.-backed coup attempt.  Let the people continue speaking loud and clear in defense of peace, sovereignty and the sacred right to self-determination,  Constituent Assembly head Delcy Rodriguez said, announcing the December municipal vote that the socialists now expect to win handily given the opposition s disillusionment.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The U.S. military will fight Islamic State in Syria  as long as they want to fight,  Defense Secretary Jim Mattis said on Monday, describing a longer-term role for U.S. troops long after the insurgents lose all of the territory they control. As U.S.-backed and Russian-backed forces battle to retake the remaining pockets of Islamic State-held terrain, Mattis said the U.S. military s longer-term objective would be to prevent the return of an  ISIS 2.0.   The enemy hasn t declared that they re done with the area yet, so we ll keep fighting as long as they want to fight,  Mattis said, speaking to reporters at the Pentagon about the future of U.S. operations in Syria. He also stressed the importance of longer-term peace efforts, suggesting U.S. forces aimed to help set the conditions of a diplomatic solution in Syria, now in its seventh year of civil war.  We re not just going to walk away right now before the Geneva process has traction,  he added. U.S. President Donald Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin affirmed joint efforts to stabilize Syria as its civil war wanes, including with the expansion of a July 7 truce in the southwestern triangle bordering Israel and Jordan. Mattis said he believed the southwestern zone was working, and spoke hopefully about additional areas in the future that might allow for more refugees to return home.  You keep broadening them. Try to (demilitarize) one area then (demilitarize) another and just keep it going, try to do the things that will allow people to return to their homes,  he told reporters at the Pentagon. He declined to enter into specifics about any future zones.  Russia, which has a long-term military garrison in Syria, has said it wants foreign forces to quit the country eventually. Turkey said on Monday the United States had 13 bases in Syria and Russia had five. The U.S-backed Syrian YPG Kurdish militia has said Washington has established seven military bases in areas of northern Syria. The U.S.-led coalition says it does not discuss the location of its forces. One key aim for Washington is to limit Iranian influence in Syria and Iraq, which expanded during the war with Islamic State. ',\n",

       " 'You know things are going badly for the GOP President-Elect when even Fox News begins to turn on him. In an interview with Fox s Chris Wallace on Fox News Sunday, Trump was grilled about his conflicts of interest and about his similar accusations toward Hillary Clinton.Wallace asked Trump about his campaign manager, Kellyanne Conway, telling CNN that Trump would continue his role as executive producer for Celebrity Apprentice in his  spare time.  as well as the fact Trump plans on keeping a stake in his real estate business while in the White House.  Isn t that a huge conflict of interest, sir?  Wallace asked.Trump s response was that it was okay because everyone in the world knows he s a big real estate tycoon and he denied that he will be involved in the management of the company.To Wallace s credit (and I don t say that often), the Fox anchor countered that Trump  hammered Hillary Clinton over the Clinton Foundation and pay to play. Trump responded that that was  different because she takes massive amounts of money from foreign countries.  That s not true, but Fox didn t point that out.Wallace continued, noting that Trump will also be making  massive amounts of money  because  foreign countries are already booking events at the Trump hotel in D.C.,  and that Trump has  business operations, deals with foreign countries isn t this on steroids. Trump was seemingly appalled, but Wallace went on, saying that foreign governments were trying to curry favor with the United States through Trump s hotels.Trump, though, made the claim that he is  turning down billions of dollars in deals  because of potential conflicts of interest, but he did claim that he didn t know if he d be  doing deals,  and said that  under the law (he has) the right to do it,  but he doesn t want to.Here s the video:It s becoming increasingly clear that Trump is a danger, not just for domestic policy, but that he and his conflicts of interest present a real threat to the world. This issue is resonating with the American people, nearly 2/3rds of whom have expressed concern with Trump s conflicts of interest. As for why Fox is waking up to that reality now, and not before the election, well, perhaps they see it as their ticket out of a wildcard Trump presidency.

Russia used excessive force to storm a school in the small southern Russian town seized by Islamist militants in 2004, causing a high number of hostages to be killed, the court ruled in April. The three-day drama began when Islamist militants took more than 1,000 people hostages on the first day of the school year and called for independence for the majority-Muslim region of Chechnya. More than 330 hostages lost their lives, including at least 180 children, when the siege ended in a gun battle. It was the bloodiest incident of its kind in modern Russian history.     The case for damages was brought by 409 Russian nationals who either were taken hostage or injured in the incident, or were family members of those taken hostage, killed or injured, the European Court of Human Rights statement said in April. On Tuesday, the court said in a press release that its Grand Chamber Panel had rejected a Russian government request to refer the case and said its ruling was final.   No other actions are being contemplated by the participants in this process,  the Russian justice ministry said in comments carried by Interfax news agency.  In its April ruling, the court said the heavy-handed way Russian forces stormed the school had  contributed to the casualties among the hostages . It also ruled that authorities had failed to take reasonable preventive measures, despite knowing militants were planning to attack an educational institution. ',\n",

To be clear, we don t condone the abuse of any passenger on a paid flight by airport police, but we still believed there was more to the story than what was being shown in a video making the rounds on social media, that was taken by a passenger on the flight from Chicago to Louisville.We re wondering how long the United Airlines passengers would have put up with Dr. Dao s refusal to leave the plane before they became involved. After 1 or 2 hours of Dr. Dao s refusal to leave (even though he accepted to those terms when he agreed to fly with United), would the passengers have taken matters into their own hands after hours of listening to him refusing to leave?

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - The European Union and the United States on Wednesday reaffirmed support for Lebanon after the resignation of its prime minister, striking a sharp contrast to Saudi Arabia, which accuses Beirut of declaring war because of the Shi ite group Hezbollah. Statements of support from EU ambassadors to Lebanon and the United States have set a different tone to their Sunni Gulf ally Saudi Arabia, which has lumped Lebanon together with the Iran-backed Lebanese group Hezbollah as parties hostile to it. Lebanon has been pitched into deep crisis since the Saudi-allied Saad al-Hariri resigned on Saturday in a speech delivered from Saudi Arabia in which he accused Hezbollah and Iran of sowing strife in the Arab world and cited fear of assassination. The circumstances surrounding Hariri s sudden resignation have given rise to wide speculation that he had been caught up in a high-level anti-corruption purge in Saudi Arabia, where his family made their fortune, and coerced into resigning. Saudi Arabia has denied this along with reports that it has put Hariri under house arrest. It says he quit because Hezbollah was calling the shots in the government.    The move has pulled Lebanon back to the forefront of a regional struggle between the Sunni monarchy of Saudi Arabia and the Shi ite Islamist government of Iran, a rivalry which has also swept through Syria, Iraq, Bahrain and Yemen. It has plunged Lebanon into political crisis and hit market confidence in the heavily indebted Lebanese state. A sell off of Lebanese bonds continued for a third day on Wednesday, with some of them hitting their lowest ever levels.  The U.S. ambassador to Lebanon said on Wednesday the United States remained  committed to a stable, secure, democratic, and prosperous Lebanon  during a meeting with Lebanese army commander General Joseph Aoun, a U.S. embassy statement said. The meeting was to announce a U.S. government reimbursement of $42.9 million for border operations conducted by the Lebanese army, a major recipient of U.S. military aid. The United States classifies Hezbollah as a terrorist group even as it supports the weak Lebanese state, drawing a line between the two in a long-standing policy.  On Tuesday, the U.S. State Department said Lebanon was a strong U.S. partner.  The United States strongly supports the legitimate institutions in the Lebanese state,  spokeswoman Heather Nauert said.  We expect all members of the international community to respect fully those institutions and the sovereignty and political independence of Lebanon,  she said. In a statement, EU ambassadors to Lebanon said they reaffirmed  their strong support for the continued unity, stability, sovereignty, and security of Lebanon and its people . Lebanon has also received significant Western aid to help it cope with the strain of hosting 1.5 million Syrian refugees, equivalent to around a quarter of the population. Hezbollah, set up by the Iranian Revolutionary Guards in 1982, is the most powerful group in Lebanon, with major sway in government and a guerrilla army that outguns the national military. The group s role has grown beyond Lebanon in recent years, and its fighters have provided critical support to President Bashar al-Assad in the Syrian civil war. Neither Hezbollah nor the Lebanese government have responded to accusations made by Saudi Gulf affairs minister Thamer al-Sabhan that both Lebanon and Hezbollah had declared war on the kingdom. President Michel Aoun, a Hezbollah ally who took office last year, has refused to accept Hariri s resignation, saying he first wants him to return to Lebanon so he can meet him in person to understand the reasons. Aoun said Lebanon s security and economy were stable and the presidency still viewed Hariri as prime minister, Lebanese media reported. Parliament Speaker Nabih Berri has said the coalition government led by Hariri still stands.  Lebanese policymakers and bankers say there is no concern for the Lebanese pound - which has been pegged against the U.S. dollar at the same rate for two decades - thanks to record levels of foreign currency reserves. Banking sources say there was more demand than usual for converting Lebanese pound savings into dollars when banks opened on Monday. But they said this was not unexpected and is at minimal levels.  Lebanon s June 2020 bond, and its April 2020 issue both fell to their lowest ever levels on Wednesday.  Yields could come down, if a new Prime Minister is found quickly and the government can get back to business, but this doesn t appear to be likely in the short term,  said Carmen Altenkirch, emerging market sovereign analyst at Axa Investment Managers. Byblos Bank s Chief Economist Nassib Ghobril said:  We ve had worse cases when we saw pressure on the actual peg of Lebanese pound to U.S. dollar but it takes a severe shock of the magnitude of the (former Prime Minister Rafik al-Hariri) assassination in 2005 or the 2006 Israeli war to put real pressure on the currency peg.

       " 'Right-ing paranoid whackjob Pat Boone has declared SNL is now venerating Satan, because of a parody skit they ran called  God is a Boob Man.  The skit was making some light-hearted humor at recent attempts to pass anti-LGBT laws in many states. The skit is absolutely hilarious and is a parody of other recent Christian movie trailers for such films as  God s not dead. It isn t clear how Boone saw the skit since he clearly hates SNL and shouldn t be watching it as a result. Perhaps he watches it just to get outraged. He certainly did get upset, though, when he took it upon himself to Godsplain God to the rest of us:God is not thin-skinned. But he does demand reverence. If you have any brains at all you don t pitch yourself against someone who created all things, the God of the Bible. They don t have to apologize to Christians [but] when you come against God and the Holy Spirit who are one and the same, you are bringing upon yourself eternal condemnation. Source: Right Wing WatchBoone went on to not only accuse SNL of being supporters of Satan, but he also outed SNL as a secret Jew-hating enterprise as well: Something can be devilishly funny, but this skit is diabolical. God has only one real enemy   Satan. Satan ridicules faith, and they re taking Satan s side. They re also ridiculing me and the film, telling impressionable young people not to see it because it s ridiculous. Then they throw in that the lawyer is Jewish to make the Christian look even worse, but it s just anti-Semitic. Source: Fox NewsYeah, he sure nailed it. Saturday Night Live is secretly anti-Jew. Just think about how stupid that sounds for a few moments.Then, to prove that he s a couple cans short of a six-pack, Boone said he didn t feel that SNL needed to apologize to Christians  followed a few moments later by him demanding that SNL apologizes to Christians. He literally real-time flip-flopped.Boone even went so far as to suggest that gay people should be offended at SNL for being  portrayed as more bigoted than Christians.  Notice he said  more  bigoted. He literally admitted that Christians like him are bigoted, by using the word  more. As if this wasn t embarrassing enough, the producer of  God s Not Dead 2,  (they actually made 2 of these?) Michael Scott, also complained that SNL is not portraying his movie  accurately  proving that he has absolutely NO CLUE how parody or satire works.Scott also chimed in with another incredibly funny comment, saying that parody like the SNL skit  goes too far  and  can cause divisions  among us.Really? Anti-LGBT/Pro-discrimination law doesn t go too far, and bigoted irrational hate doesn t cause divisions. But, a parody skit on SNL is the great doom of humanity. You really couldn t intentionally make up something that sounds as stupid as the things fundie Christians say naturally, these days.Featured image via Fox News screen capture',\n",
       " 'The Republican Party is busy with a pitted civil war between those who are willing to jump on Trump s crazy train, and those who realize the party has to be saved from the ultra-conservative extremism which handed a trust fund tycoon the party leadership. But as the Daily Show attempted to report events this week, things were so crazy, the team couldn t keep a straight face.Noah begins by outlining the GOP dilemma. Now the voting is over, and Republicans have chosen a mutant from a carrot juicing accident. As the party wakes up to that devastating reality, the GOP is splitting along the Trump fault line. Noah describes their plight with typical relish: You ve got the people who support Trump. You ve got the people who aren t ready to support Trump. And the most interesting people are a group who spent the whole race throwing sh*t at Trump. And now, they re picking it back up, spreading it on a sandwich, and taking a big bite. The host then shows clips of come-lately Trump supporters railing against the candidate in the most personal and vivid terms earlier in the race. Bobby Jindal calls Trump  weak  and a  narcissist,  and claims he would not back him in the event of his becoming nominee. But the real gold comes from Rick Perry, who refers to Trump as a  cancer  on the party and America, then chooses to back him. But even more insane, is that Perry now even wishes to become Trump s running mate! This left Noah almost tearful with laughter: So wait  he says.  You want to be running mates with cancer? That s what you re saying? I mean, I guess it has a pretty sturgeon history of winning .but still! Noah goes on to compare the GOP split like that of commuters waiting for a subway train. The doors open, and there s some crazy guy screaming. For some they think, well, it s my train, I m just going to have to  get on board the crazy train.  While others simply refuse, and to hell with the consequences.But when Noah reaches out to his correspondents for their take on the situation, no one can keep a straight face. Jordan Klepper collapses laughing, saying: They were all such assholes for so long and they completely did this to themselves! Noah turns to Hasan Minhaj in hopes of getting more sensible commentary, but he also falls apart when comparing the GOP to  a dog that chewed its own balls off.

       " 'LISBON (Reuters) - A women s rights group has called a rally to protest against a Portuguese court ruling that upheld a light sentence for a woman s attackers on the grounds they may have been driven to it by her adultery, an offence punishable with death in the Bible.  Judges Neto de Moura and Maria Luisa Arantes rejected the prosecutors  appeal to toughen the suspended sentence and fine, saying the  depressive state  of the two defendants - the woman s former husband and her former lover - was a mitigating factor.     We read in the Bible that an adulteress should be punished with death,  the judges in the Porto Court of Appeal wrote. They also referenced the  symbolic sentences  given to men who murdered adulterous wives in the late 19th century in Portugal.  These references are merely intended to stress that the society has always strongly condemned adultery by a woman and therefore sees the violence by a betrayed, humiliated man with some understanding,  they wrote in their Oct. 11 verdict. The UMAR Women s Union for Alternative and Response called the verdict in Portugal s second-largest city  revolting  and said it perpetuated  the ideology of victim-blaming .   Evoking the Bible does not combine with the rule of law in our country and discredits the judicial norms,  UMAR said in a statement. In the 2015 attack, one of the men assaulted and held the victim while the other attacked her with a nail-spiked club. Her injuries were not life-threatening. Both were convicted and sentenced to pay large fines in addition to suspended time in prison of about a year each. UMAR and the feminist movement Por Todas Nos (For all of Us Women) called a protest rally in downtown Lisbon for Friday. Protests were also called in Porto under the slogan  Male chauvinism is not justice, but crime . Ultra-orthodox patriarchy - one of the cornerstones of the fascist dictatorship of Antonio Salazar up until the 1974 revolution - still survives in parts of Portugal.  ',\n",

       " 'Donald Trump s bigoted anti-Muslim rhetoric has inspired his equally hateful followers to hold all sorts of bigotry-inspired events to show just how much they hate everyone who isn t a die hard right-wing Christian. Case in point- one Jim Stachowiak who held an armed, open carry event to protest Muslims at the Georgia Capitol, which he dubbed United against Islam and Islamic immigration refugee. He encouraged attendees to come bearing as many arms as they like, and their intended activities included ripping up photos of President Obama, Hillary Clinton, Loretta Lynch, and the Prophet Mohammed. If that isn t offensive enough for you, Stachowiak also intended to rip up a Qu ran.This bigot s so-called rally was an epic fail, though. Guess how many people besides the rally s organizers showed up? ONE. Yep, you read that right. Only one person showed up to the hate rally, when originally there was going to be a supposed 200 people in attendance. The people at the Capitol took what Stachowiak was doing seriously, and rightly so, since Stachowiak is a known right-wing gun nut. According to The Daily Beast:The right-wing agitator has been calling on the government to  STOP MUSLIM IMMIGRATION  for years, loves brandishing his large firearms, and wants you to know that  JESUS CHRIST WAS NOT A PACIFIST. He also enjoys referring to himself as a well-armed, proud  crusader  and  infidel  against the forces of  Islam, and any other Satanic Death Cult that would destroy our Liberty. Capitol Police Chief Lewis G. Young warned people who would have the misfortune of having to work near this insane demonstration that rally participants would liked have a bunch of guns. His warning also said: DPS is currently monitoring the threat risk and, together with GBA, is taking precautions to make Capitol Hill a safe environment. However, it was all for naught, because there was, according the social media evidence, one lone idiot out there at the Capitol protesting Muslims by himself.

       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - Prime Minister Theresa May s blueprint for Britain s exit from the European Union faces a crucial test starting on Tuesday, when lawmakers try to win concessions from a weakened leader on the government s legislation to sever ties. It is yet another battle for May after scandals and gaffes that have brought questions about her leadership into the open. As many as 40 of her lawmakers would support a no-confidence motion against her, according to the Sunday Times newspaper. But many sources in her governing Conservative Party say now is not the time to force her out because despite backing Britain remaining in the EU, even if reluctantly, they think she is still the best option to deliver Brexit. That makes the debates over EU withdrawal bill all the more important as a test of her ability to steer through legislation she says is crucial to give companies confidence that the rules will not change when Britain leaves in March 2019. With the power balanced in favor of lawmakers rather than the government after the Conservatives lost their majority in a June election, many - even within the party - will use the debate over coming weeks to put the pressure on.   We have no intention of parliament being a bystander, we are a key participant in this process,  said Hilary Benn, a lawmaker from the opposition Labour Party who is chair of the Brexit parliamentary committee.  In the end we are going to have to vote on the final deal, and the outcome of the election and the balance of votes in the House of Commons now really does bring that home,  he told the Institute for Government thinktank earlier this month.  The public debate in parliament on Tuesday is the first of eight to discuss the bill before it goes on to other legislative stages. The schedule will be determined by the House of Commons  over the course of the debates.  Lawmakers have proposed 186 pages of amendments to the bill, which largely  copy and paste  EU rules and regulations into British law but also, critics say, hand the government wide-ranging powers and cut parliament out of some Brexit planning. The bill is separate from negotiations going on in Brussels, but the EU will want to see how many and which amendments are passed and will regard the showdown as a test of May s strength at home. May is under pressure to make progress with the EU at a summit in December after growing European frustration over Britain s refusal to say how much it thinks it should pay to leave. The amendments include one to stop the government from adopting the so-called Henry VIII powers, named after the 16th century monarch who ruled by proclamation, which allow the government to amend laws being transposed from EU law. Other amendments address criticism that parliament will not get a  meaningful vote  on the deal eventually agreed with the EU, and press the government to enshrine in law the EU protections Britons now enjoy such as workers rights and environmental protections. May s government has taken some of the fire out of the proposed challenges by signaling it is willing to bend on the Henry VIII powers, and on Monday, her Brexit minister David Davis said parliament would be offered a new vote on the final Brexit deal.  The first debate will cover the part of the bill that repeals the 1972 European Communities Act on the retention, conversion and interpretation of existing EU laws, and EU rights.  Getting parliamentary scrutiny is a winner. The government will change position because it doesn t want a defeat,  said one Conservative lawmaker, speaking on condition of anonymity. But other issues, such as the push for a vote in parliament on the EU deal which could force the government back to the negotiating table, or even possibly overturn Brexit, present huge challenges. The debate comes at a new low point for May since she was made prime minister after Britain voted for Brexit last June.  She has lost two ministers in a week, and her foreign minister, Boris Johnson, is under pressure from the opposition to resign over comments about a jailed aid worker in Iran, a case further complicated at the weekend by Gove, his ally.     On Monday, Keir Starmer, the Brexit spokesman for the Labour Party, launched a new bid to derail the withdrawal legislation, saying May s policy to end the jurisdiction of the EU court - the European Court of Justice - was incompatible with her own policy for a smooth transition after Brexit.  Over recent weeks, it has become increasingly clear that you alone do not have the authority to deliver a transitional deal with Europe and to take the necessary steps to protect jobs and the economy,  he wrote in an open letter to May.

Rosenworcel went even further when she was questioned about Trump s suggestions that the First Amendment should somehow be impeded from the bully pulpit of the White House: I think it s important to realize that the Supreme Court characterizes our First Amendment as a profound national commitment to having robust, uninhibited and wide open debate and you know, that debate can sometimes be hard hitting for public officials.

       " '(Reuters) - Within a few weeks of winning the White House, President-elect Donald Trump could face another group of U.S. citizens, a federal jury in California, courtesy of a lawsuit by former students of his now-defunct Trump University who claim they were defrauded by a series of real-estate seminars. A hearing in federal court in San Diego is set for Thursday, and the trial is scheduled to begin on Nov. 28, barring any delays or if Trump decides to settle the case.    While presidents enjoy immunity from lawsuits arising from their official duties, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that this shield does not extend to acts alleged to have taken place prior to taking office. The 1997 ruling came in the sexual harassment lawsuit filed against President Bill Clinton by Paula Jones, which was settled before it went to trial.  Lawyers said they could think of no similar situation like the one now involving Trump. “I’m certain there is nothing comparable to this,” said    Alan Dershowitz, professor emeritus at Harvard Law School.  Lawyers for both Trump and the plaintiffs declined to comment on Wednesday. Dershowitz said the Supreme Court also held that a case cannot be delayed just because the defendant is president, though judges are still free to grant reasonable delays to any party. Miami trial consultant Sandy Marks, who is not involved in the case, said he thought Trump might ask the presiding judge, Gonzalo Curiel, to postpone the trial in an effort to settle the case before taking office. “I think the judge would be foolhardy not to give him a short (delay),” said Marks, “which would give him a chance to resolve the case with all these people and put it behind him.” Trump repeatedly claimed on the campaign trail that he would win the lawsuit, and he accused Curiel of being biased against him because of his campaign promise to build a wall along the border with Mexico. The judge was born in Indiana to Mexican parents. At the hearing on Thursday, lawyers will argue pre-trial motions, including one by Trump to block potential jurors from hearing comments made or publicized during the campaign, such as those about the judge. Lawyers for the students have argued the comments could help jurors assess Trump’s credibility as a witness. Trump is listed as defense witness in the case and could be called to testify by the plaintiffs as well. He was previously deposed by the students’ lawyers.  Claims against Trump over the seminars date to 2010, with two class actions filed in federal court in San Diego and another case brought by New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on behalf of students who claim they were misled into paying as much as $35,000 each to learn worthless real estate investing “secrets” from instructors “hand-picked” by Trump. Trump has admitted he did not hand-pick instructors, but has argued the claim was marketing language not meant to be taken literally. He claims most students were happy with their courses.  If the trial goes forward, several legal experts said it would be hard to seat an impartial jury, since so many people already have strong opinions about the president-elect. Parties often hire specialized jury consultants to pick jurors, but New York lawyer Robert Anello said they were not infallible. “If experienced pollsters can’t get it right,” he said, “how can a jury consultant who is not spending as much time studying the demographics?” In an interview a day before the election, Jeffrey Goldman, a lawyer for Trump in the New York case, said the media’s “drumbeat of distortion” about Trump University would make it hard to find impartial jurors. Several experts noted that jurors, who will answer a questionnaire in addition to being questioned by the lawyers and the judge, are generally taken at their word when they say they can be impartial. Boston jury consultant Edward Schwartz said he expects both sides to make an effort to vet jurors by their public social media postings. Dershowitz noted that San Diego, though located in deep-blue California, is not as politically monolithic as, say, San Francisco. It has an ethnically diverse population and also has a large military presence. “This is a jury consultant’s nightmare to pick in a case like this,” said Dershowitz. “It will be taught in jury consulting school.” ',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - U.S. demands for more favorable treatment under the North American Free Trade Agreement, and a proposal that any new deal be allowed to expire after five years, heightened tensions as negotiators held another round of talks to renew the pact this week. NAFTA, long opposed by U.S. President Donald Trump, was  first implemented in 1994. It eliminates most tariffs on trade between the United States, Canada and Mexico and underpins $1 trillion of trade. Key issues facing negotiators include: U.S. Commerce Secretary Wilbur Ross says the United States is seeking to add a so-called sunset clause to NAFTA to provide a regular, “systematic re-examination” of the trade pact. The provision, causing NAFTA to expire after five years unless all three countries decide to renew it, has been met with disbelief by Canada, Mexico and the U.S. Chamber of Commerce. They say a major reason for having a trade deal is to provide investors with certainty about the future. The United States wants U.S. parts to be make up at least 50 percent of the content of autos made in North America, and parts from the region to make up at least 85 percent of the vehicles.  At present cars must contain at least 62.5 percent American, Canadian or Mexican content. Canada, Mexico and the auto industry warn that such strict rules will drive automakers to make their vehicles elsewhere, or buy cheap Asian parts and pay the tariffs. The United States has sought to ditch the so-called Chapter 19 tool, under which binational panels hear complaints about illegal subsidies and dumping and then issue binding decisions. Washington argues that Chapter 19 infringes on the sovereignty of its domestic laws. Canada has said Chapter 19 can be updated, but that a dispute settlement mechanism has to be part of any updated NAFTA. Mexico also says dispute settlement mechanisms are a vital part of the deal and give investors security. Quotas are already a feature of NAFTA in several agricultural commodities including dairy and sugar, but Washington is seeking to eliminate non-tariff barriers to U.S. agricultural exports. Dairy was excluded from the original 1994 NAFTA deal, and U.S. President Donald Trump has called Canada’s restrictions on dairy imports a “disgrace.” The United States is pushing for the Canadian and Mexican governments to open up their tender processes to U.S.-made products, but at the same time it is defending existing “Buy American” procurement laws under a proposal dubbed “Dollar for Dollar.” The Buy American provisions have blocked the use of Canadian steel to build U.S. bridges, and Canada is pushing for a freer market for government procurement. The United States is exploring ways to protect fresh fruit and vegetable farmers in Florida and Georgia by giving small growers easier access to anti-dumping measures, a move Mexico sees as anti-free trade. It is also opposed by larger U.S. farm outfits that use their Mexican fields to sell cheap berries and tomatoes to U.S. consumer all year round under NAFTA. INVESTOR-STATE DISPUTE SETTLEMENT The United States has proposed a minor tweaking of the NAFTA Chapter 11 provisions, designed to ensure that firms that invest abroad receive “fair and equitable” treatment by foreign governments. Opponents of the provisions argue they infringe on sovereignty and benefit multinational corporations. Canada wants to update the mechanism to allow governments to regulate in the interest of the environment or labor, as in the Comprehensive Economic and Trade Agreement that Canada recently negotiated with the European Union. Mexico’s Economy Minister Ildefonso Guajardo last week criticized a U.S. proposal he said was aimed at putting new restrictions on companies that do deals with Mexico’s state-run energy companies. In 2014, Mexico opened its energy sector to private investment and says it has since raised at least $60 billion in investment commitments. ',\n",

       " 'BERLIN (Reuters) - German Chancellor Angela Merkel appointed Jan Hecker, her refugee policy coordinator, as her new foreign policy adviser, as she braced for tricky talks on a new coalition government next week, where immigration is likely to be a key issue, a government spokeswoman said. Merkel, humbled in last month s national election by a surge of the anti-immigrant far right, is seeking to put together a three-way coalition of her conservatives, the pro-business Free Democrats and the environmentalist Greens - a combination previously untested at the federal level. Members of her conservative bloc resolved their own differences and agreed to limiting migration on Monday, paving the way for talks to begin with the other parties. Hecker, a former federal judge, took over the newly created position of refugee coordinator in October 2015 after Merkel s decision to allow in over a million migrants. He led Germany s migration treaties with African states and accompanied Merkel on a number of foreign trips focused on migration. The decision reflects  growing awareness that refugee and asylum policies are inextricably linked to security issues,  said Judy Dempsey, a senior fellow at Carnegie Europe.  He had the overview of Libya, of the traffickers, of the security of the borders, of the agreement with Turkey,  she said. Hecker replaces Christoph Heusgen, who had advised Merkel for all 12 years of her role as chancellor, before becoming Germany s U.N. ambassador in New York in late July. With Hecker s appointment, Merkel breaks for the second time with a longstanding tradition of tapping diplomats to fill foreign and political jobs in the chancellery. ',\n",
       " 'BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraqi Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi ordered a 24-hour suspension to military operations against Kurdish forces in northern Iraq, to allow for the peaceful deployment of Iraqi troops at the border crossings with the Kurdistan region. A Kurdish spokesman earlier said the two sides reached an agreement on Friday to stop fighting which broke out on Oct. 16, after Iraqi forces seized the oil-city of Kirkuk. Abadi ordered the offensive on Kirkuk and other Kurdish-held territory in retaliation to the Sept. 25 vote for independence in a referendum organized by the Kurdistan Regional Government (KRG) - a drive that was all but crushed by the surprise attack. The 24-hour truce  should allow a joint technical committee ... to work on the deployment of federal Iraqi forces in all disputed areas, including Fish-Khabur, and the international border , Abadi said in a statement.   This should prevent bloodshed between the children of the same country.  He wants to take control of border crossings with neighboring countries, including one in the Fish-Khabur area through which an oil export pipeline crosses into Turkey, carrying Iraqi and Kurdish crude oil. The KRG on Wednesday proposed an immediate ceasefire, a suspension of the referendum result and  starting an open dialogue with the federal government based on the Iraqi constitution  - call rejected by Baghdad.     According to the KRG, which is based in the Kurdish autonomous region s capital of Erbil, the ceasefire entered effect at 1 a.m. on Friday (2200 GMT Thursday).  The ceasefire is holding,  Vahal Ali, the director of KRG  President Masoud Barzani s media office, told Reuters.  U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson has also urged dialogue to start, in a call to Abadi, the Iraqi central government said in a statement on Friday morning. U.S.-backed Iraqi government forces, Iranian-backed paramilitaries and Kurdish fighters fought alongside each other to defeat Islamic State, also called ISIS, but the alliance has faltered with the militants largely defeated in the country. The multi-ethnic city of Kirkuk, which lies outside the KRG official boundaries, fell to Iraqi forces without much resistance on Oct. 16 but the Kurdish Peshmerga began to fight back as they withdrew closer to the core of the Kurdish region. The fall of Kirkuk, considered by many Kurds as the heart of their fatherland, was a major symbolic and financial blow to the Kurdish drive for independence championed by Barzani, as it halved the region s oil export revenue.  The most violent clashes happened in the northwestern corner as the Peshmerga fought back offensives toward Fish-Khabur, and also south of their capital Erbil, leaving dozens of casualties on both sides. Speaking in Geneva on Thursday, Tillerson said he was  disappointed that the parties have been unable to reach an entirely peaceful resolution  and that he had encouraged Abadi to accept the KRG  overtures for talks on the basis of the Iraqi constitution . Abadi demanded on Thursday that the Kurds declare their referendum void, rejecting the KRG offer to suspend its independence push to resolve a crisis through talks.  We won t accept anything but its cancellation and the respect of the constitution,  he said in a statement during a visit to Tehran. The spokesman of the U.S.-led anti Islamic State coalition in Baghdad, U.S. Colonel Ryan Dillon, told Reuters:  Both parties are talking with one another, but it is not an official ceasefire.   In an interview with Kurdish TV Rudaw, Dillon called on the two sides to extend the deal to a complete halt in hostility and  refocus our efforts on defeating ISIS .  We are encouraging dialogue, we are trying to get the tensions down,  he added. Iraqi forces on Thursday launched an offensive to recapture the last patch of Iraqi territory still in the hands of Islamic State, on the border area with Syria. Abadi has expressed hope the group will be completely defeated in Iraq before the end of the year. The militant group also holds parts of the Syrian side of the border, but the area under their control is shrinking as they retreat in the face of two sets of hostile forces - a U.S.-backed, Kurdish-led coalition and Syrian government troops with foreign Shi ite militias backed by Iran and Russia. Islamic State s self-declared cross-border caliphate effectively collapsed in July, when U.S.-backed Iraqi forces captured Mosul, the group s de facto capital in Iraq, in a gruelling battle which lasted nine months. The militants  Syrian stronghold, Raqqa, fell to U.S.-backed forces earlier this month. Islamic State leader Abu Bakr al-Baghdadi, who declared the caliphate from Mosul in mid-2014, released an audio recording on Sept. 28 that indicated he was alive, after several reports he had been killed.

Organizers said the gathering was Australia s largest gay rights demonstration, as a diverse range of people clad in rainbow colors converged on the heart of the city to insist on equal rights.  We re blown away by the response,  Cat Rose from Community Action Against Homophobia said.  The force we ve shown today puts us in a good stead to win this battle over the next couple of months.       Though the postal ballot is non-binding, a  yes  vote is expected to lead to the legalization of same-sex marriage which could further fracture the government of Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull. Ballots will be mailed out from Sept. 12, with a result expected some time in November. The country s Opposition Leader, Bill Shorten, said it was the law that had to change, not the gay community.  We ve got one last mountain to climb  before we make marriage equality a reality. Let s climb it together, today,  he said. Turnbull, who has said he will be voting in support of same-sex marriage, told a gathering of the Liberal and National parties  faithful on Sunday that the issue was one where everyone is entitled to an opinion.  Many people will vote  yes , as I will, because they believe the right to marry is a conservative ideal as much as any other principle,  he said. His words were in contrast to those of one of his party s previous leaders, former prime minister John Howard, who officially launched the  no  campaign on Saturday. Howard said in a statement on the website of the Coalition for Marriage that there could not be changes to social institutions without wider consequences.  I believe there is a conflict here between those seeking the right for same-sex marriage and the rights of the child, and I believe the right of the child to have a mother and father should be preserved,  he said. The coalition, the lead campaigner against same-sex marriage, did not respond to requests for comment. It includes the Australian Christian Lobby and the Greek Orthodox Archdiocese of Australia.   However,  yes  campaigner Kerryn Phelps, the former chief of the Australian Medical Association, said the survey was about unifying the nation.   What we want is to see Australians united in marriage equality and united in fairness for all Australians,  she said. Rally attendees Stephen Madden, 55, and David Long, 47, have been together for 21 years and want to get married.   We ve had the world s longest engagement,  Long said.  My mum would really like to have a legal son-in-law,  Madden added. The Sydney event followed a similar rally in Melbourne last month which organizers said was attended by 15,000 people. Police declined to comment on the numbers at both rallies.  Australia is one of the only developed English-speaking countries not to have legalised same-sex marriage, despite strong popular support and the backing of a majority of lawmakers.  ',\n",
       " ' (This January 3 story was corrected to remove reference in paragraph 8 to ConocoPhillips, which is not an integrated oil company) By David Morgan WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Big Oil could be in a unique position to protect its interests against a Republican proposal to tax imports, given that President-elect Donald Trump’s cabinet is studded with oil champions sensitive to the risk of higher gasoline prices.    Trump’s emerging leadership includes Exxon Mobil Corp Chief Executive Officer Rex Tillerson as secretary of state, former Texas Governor Rick Perry as energy secretary and  Oklahoma Attorney General Scott Pruitt as Environmental Protection Agency administrator. Trump himself has made no secret of his support for the energy sector.  And in Congress, both Republicans and Democrats have close industry ties, including House tax panel chairman Kevin Brady, a Texas Republican whose district takes in the northern Houston suburbs. House Republicans want to adopt a sweeping tax reform that would sharply reduce tax rates for corporations and end the taxation of U.S. corporate overseas profits.  But a provision known as border adjustability is stirring up controversy. Though intended to boost U.S. manufacturing by exempting export revenues from tax, the provision worries some industries because it would also tax imports. Because U.S. oil refiners import about half the crude oil they use to make gasoline, diesel and other products, analysts say the change could lead to higher gasoline prices and potentially undermine economic growth. Integrated oil companies such as Exxon, Chevron Corp, BP Plc and Royal Dutch Shell Plc could also be hit, depending on whether they are net importers.   But the industry’s allies would likely move to soften any rough edges, analysts say.  “I don’t see this mix of leadership figures in the House, Senate and the White House, doing something that has the effect of raising gasoline prices,” said Peter Cohn, an energy analyst with Height Securities, a Washington-based investment firm. The danger is that a move to protect the oil refiners could open the door to assistance for other industries, including retailers and automakers, which would also face higher costs if no longer able to deduct the cost of imports from their taxable income. Such a knock-on effect could prevent border adjustability from raising an expected $1 trillion in revenues to help pay for lower tax rates over the next decade.      “We hope that raising these concerns early in the process will allow members of Congress to consider the issues carefully,” Chet Thompson, president of the American Fuel and Petrochemical Manufacturers trade group, said in a statement. Brady said earlier this month that his committee was sensitive to the impact on specific businesses and “listening very closely to how we can make sure we smooth that out.” Moreover, some economists dismiss industry worries about higher import costs, saying the dollar’s value would rise in response to such sweeping tax changes and ultimately reduce the cost of imports. Currency markets would adjust to higher oil prices by lowering the dollar value of crude, they predict. “This argument by the oil industry is, frankly, all wrong,” said Douglas Holtz-Eakin, former director of the nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, who now heads the American Action Forum think tank. “Refiners are going to be basically held harmless. They’ll have a lower dollar price of oil. Net cost is the same. And they go about their business. I’m unsympathetic,” he added. Height Securities’ Cohn said Trump and his advisers could look for ways to soften any blow to refiners and their customers: “Trump doesn’t want to have refineries closing on his watch.”  Oil already benefits from several tax code provisions in place for decades that would be eliminated under the House Republican plan. But they stand to gain more than they will lose. For instance, an existing tax deduction for domestic production lets oil producers shave down their corporate tax rate to 32 percent from the top headline rate of 35 percent. Under the congressional Republicans’ plan, the corporate rate would be cut to 20 percent; under Trump’s plan, to 15 percent. Similarly, companies that now write off intangible drilling costs or get a tax allowance for asset depletion would be able to immediately expense capital investments.  Then there is a tax credit oil companies claim for fees from foreign countries. Congressional Republicans would eliminate foreign taxes altogether, while Trump would maintain taxation at a substantially lower rate. ',\n",
       " 'REYKJAVIK (Reuters) - Icelanders, angry over a string of political scandals, ousted their center-right government in an election that could pave the way for a charismatic young opposition leader to form a left-leaning coalition, final vote counts showed on Sunday. With the defeat of incumbent Prime Minister Bjarni Benediktsson s coalition government, his main opponent, the Left-Green Movement s Katrin Jakobsdottir, is likely to get a chance to form a narrow majority in parliament. Still, the composition of any coalition government remained uncertain, as the president had not yet mandated a party to form one. The Nordic island of 340,000 people, one of the countries hit hardest by the 2008 financial crisis, has staged a remarkable economic rebound spurred by a tourism boom. Benediktsson called the snap election in September, after less than a year in government, as a scandal involving his father prompted the Bright Future party to drop out of his ruling coalition, citing a breach of trust. The previous government was defeated last year following revelations in the Panama Papers about then-Prime Minister Sigmundur David Gunnlaugsson s use of offshore tax havens. In addition to the political scandals, a growing sense of inequality and unease about immigration in one of the world s most ethnically homogeneous nations have rattled a democracy known for its political and social stability. After the final vote count, Jakobsdottir, 41, of the Left-Greens stood to gain a narrow majority in parliament with three other opposition parties. The result showed a Left-Green-led coalition was possible if they joined forces with the Social Democrats, the Progressive Party and the Pirate Party. Together, they would hold 32 of parliament s 63 seats.   The opposition has a majority, so that s a message. But we ve also talked about that maybe things should be done differently and create a broader government,  Jakobsdottir said in a TV debate on Sunday. The Left-Greens want to reduce inequality and fund an increase in public health care, education and infrastructure spending by raising taxes for the wealthy and introducing a property tax.  The parliament will be split among eight parties. There are two new parties, and one of the parties in the current tri-party government failed to get enough votes to remain in parliament. The Independence Party, the main partner in the current government coalition, lost 4 percentage points from last year s election to take 25 percent of the vote. It remains the biggest party, but the election was the worst since 2009 for a party that has dominated Iceland s politics for decades, getting support of as much as 40 percent of voters. Asked during the TV debate if the Independence Party would get the chance to form a new government, Benediktsson said:  I think so. We are the biggest party, and I think it s normal that we should be a part of a future government.  We are attacked as a party that bears responsibility for certain things,  he said.  We are in a new environment, and considering that I am happy with the result.  His party wants to reduce the national debt and cut taxes on individuals and businesses.  The Left-Greens came in second with 17 percent, up 1 percentage point from last year s election, and its probable ally the Social Democrats in third with 12 percent, almost doubling its share.  I think that the opposition with one extra party can create a really strong government,  said Social Democrat leader Logi Einarsson, hinting at the possibility of a five-party government. The new Centre Party, which was formed in September by former Prime Minister Gunnlaugsson, won 11 percent of the votes. The Pirate Party, which last year rode a wave of anger against the establishment to become the third biggest party in parliament, stood to get 9 percent of votes in Saturday s election down from 14 percent last year.

       " 'DETROIT (Reuters) - Two former Michigan representatives forced out of the state legislature last fall for a scheme to cover up their extramarital affair face felony charges of misconduct and related counts, officials said on Friday. Todd Courser, who resigned from his seat in Lapeer County, was charged with three counts of misconduct while in office, each of which carries a five year prison term, as well as a perjury charge, which has a 15-year sentence, according to the Michigan attorney general’s office. Cindy Gamrat, who was removed from her Allegan County seat, faces two charges of misconduct while in office. Warrants have been served for both former lawmakers. “We are demonstrating to the citizens of Michigan that no one is above the law, not even those who walk in the hall of power,” Attorney General Bill Schuette told reporters. Schuette’s office and Michigan State Police launched an investigation into the two disgraced lawmakers last fall. Schuette said on Friday that Courser and Gamrat both lied to investigators, and that Courser asked his staff to send out false emails to cover up the extramarital affair. Courser had devised a plan to distribute an email falsely claiming he had sex with a male prostitute, according to the Detroit News. That claim, Courser said, would have blunted the political impact of an actual affair if it had come out. He was charged with perjury for allegedly lying while giving testimony to a House committee, Schuette’s office said. Both won seats in 2014 as Tea Party conservatives and devout Christians. They tried to regain their seats last year, but lost in the Republican primary. Courser and Gamrat were not immediately available for comment on Friday. ',\n",
       " 'RABAT (Reuters) - Fifteen people were killed and five more injured when a stampede broke out in a southwestern Moroccan town on Sunday as food aid was being distributed in a market, the Interior Ministry said. A hospital source put the death toll at 18, adding that most victims were women who had been scrambling for food handed out by a rich man in the small coastal town of Sidi Boulaalam. A local journalist said the donor had organised similar handouts before, but this year some 1,000 people arrived, storming an iron barrier under which several women were crushed.  King Mohammed ordered that the victims  families be given any assistance they needed and the wounded treated at his cost, the ministry said in a statement, adding that a criminal investigation had been opened. Last month, the king dismissed the ministers of education, planning and housing and health after an economic agency found  imbalances  in implementing a development plan to fight poverty in the northern Rif region. The Rif saw numerous protests after a fishmonger was accidentally crushed to death in a garbage truck in October 2016 after a confrontation with police, and he became a symbol of the effects of corruption and official abuse. In July, the king pardoned dozens of people arrested in the protests and accused local officials of stoking public anger by being too slow to implement development projects. ',\n",

       " 'Every American should be demanding answers about why Barack Hussein Obama is in such a hurry to empty Gitmo before he leaves office. Illegal alien prisoners are being released at an unprecedented rate. Our borders are being left wide open by a President who s demanded our US Border Agents stand down. Visas are being given to people coming here with the sole intention of harming innocent Americans. Law enforcement has been ridiculed and weakened by a spiteful racist and his willing accomplices in the media. What do we need to do to alert the Kim Kardashian followers our United States of America  is intentionally being destroyed by a radical in the White House?National Security: The Pentagon has cleared the release of 17 more terrorist detainees from Guantanamo Bay prison. President Obama puts jihadist boots on the ground before mobilizing U.S. troops in the Middle East.A congressional aide told Fox News on Thursday that the White House s strategy in the decision this week to set free more terrorist prisoners from the Gitmo facility in U.S.-controlled territory in Cuba is to get the number of detainees there to  as low as they can get,  even if it means  a good deal of risk.  The underlying reason is that closing Gitmo was a major Obama campaign promise in 2008, and he doesn t want to leave office with it still open.But the promise was to close it in 2009. Upon taking office, however, Obama found himself faced with the fact that Gitmo was a rather brilliant idea that the Bush administration came up with to prevent captured terrorists from exploiting the U.S. legal system.The spectacle of U.S. courts setting terrorists free, after trials in which the jihadists  American legal teams might actually get access to and make public sensitive classified information, was not anything for which Obama wanted to be blamed. He seems amenable, however, to his successor having nowhere to hold captured terrorists.Release of the 17 supposedly  low-level  combatants, many of them from Yemen, where war rages, brings the number of Gitmo prisoners down to 90. We were told that  Osama bin Laden s cook,  Ibrahim al-Qosi, released by Obama from Gitmo in 2012, was low-level, but now he cooks up terrorist operations as a celebrity leader of al-Qaida in Yemen.The Pentagon is going along with this politicized emptying of the Guantanamo Bay holding facility. And the decision coming right after an Islamic State-inspired Christmas party attack within the homeland, which slaughtered 14 innocent Americans, suggests the U.S. military leadership has become a group of puppets.A major reason for former Republican Sen. Chuck Hagel s forced departure as Obama s defense secretary last year after a brief tenure, let s not forget, was his hesitation in approving Gitmo releases.In last week s GOP presidential debate, it was a woman who promised that she would  immediately  reverse Obama s emasculation of the Pentagon. Carly Fiorina pledged to  bring back the warrior class   Petraeus, McChrystal, Mattis, Keane, Flynn   every one was retired early because they told President Obama things that he didn t want to hear. Obama calls Gitmo  a sad chapter in American history,  but it was almost comic when the worst complaint Shaker Aamer, released from Gitmo in October after nearly 14 years, could tell of in a British TV interview was  they just suck all your feelings out of you,  adding that  torture is not about beating. Torture is not about hanging from the ceiling with handcuffs and all that     all that  presumably being three square halal meals a day, courtesy of the U.S. taxpayer.Curiously,  The Most Transparent Administration in History  is now imposing new, severe restrictions on journalist access to Guantanamo Bay, with no more visits to the two detention centers where most detainees are housed, and no more interviews of guards and staff. Outgoing U.S. Southern Command chief Marine Gen. John Kelly told AP that the reason was:  We really did have to get some organization to what was going on down there.  After all these years?Under Obama, information on the frequency of prisoners assaulting guards and conducting hunger strikes has stopped being made public.It isn t torture or mistreatment that the Obama administration is hiding from the world s eyes within the walls of Guantanamo Bay; it s that what we have down there is a luxury resort to house terrorists, and that the president is incrementally releasing those soldiers of jihad back onto the battlefield   after America has spent years fattening them up.

       " 'Did you know that people who support Donald Trump s unconstitutional Muslim ban are idiots? This isn t just a flippant remark about them; there s evidence   like the fact that most of them think the Bowling Green Massacre, which did not happen, completely justifies Trump s executive order.A new report from Public Policy Polling found that most Americans   48 to 43 percent   view the  travel ban  as targeting Muslims , and only 22 percent of Americans support that position. In fact, the phrase  one would have to be an idiot to support the Muslim ban  is now more true than ever. Do you agree or disagree with the following statement:  the Bowling Green massacre shows why we need Donald Trump s executive order on immigration?  respondents were asked, with 57 percent disagreeing and only 23 percent backing that position.The low number of Americans who still somehow think the Bowling Green Massacre is real is positive   but when PPP looked at numbers among Trump supporters, they found that more than half view the Massacre That Didn t Happen as justification for Trump s ban:66% of Americans consider the United States to be a safe country, to only 23% who consider it unsafe. Perhaps as an outgrowth of that sentiment only 45% of voters support Trump s Executive Order on immigration, to 49% who are opposed to it. Among those who do support it you have to wonder how well thought out their position is- by a 51/23 margin Trump voters say that the Bowling Green Massacre shows why Trump s immigration policy is needed. By a 48/43 spread, voters do think that the intent of the Executive Order is to be a Muslim ban. And just 22% support a Muslim ban, to 65% who are opposed.Trump is likely sweating bullets, as the poll also reveals that almost half   48 percent of Americans   want to see him impeached. His henchmen and women are growing steadily more unpopular too. 47 percent of Americans (compared to 34 percent who like her) find Kellyanne Conway to be detestable, 41 percent (32% like him) are dissatisfied with Sean Spicer s performance. A whopping 49 percent (compared to 27 percent) don t like Education Secretary Betsy DeVos, and 72 percent hate Trump s best friend Vladimir Putin. In fact   a sign of how desperate things have gotten   more Americans (38 percent to 30 percent) say they would rather see Mike Pence as President than Trump. Hillary Clinton still wins in that regard, 49 percent to 45 percent.Even worse for Trump is the demographics of those polled. Only 39 percent of respondents identify as Democrats while 60 percent say they are Republicans or Independents, the exact groups Trump courted when he was running for President. In other words, there s no claiming that this poll was loaded with Democrats for Trump fans.Donald Trump said during the election that he loves the  poorly educated,  but he might as well have said stupid. Though Kellyanne Conway has used the Bowling Green Massacre in her scaremongering numerous time and ultimately admitted she lied about its existence, The Donald s supporters still take it as gospel.

And yet now he thinks he deserves the power to run your life and your finances    We will raise taxes;  he confirmed Monday,  yes, we will. One of his first jobs was registering people for food stamps, and it was all downhill from there.Sanders took his first bride to live in a maple sugar shack with a dirt floor, and she soon left him. Penniless, he went on unemployment. Then he had a child out of wedlock. Desperate, he tried carpentry but could barely sink a nail.  He was a shi**y carpenter,  a friend told Politico Magazine.  His carpentry was not going to support him, and didn t. Then he tried his hand freelancing for leftist rags, writing about  masturbation and rape  and other crudities for $50 a story. He drove around in a rusted-out, Bondo-covered VW bug with no working windshield wipers. Friends said he was  always poor  and his  electricity was turned off a lot.

Save for a municipal pension, Sanders lists no assets in his name. All the assets provided in his financial disclosure form are his second wife s. He does, however, have as much as $65,000 in credit-card debt.Sure, Sanders may not be a hypocrite, but this is nothing to brag about. His worthless background contrasts sharply with the successful careers of other  outsiders  in the race for the White House, including a billionaire developer, a world-renowned neurosurgeon and a Fortune 500 CEO.The choice in this election is shaping up to be a very clear one. It will likely boil down to a battle between those who create and produce wealth, and those who take it and redistribute it.Via: IBD',\n",

The Senate Commerce Committee said on Tuesday it was moving Ross’s hearing to Jan. 18 from Jan. 12 because Ross has not completed all of the necessary government paperwork. Trump takes office on Jan. 20. “While Mr. Ross has submitted his responses to the committee’s questionnaire, we have not yet received the ethics agreement he is working on with the Office of Government Ethics and the Department of Commerce to finalize,” the panel’s Republican and Democratic leaders said in a joint statement. The Ross delay came shortly after postponements of hearings for Trump’s choices to head the Education and Labor departments.

The committee’s Republican majority said on Twitter on Monday that it had moved DeVos’s hearing at the request of Senate leadership to accommodate its schedule.

The United Nations  top human rights official on Monday slammed Myanmar for conducting a  cruel military operation  against the Rohingya, branding it  a textbook example of ethnic cleansing .  This is creating a huge challenge for Bangladesh in terms of providing shelter as well as other humanitarian assistance to them,  Bangladesh s foreign ministry said in a statement on Monday as Foreign Minister Abul Hassan Mahmood Ali held talks with diplomats. He urged the international community to push Myanmar to find a  permanent solution to this crisis  and  sought support for transportation of the Rohingya to Bhashan Char , also known as Thengar Char. Bangladesh, one of the world s poorest and most crowded nations, plans to develop Thengar Char, which only emerged from the silt off Bangladesh s delta coast 11 years ago and is two hours by boat from the nearest settlement.  It regularly floods during June-September monsoons and, when seas are calm, pirates roam the nearby waters to kidnap fishermen for ransom. The plan to develop the island and use it to house refugees was criticized by humanitarian workers when it was proposed in 2015 and revived last year. Bangladesh, though, insists it alone has the right to decide where to shelter the growing numbers of refugees. ',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - Republican presidential nominee Donald Trump’s provocative proposals on immigration, trade and other issues have drawn attention and verbal attacks - as well as some praise - well beyond the United States’ shores. Here is a sampling. Trump and Russian President Vladimir Putin have often praised each other. Last December, Putin described the New York businessman as “a very flamboyant man, very talented.” Trump, who lauded Putin in return, also spoke well of him in September, saying at a televised forum with Democratic presidential nominee Hillary Clinton that Putin had been a better leader than Democratic U.S. President Barack Obama. Some of the strongest criticism of Trump from abroad has come from Mexican officials because of his verbal attacks on illegal Mexican immigrants and his promise to build a wall on the southern border and make Mexico pay for it. Following talks in Mexico City between Trump and Enrique Pena Nieto, the Mexican president said the American’s policy stances “could represent a huge threat to Mexico, and I am not prepared to keep my arms crossed and do nothing.” Earlier this year, he likened Trump to dictators Adolf Hitler and Benito Mussolini. In April, Chinese Finance Minister Lou Jiwei called Trump “an irrational type” because of the candidate’s proposal that tariffs on imported Chinese goods be increased to up to 45 percent. “If he were to do this, that would be in violation of the rules set by the World Trade Organization,” Lou said in an interview with the Wall Street Journal. Then-British Prime Minister David Cameron in May called Trump’s initial proposal for a temporary ban on Muslim’s entering the United States “very dangerous.” In December, Cameron had called Trump, potentially the leader of Britain’s closest ally, “divisive, stupid and wrong” for calling for the ban.  Nigel Farage, a politician who played a key role in the successful campaign to get Britain out of the European Union, lent his support to Trump in August, appearing with the candidate at a rally in Jackson, Mississippi. Farage said Trump represented the same type of anti-establishment movement that he had masterminded in his own country. London’s first Muslim mayor, Sadiq Khan, said in May that Trump had an “ignorant view of Islam,” referring to Trump’s initial proposed ban on Muslims. {nL2N18709R] In September, during his first U.S. visit, Khan expressed support for Clinton. French President Francois Hollande said in August that a Trump victory could make politics more conservative around the world and that the New York businessman made people “feel nauseous.” A Trump win could also affect France’s spring 2017 presidential election, said Hollande. Germany’s European affairs minister, Michael Roth, said in August that Trump’s assertion that Chancellor Angela Merkel’s open-door refugee policy had resulted in a huge increase in crime was incorrect. Roth said it was important to correct campaign statements in other countries that were based on “fears, lies and half-truths,” given the importance of the U.S. election for the world. In April, the German foreign minister, Frank-Walter Steinmeier, criticized Trump’s “America First” policy, which the candidate had unveiled in a speech that week. Steinmeier said world security could no longer be ensured unilaterally and that international conflicts could only be solved nowadays if heavyweights like the United States and Russia and others joined forces. The “America First” stance - which included a portrayal by Trump of longtime ally Japan as a free rider on security - also came in for a veiled swipe from Japan’s ambassador to the United States, Kenichiro Sasae, in May. Without mentioning Trump by name, Sasae said he did not want to see an isolationist United States. “I want to see the United States to be strong and come with a strong robust position, not really thinking of the United States only,” he said. U.N. High Commissioner for Human Rights Zeid Ra’ad al Hussein said on Wednesday that the world would be in danger if Trump became president. He cited Trump’s views on vulnerable communities, including minorities, and his talk of authorizing torture in interrogations, banned under international law, as “deeply unsettling and disturbing.” ',\n",

He likes me anyway,  according to a transcription from the Washington Examiner.The comment came the day after Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi had dinner with Trump at the White House. The topic of conversation was centered on the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals (DACA) immigration amnesty program, according to the Democratic lawmakers. After the dinner, Schumer and Pelosi released a statement claiming Trump agreed to support DACA legislation in exchange for the Democrats  support in passing a border security package, one without border wall funding. The White House came out afterwards, denying any such agreement was made. Look, what we said was exactly accurate,  Schumer said to staffers in reference to his statement.The Democratic senator then recounted to aides what advice he gave the president. Here s what I told him:  Mr. President, you are much better off sometimes stepping right and sometimes step left. [If] you have to step just in one direction, you re boxed,  he said. He gets that.

       " 'What would a speech from a modern Democrat be if they didn t include the LGBT crowd and embrace illegal aliens? It s almost as if they were trying to divide our nation in order to gain votes.??The mayor of Kansas City, Kansas, in an address to the radical socialist organization National Council of La Raza, bragged that his city is no longer majority white and the city s schools now have students who speak 62 different languages.According to the 2010 U.S. Census, Kansas City, Kansas, was 52 percent white.But in a speech before the La Raza National Affiliates Luncheon earlier this week in Kansas City, Mayor Mark Holland boasted that only five years later his city s white population has been reduced to 40 percent.He seemed to suggest that La Raza was at least partly responsible for the progress. But he also cited the refugee resettlement work of the United Nations and U.S. State Department for the city s transformation into a gleaming example of multicultural diversity.Kansas City, he said,  is very proud of the work of National Council of La Raza. Kansas City, Kansas, is a city with no ethnic majority. Kansas City, Kansas, is 40 percent white, 28 percent Latino, and 26 percent African-American,  Holland said.  Our school district speaks 62 different languages by the children every single day. And Kansas City, Kansas, has a proud heritage of welcoming all people into the community, people who are not welcome in other places. Latinos started coming with the Santa Fe railroad more than 100 years ago, to build the railroad, he said. Another railroad, the Underground Railroad, brought African-Americans to Kansas.  If they could get across the river they were free and settled in a township of Quindero. We continue to have a number of groups of refugees from around the world,  he added, mentioning the large Hmong community that came in the 1970s and 80s following the Vietnam War.In recent years, the city has welcomed more refugees from other parts of the world, including Muslim Somalia, Afghanistan and Iraq, Hindus from Bhutan and Buddhists and Muslims from Burma.LGBTs welcome in KCKansas City has also thrown open its arms to the LGBT community, Holland said, even though most of the state of Kansas leans Republican.He said the city is the home of another  persecuted group   the Democrats. The Democrats still have a foothold in Kansas City and we re very proud of that,  said the Democrat mayor.  And because Democrats are in Wyandotte County, we welcome our gay and lesbian brothers and sisters and celebrate their life and their love, and always will. Holland, an ordained Methodist minister, then went on the attack against any Christians who don t share his liberal theological views on same-sex marriage.He applauded the recent 5-4 Supreme Court decision that redefined marriage for all 50 states. But we cannot let our guard down. This religious freedom component, I believe is the Confederate Flag of religious bigotry, being flown long after the fact,  Holland said.  As an ordained United Methodist pastor myself, I m offended to note, when they say Christians are offended by the ruling. In fact, many of us Christians celebrate the ruling and the continued welcome and recognition of all people. But I want to close by saying we just couldn t be more proud that La Raza is here in Kansas City and it s an honor to be able to greet you. The U.S. State Department, working with the United Nations, has sent 2,371 international refugees to Kansas City, Kansas, since 2002. The State Department s database does not include U.N. refugees dispersed throughout the U.S. before 2002 but the program has been ongoing in its current form since 1980. The U.N. picks about 95 percent of the refugees sent to the U.S. The State Department, working with nine major contractors such as the U.S. Conference of Catholic Bishops, Hebrew Immigrant Aid Society and Lutheran Immigration and Refugee Service, distributes about 70,000 refugees annually from mostly Third World nations into 190 U.S. cities and towns.U.N. sends KC 2,371 refugees since 2002The refugees, unlike most other classifications of immigrants, immediately qualify for a smorgasbord of state and federal welfare benefits and are placed on a fast-track toward full citizenship, which is obtainable within five years.Since 2002 Kansas City has received 1,090 refugees from Burma, 577 from Bhutan, 190 from Somalia, 126 from Iraq, 47 from Liberia, 37 from Eritrea, 36 from Russia, 34 from Burundi, 33 from Afghanistan, 26 from Vietnam, 24 from Sudan, 18 from Uzbekistan, and 11 from Iran, according to State Department data.Via: WND',\n",
       " 'Detroit s own Kid Rock will open the all-new Little Caesars Arena on Tuesday, Sept. 12, but a group is planning a rally outside of the arena ahead of his concert.The rally will take place from 6:30 p.m. to 8:30 p.m. outside of the arena. The concert is scheduled to start at 7:30 p.m.According to the Facebook event, the group plans to  rally against symbols of white supremacy and hate in our amazing city of Detroit. Kid Rock has previously used the Confederate Flag at his concerts, and in 2015, the National Action Network asked General Motors to stop sponsoring his tour over the use of the flag.At the time, General Motors found Kid Rock has not flown the Confederate Flag since around 2011.  WXYZStephen Henderson, the race-obsessed Editorial Page Editor of the Detroit Free Press had this to say about Kid Rock and the Illitches, who never gave up on the city of Detroit, and continued to throw tens of millions of dollars at new ventures, even when many of us in the suburbs believed they were wasting their money on a city that could never be resecutated:This is a musician who got rich off crass cultural appropriation of black music, who used to wrap his brand in the Confederate flag   a symbol inextricably linked to racism, no matter what its defenders say   and who has repeatedly issued profane denouncements of the very idea of African Americans pushing back against American inequality. Just last week, he trashed Colin Kaepernick, the former San Francisco 49ers quarterback who s jobless right now because he dared challenge the nation s racism with a silent, kneeling protest during the pre-football game singing of the national anthem.Having Kid Rock open this arena is erecting a sturdy middle finger to Detroiters   nothing less. And the Ilitches, who ve done so much for this city and also taken so much from it, should be the last to embrace that kind of signaling.Sadly, it s people like Stephen Henderson who are so steeped in hate for anyone who doesn t buy into his embarrassing attempts to shame the white man, that will help to keep the hateful and divisive course Barack Obama set for our nation alive and well ',\n",
       " 'Following all the idiotic drama of Donald Trump s choosing Mike Pence of Indiana for his running mate, Hillary Clinton s choice of Senator Tim Kaine may have seemed a little lackluster to some. However, Kaine compliments Hillary in a way that many people probably haven t thought of, and their pairing makes Trump and Pence look far worse now than before.Politifact, which Republicans revile because they think facts are pesky, annoying things to be ignored, put out a scorecard with the ratings of 27 statements Tim Kaine has made. It turns out that he has more statements rated True and Mostly True than he does Half True, Mostly False, and False put together. He has no Pants On Fire ratings at all.Compare that to Mike Pence. Politifact has rated 20 statements Pence has made, and of those 20, only four are True or Mostly True. Four! He has six Half True statements and six False statements. His only saving grace here is that he also doesn t have any Pants On Fire ratings.A look at Hillary Clinton s and Donald Trump s Politifact scorecards just drives home the point that the GOP is riddled with people who lie and spread misinformation. Trump, being the master liar he is, has more False and Pants On Fire statements than he does Mostly False, Half True, Mostly True and True statements combined.Hillary, on the other hand, has more True and Mostly True statements than she does Half True, Mostly False, False and Pants On Fire all together, just like her chosen running mate. These two are a good team just on that basis.So is it really any wonder that Hillary introduced her running mate as  everything Donald Trump and Mike Pence are not?  Of course, she was talking about the policies that Trump and Pence are putting together, but the ability to acknowledge facts and tell the truth is another major way in which Hillary Clinton and Tim Kaine are not, well, anything like any Republican we ve got.In other words, we have two presidential tickets that illustrate Republican honesty versus Democratic honesty, and Democratic honesty wins hands down. Facts don t lie, and unfortunately for the GOP, facts have a liberal bias.Photo of Clinton/Kaine by Justin Sullivan/Getty Images. Photo of Trump/Pence by Alex Wong/Getty Images.

       " 'SYDNEY (Reuters) - Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull on Tuesday named a new attorney general and promoted two junior lawmakers from rural Queensland state to his cabinet in a reshuffle he hopes will bolster his flagging popularity. Australian leaders often revamp cabinets before the start of a new year but for center-right Turnbull the move is an attempt to salvage his leadership, ravaged by dismal opinion polls. Last month, Turnbull s ruling Liberal-National coalition made its worst showing in a Queensland election in more than a decade, when it won 34 percent of the vote as Pauline Hanson s populist One Nation clawed into its conservative base.  A large number of marginal seats in the country s third most populous state of Queensland often give its voters a crucial say in deciding federal elections. The reshuffle was sparked by the resignation of Attorney General George Brandis from the Senate. Turnbull said he would ask Brandis to be the country s next High Commissioner, or ambassador, to the United Kingdom. Turnbull gave cabinet positions to Queenslanders John McVeigh and David Littleproud, who both took office 18 months ago. He dropped infrastructure minister Darren Chester, from the urban state of Victoria, giving the portfolio to deputy prime minister Barnaby Joyce, the leader of the Nationals, which features prominently in Queensland.  It s a ministry that showcases the depth of the Liberal and National team, with well-earned promotions for talented individuals, a number of young and upcoming MPs bringing new skills and energy to the frontbench,  Turnbull told reporters in Sydney. Asked why he removed Chester, whose duties included running the Australian part of the fruitless search for missing Malaysia Airlines flight MH370, Turnbull said his cabinet had  to take into account matters of geography , but did not elaborate. The pitch to voters in the northeastern state of Queensland was obvious, said Stewart Jackson, a specialist in Australian politics at the University of Sydney.      Everybody s been spooked by One Nation,  Jackson said.  The emphasis will shift back towards Queensland where the National Party was traditionally strong.  The overhaul also brings youth into a government that has narrowly retained its razor-thin majority in parliament after a constitutional crisis triggered a series of by-elections. The two promoted Queenslanders, Littleproud and McVeigh, are 41 and 52 respectively. The new attorney general, social services minister Christian Porter, from the iron ore-rich state of Western Australia, is 47. Employment minister Michaelia Cash, who takes the expanded title of minister for jobs and innovation, and Nationals member Bridget McKenzie, who joins cabinet as minister for sport, rural health and regional communications, are also 47. Turnbull gave no reason for the departure of Brandis after 17 years, but called him a  stalwart  who had backed tougher national security laws and the legalization of same-sex marriage, a measure parliament passed this month. In 2015, when Turnbull unseated then prime minister Tony Abbott, he said the move was necessary because Abbott s government had lost 30 opinion polls in a row. Under Turnbull, the government has lost 25 opinion polls in a row. Many commentators say that if the figure reaches 30, which could happen as soon as March, Turnbull s party may consider removing him. ',\n",
       " 'PARIS (Reuters) - France said on Wednesday it was imperative the United Nations Security Council apply more pressure on North Korea to prevent it jumping another hurdle toward an effective nuclear weapons capacity that could lead to a dangerous military escalation. Amid heightened tension on the Korean peninsula, North Korea has escalated a war of words with the United States, warning of full-out nuclear war if Washington takes military action against it over its nuclear and missile ambitions. “We have to avoid all military escalation,” Foreign Minister Jean-Marc Ayrault told LCP television. “This threatens nuclear proliferation in the region, but also directly threatens North America. It’s a major danger.” Ayrault, who was in China last week and whose country has no diplomatic representation in North Korea, said it appeared that Beijing was increasingly worried by the behavior of its neighbor. “China is scared of chaos and destabilization of the regime that would result in millions of refugees in the region so we can make progress through international pressure ... sanctions and discussions between the Security Council members to take measures,” he said.  U.S. Vice President Mike Pence said on Wednesday that Washington would work with its allies and China to put economic and diplomatic pressure on North Korea but added that America would defeat any attack with an “overwhelming response”. “There is no time to lose because all of the money North Korea has is being used for nuclear investment and research which would enable the country to jump another hurdle,” he said.

       " 'Why would any sane person choose to enlist in our military when we don t even have a Commander In Chief who is fighting this war to win?  Last week, in the wake of Russian and US airstrikes on ISIS oil convoys, we asked three important questions:Who are the commodity trading firms that have been so generously buying millions of smuggled oil barrels procured by the Islamic State at massive discounts to market, and then reselling them to other interested parties? In other words, who are the middlemen?Can it possibly be true, as officials now claim, that the Obama administration refrained from bombing Islamic State oil trucks because Washington thought the group was  only  making $100 million per year instead of $400 million?Is it likely, considering how cavalier the US is about collateral damage from drone strikes, that The Pentagon refused to take out Islamic State s revenue stream because the military was afraid of killing a few  innocent  truck drivers who by definition knew they were transporting illegal crude for a terrorist organization?The first question is, for now anyway, unanswerable. As to the second and third, here s what we said:Perhaps the US overestimated the effect its airstrikes were having on Islamic State s oil production capabilities and perhaps The Pentagon was concerned with killing innocent truck drivers, but it could also be that, as Sergei Lavrov suggested earlier this month, the US has until now intentionally avoided hitting ISIS where it hurts in order to keep them in the game and ensure they can still be effective at destabilizing Assad. If you cut off the oil trade, they lose the ability to battle the regime.Whatever the case, it s too late now, because just as Russian airstrikes and the Iranian ground presence forced the US to do something   anything   to prove to the world that America is serious about fighting terrorism, Moscow s targeting of ISIS oil convoys has forced the US to get on board (the Russians are going to hit them anyway, so there s no point in vacillating).American airstrikes reportedly destroyed 116 oil tanker trucks earlier this month and another 280 today in Paris mastermind Abdelhamid Abaaoud s former fiefdom of Deir ez-Zor.Of course the US would hate to catch ISIS off guard risk killing innocent truck drivers, so prior to the November 16 strike, US planes dropped leaflets warning the drivers to  get out of your trucks now, and run away from them.  Here s the leaflet (note the stick figures running for their lives):Here s some commentary from Colonel Steve Warren from Operation Inherent Resolve (delivered at a press conference earlier this month):Early Sunday morning in Al-Bukamal, which is the southern blue circle number two, you see two blue circles there. They both represent Tidal Wave II operations, but we re in the southern one   the one further towards the bottom of your screen, there.In Al-Bukamal, we destroyed 116 tanker trucks, which we believe will reduce ISIL s ability to transport its stolen oil products.This is our first strike against tanker trucks, and to minimize risks to civilians, we conducted a leaflet drop prior to the strike. We did a show of force, by   we had aircraft essentially buzz the trucks at low altitude.So, I do have copy of the leaflet, and I have got some videos, so why don t you pull the leaflet up. Let me take a look at it so I can talk about it.As you can see, it s a fairly simple leaflet, it says,  Get out of your trucks now, and run away from them.  A very simple message.And then, also,  Warning: airstrikes are coming. Oil trucks will be destroyed. Get away from your oil trucks immediately. Do not risk your life. And so, these are the leaflets that we dropped   about 45 minutes before the airstrikes actually began.And here s an amusing bit from the post-presser Q&A:Q: On Bob s question, too, if   if it s so important to cut off the oil shipments, the critical revenue source for ISIS, why did it take so long to take out 116 oil tanker trucks?COL. WARREN: No, that s a great question, Jim. Thanks for asking it.So, a little history on Operation Tidal Wave II. Initially, we, you know, we have been striking oil infrastructure targets since the very beginning of this operation.What we found out was that many of our strikes were only minimally effective. We would strike pieces of the oil infrastructure that were easily repaired.When we came to that realization, we conducted some more study   I think I talked about this last week, a little bit   we conducted some more study, and determined how to better strike the oil infrastructure itself, different pieces of the system.During the course of that study, we also determined that part of the illicit oil system, from the oil coming out of the ground at a   at a pump head, to the end of that chain, which is the distribution network.So, this is a decision that we had to make. We have not struck these trucks before. We assessed that these trucks, while although they are being used for operations that support ISIL, the truck drivers, themselves, probably not members of ISIL; they re probably just civilians. So we had to figure out a way around that. We re not in this business to kill civilians, we re in this business to stop ISIL   to defeat ISIL.So basically, it took the US 13 months to figure out that the best way to cripple Islamic State s oil trade was to bomb   the oil.To the extent that occurred to anyone previously, the idea was dismissed because the truck drivers are  probably not members of ISIL.  Well then who are they? Sure, they may not be suiting up in all black and firing RPGs at Toyota Corollas packed with  spies  for a propaganda video, but it s not like they don t know who they re working for.Also, as mentioned above, the US hasn t exactly been shy about engaging targets even when there are women, children, and bedridden hospital patients in the vicinity so it s hard to imagine that anyone at the Pentagon was worried about Islamic State s truck drivers.Whatever the case, the US is apprently set to give ISIS a 45 minute heads up when The Pentagon plans to bomb an oil convoy which we suppose makes sense.It s the least the CIA can do for an old friend.

This  fire sale  of private Greek islands to  bargain hunters  is expected to take place over the next few years, according to property agent Knight Frank.Greece imposed the first-ever real estate tax last year to raise cash for creditors, making property ownership prohibitively expensive, according to Knight Frank s Island Report.Foreign investors are taking advantage of the falling property prices, which have plunged by 30 percent over the last five years thanks to Greece s debt crisis. Here are some island hunters who hoped to profit from Greece s woes:Russian billionaire s daughter buys Skorpios for ~$150 million Ekaterina Rybolovleva, the daughter of Russian billionaire and former owner of Russia s largest potassium fertilizer producer Dmitry Rybolovlev, reportedly bought the island for $150 million in 2013. Skorpios was owned since 1962 by shipping tycoon Aristotle Onassis and served as the location of his wedding to Jackie Kennedy.

       " 'SURENDRANAGAR, India (Reuters) - Tens of thousands of Indians voted in the first stage of assembly elections in the western state of Gujarat on Saturday, where Prime Minister Narendra Modi faces his toughest electoral test since coming to power with a landslide victory in 2014. Modi has himself led the campaign to ensure that his Bharatiya Janata Party (BJP) retains power in his home state, as a combined opposition mounted the biggest challenge ahead of the general election in 2019.   Three big polls carried out in the run-up to the vote on Saturday and next week have predicted a victory for BJP but with a greatly reduced majority. Voters started turning up early in the morning and some had to wait for about 15 minutes due to a malfunction in the electronic voting machine. In the first few hours, more than 15 percent of voters in Surendranagar district cast their ballot, according to state government officials. An ABP-CDS poll this week gave the BJP 91-99 seats in the 182-member state house and the main opposition Congress 78-86, suggesting a close fight. To win, a party needs 92 seats.   The surveys have often gone wrong, though, and Modi himself remains far more popular across the country than his rivals, including Rahul Gandhi who is leading the Congress charge to weaken Modi in his home base.   Votes from the election will be counted on Dec. 18 and the results announced the same day.   In the first stage of state assembly elections on Saturday, 977 candidates are trying their luck in 89 constituencies spread across 19 districts of Gujarat, according to the Election Commission. More than 21 million people will vote during the first stage of the election on Saturday. Modi has thrown himself into the campaign, addressing dozens of rallies over the past month, saying he alone could deliver on development. Gujarati businesses, which form the core of Modi s support base, have complained that the Goods and Services Tax introduced this year and late last year s shock move to abolish 500 and 1,000 rupee bank notes, accounting for 86 percent of cash in circulation, aggravated already tough economic conditions. Hindu-majority Gujarat is one of India s richest and fastest growing states but also one of its most communally divided. About 1,000 people, mostly Muslims, were killed after a wave of riots rocked Gujarat in 2002, when Modi was chief minister. A Supreme Court investigation found no case against Modi, who denied any wrongdoing. ',\n",

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A White House official on Sunday attacked a U.S. court ruling that blocked President Donald Trump’s executive order on immigration as a “judicial usurpation of power” and said the administration was considering a range of options, including a new order. Sustained criticism of the judiciary from the White House comes amid concern among Democrats and legal scholars over Trump’s view of the constitutional principle of judicial independence as the administration seeks to overcome legal setbacks to its travel ban issued on Jan. 27. It has also become the backdrop against which U.S. senators consider Trump’s Supreme Court nominee, Judge Neil Gorsuch, for a lifetime appointment to the nation’s highest court.  The Republican president said on Friday that he may issue a new executive order rather than go through lengthy court challenges to the original one, which temporarily barred entry to the United States of people from seven Muslim-majority countries. “We have multiple options and we are considering all of them,” White House senior policy adviser Stephen Miller said on ABC’s “This Week.”  Miller sharply criticized the 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals ruling on Thursday that upheld a Seattle federal judge’s suspension of Trump’s executive order. He accused the San Francisco-based court of having a history of overreaching and of being overturned. “This is a judicial usurpation of power,” he said on “Fox News Sunday.” “The president’s powers here are beyond question.” The Trump administration has defended the travel ban on grounds it will prevent potential terrorists from entering the country, although no acts of terrorism have been perpetrated on U.S. soil by citizens of the targeted countries. The ban’s announcement, late on a Friday, sparked a weekend of confusion at airports around the globe and within the federal agencies charged with enforcing it. It also triggered widespread protests and legal challenges. Aware that a new executive order would allow critics to declare victory against the travel ban, the White House has deflected blame and intensified its criticism of the judiciary. “I think it’s been an important reminder to all Americans that we have a judiciary that has taken far too much power and become in many cases a supreme branch of government,” Miller said on CBS’ “Face the Nation.” “One unelected judge in Seattle cannot make laws for the entire country. I mean this is just crazy,” he said. Miller’s performance on several Sunday news shows won a plaudit on Twitter from Trump, who has himself attacked individual judges and called the courts “so political.” “Great job!” Trump tweeted. Gorsuch condemned the attacks on the judiciary as “disheartening” in private meetings last week with a number of U.S. senators, who pressed the judge to go public. Ron Bonjean, a Republican strategist, confirmed the conversations. Legal experts said the Trump administration statements could undermine respect for the constitutional division of powers. Cornell University law professor Jens David Ohlin said that accusing the judiciary of usurping the president’s powers demonstrated “an absurd lack of appreciation for the separation of powers.” “Miller is coming dangerously close to reviving a discredited and dangerous theory that each branch of government, including the president, has independent authority to decide what the law and Constitution mean,” Ohlin said in an interview on Sunday.  “In our system of government, the commander in chief executes the laws, but it is the judiciary which interprets both the laws and statutes passed by Congress and the Constitution. That’s their solemn duty,” he added. Ilya Shapiro, a senior fellow in constitutional studies at the libertarian Cato Institute, said Trump’s remarks could diminish popular respect for institutions of law and order by making Americans think “the government’s a joke, that you don’t have to follow what judges say.” Immigration laws give the U.S. president broad powers to restrict who enters the country on national security grounds. But the same laws forbid discrimination based on race, sex, nationality or place of birth or residence. The case also could involve First Amendment protections involving religion. Trump’s executive order banned entry into the United States to refugees and citizens of Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for 90 days and all refugees for 120 days, except refugees from Syria, who were banned indefinitely. Options for the administration include formulating a new executive action, appealing the 9th Circuit panel’s decision to the full appeals court and appealing the emergency stay to the U.S. Supreme Court, Miller said.

       " 'PHOENIX (Reuters) - Embattled Arizona lawman Joe Arpaio, whose get-tough policies to fight illegal immigration and praise of Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump brought him nationwide attention, trails his opponent in this year’s election by nearly 15 percentage points, according to a Thursday poll. The poll, conducted by The Arizona Republic/Morrison/Cronkite News, shows Democratic challenger Paul Penzone has the support of nearly 45.9 percent of those surveyed as he attempts to unseat the six-term Maricopa County sheriff. Arpaio garnered 31.1 percent. Roughly one-fifth of those surveyed said they were still undecided on the Nov. 8 race for the top law enforcement job in the state’s most populous county. The poll’s margin of error was plus or minus 5.6 percent. The poll was taken as federal prosecutors announced that the U.S. Justice Department would seek a criminal contempt charge against Arpaio for violating a court order in a 2007 racial profiling case. The charges center on unlawful traffic stops and detentions by deputies of Latino drivers for 18 months after the judge ordered them to cease. Arpaio, who has denied any intentional wrongdoing, has already been cited for civil contempt stemming from his actions in the case. Political observers have said prospects of a criminal prosecution for the 84-year-old hardline sheriff seem to have raised the ante in recent days in what already promised to be Arpaio’s sternest election test. Arpaio campaign manager Chad Willems disputed the poll results, saying that the campaign’s own survey has the sheriff leading Penzone by 7.5 points. “The recent ‘poll’ by the Arizona Republic is a complete joke,” said Willems in a statement to Reuters, adding that Democrats were disproportionately included in the survey’s sample size. “The numbers in NO way accurately depict the electorate of Maricopa County, Arizona,” he said. “Why they chose to conduct their survey this way is beyond any comprehension.” A Penzone campaign official could not immediately be reached for comment. Arpaio has continued to play on a national stage during his tenure as sheriff despite his legal battles. His calls for a crackdown on undocumented immigrants, opening a tent city to house inmates and making them wear pink underwear all have proved popular. He also has appeared for Trump, praising the Republican nominee’s border policies, including building a wall along the U.S.-Mexican border. ',\n",

In response to Rove s suggestion that it would be acceptable for the Republicans to take the nomination away from Trump, even if he goes into the convention with the most delegates but not enough to secure the nomination, unhinged the Fox contributor. She said: The Republican establishment, desperate to stop Donald Trump and Ted Cruz, is still working to nullify our vote. If ever there were a time to not take away our vote, it s now   at a time when more people than ever are invested and voting. You want to keep your status quo   the one where one hand washes the other, and we pay for the soap. Pirro also reacted to Rove s remarks where he said a  fresh face  may be needed to beat Clinton in November. Pirro said: You want a fresh face? Aren t you the guy who kept bringing us one Bush after another? Continuing on her tangent, Pirro also attacked RNC Chairman Reince Priebus, calling him out for refusing to tell Sean Hannity  whether the presidential nominee for Republicans will be one of the top vote-getters   Trump or Cruz. Pirro said: Whatever happened to  your vote matters?  Not only is that infuriating, it is un-American.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A federal grand jury on Friday approved the first charges in the investigation into alleged Russian meddling in the 2016 U.S. presidential election, a source briefed on the matter told Reuters. The indictment was sealed under orders from a federal judge so it was not clear what the charges were or who the target was,  the source said, adding that it could be unsealed as early as Monday. The filing of charges by the grand jury in Washington was first reported on Friday by CNN, which said the target could be taken into custody as soon as Monday. U.S. intelligence agencies concluded in January that Russia interfered in the election to try to help President Donald Trump defeat Democratic candidate Hillary Clinton through a campaign of hacking and releasing embarrassing emails, and disseminating propaganda via social media to discredit her campaign. Special counsel Robert Mueller, a former director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, is investigating whether Trump campaign officials colluded with those Russian efforts. “If the Special Counsel finds it necessary and appropriate, the Special Counsel is authorized to prosecute federal crimes arising from the investigation of these matters,” Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein said in a May 17 letter appointing Mueller. Sources familiar with Mueller’s investigation said he has used that broad authority to investigate links between Trump aides and foreign governments as well as possible money laundering, tax evasion and other financial crimes. Peter Carr, a spokesman for Mueller, declined to comment on Friday. Trump, a Republican who was elected president last November, has denied allegations that his campaign colluded with Russians and condemned investigations into the matter as “a witch hunt”. The Kremlin has denied the allegations. Mueller’s investigation also includes an effort to determine whether Trump or any of his aides tried to obstruct justice.  The special counsel’s team has conducted interviews with former White House chief of staff Reince Priebus, former spokesman Sean Spicer and other current and former White House officials. In July, FBI agents raided the home in Virginia of Trump’s former campaign manager, Paul Manafort, whose financial and real estate dealings and prior work for a pro-Russian political party in Ukraine are being investigated by Mueller’s team. Mueller was appointed to lead the investigation a week after Trump fired FBI Director James Comey, who was heading a federal probe into possible collusion with Russia. Trump initially said he fired Comey because his leadership of the FBI was inadequate and hurt morale, but in a later interview with NBC he cited “this Russia thing” as his reason.  The Russia investigation has cast a shadow over Trump’s nine-month-old presidency and widened the partisan rift between Republicans and Democrats. Republican lawmakers earlier this week launched investigations to examine several of Trump’s longstanding political grievances, including the FBI probe of Hillary Clinton’s emails and her alleged role in a sale of U.S. uranium to a Russian firm. Mueller’s team has also investigated Michael Flynn, who was an adviser to Trump’s campaign and later briefly served as his national security adviser. Flynn was fired from that post in February after misleading Vice President Mike Pence about the extent of his conversations with Russian ambassador Sergei Kislyak last year. While he was on Trump’s campaign team, Flynn also had a $600,000 contract from a Turkish businessman to help discredit  U.S.-based Turkish cleric Fethullah Gulen, accused by Turkey’s government of instigating a failed coup in July 2016. Former CIA director James Woolsey, who was also an adviser to the Trump campaign, has alleged that Flynn discussed with the businessman and two Turkish government ministers the idea of covertly spiriting Gulen out of the United States to face charges in Turkey. Jonathan Franks, a spokesman for Woolsey, said on Friday that Woolsey and his wife have been in communication with the FBI and Mueller’s team about the claim. Woolsey and his wife, Nancye Miller, “have responded to every request, whether from the FBI, or, more recently, the Office of the Special Counsel,” Franks said in a statement.  Flynn has previously denied through a spokesperson that such a plan was ever discussed.  Reuters reported on Thursday that Woolsey and his wife last year pitched a $10 million project to the same Turkish businessman who had agreed a smaller contract with Flynn. They did not win a contract. Bidding for a lobbying or consulting contract with a foreign company or government is not illegal but Flynn came under scrutiny because he waited until March to retroactively register with the Justice Department as a foreign agent for the work he did on the Gulen project.

       " 'BARCELONA (Reuters) - Brazilian Felipe Massa completed two and a half race distances and put his Williams team on top of the timesheets as Formula One’s final pre-season test got underway in Barcelona on Tuesday. Massa, brought back in January after his former team mate Valtteri Bottas moved to Mercedes as replacement for retired world champion Nico Rosberg, completed 168 laps of the Circuit de Catalunya. His eye-catching tally was matched only by Ferrari’s Sebastian Vettel, who ended up third fastest (1:19.906) behind Red Bull’s Daniel Ricciardo (1:19.900). “I don’t remember before doing a day with 168 laps in my career,” said the 35-year-old Massa, whose fastest was one minute 19.726 seconds. “It was a lot of laps and I can feel it a bit on my body, but I am good. I feel in good shape for the new season,” he added. Triple world champion Lewis Hamilton, the bookmakers’ favorite for a fourth title this year, was fourth fastest with a total of 49 laps. Bottas, who took over the car in the afternoon, did 86 and was fifth. “I think Ferrari are possibly the favorites,” said Hamilton, whose running was cut short after the champions discovered damage to the floor of the car. “We can’t take our eyes off them because they have been doing such a great job at the moment. “Red Bull look like they have gone quite quick today as well. We’ll see over the next days and, most importantly, over the next weeks, but it’s going to be close in the first race, that’s for sure.” The season starts in Australia on March 26. Ferrari failed to win a race last season, when they finished third overall, and have not been constructors’ champions since 2008.  McLaren’s woes continued, with an electrical issue on the power unit of Belgian rookie Stoffel Vandoorne’s car forcing Honda to replace it, costing the team more track time after a difficult first week. “Based on this testing we can expect to have a few engine changes, but they (Honda) will have addressed this before the start of the season or at least quickly into the season,” said McLaren Racing Director Eric Boullier. Vandoorne completed 80 laps but was more than two seconds off the pace. Renault’s Jolyon Palmer managed only 15 laps due to a power unit problem but he handed over to team mate Nico Hulkenberg who completed 58 in the afternoon.  ',\n",
       " 'This week marked a particularly shameful level of the kind of Republican obstruction that has now become the norm. As reports came in that Zika had hit the United States with a vengeance, a crucial spending bill that would have allocated funds to fight the devastating illness was derailed. Having ignored the request by President Obama at the advice of disease scientists for $1.9 billion for research and prevention, Republicans offered first just half of that  then just a third.The sheer heartlessness astounded even some among the Republican Party. Senator Marco Rubio, whose state of Florida is ground zero for the Zika virus, gave a strongly worded condemnation of his colleagues  actions on Capitol Hill. The rest of the country merely braced for what is going to be a very scary summer.But while Republicans once again proved they have absolutely no interest in fulfilling even basic levels of governance, they were busy wasting everyone s time on something else. Given the stakes of the spending bill they didn t pass, what they did do is especially offensive.Just as the House was derailing the Zika funding (and an energy and water bill for that matter), they were drafting up a petition to demand the Library of Congress go back to using the degrading term  Illegal Alien  to refer to undocumented immigrants. That s how they spent their work week.Republicans on a powerful House panel Tuesday narrowly defended a tea party-fueled move to tell the Library of Congress how to label immigrants living in the country illegally.The GOP move is designed to force the Library of Congress to retain the term  illegal alien  for cataloging and search purposes, reversing the library s plan to replace  illegal alien  with less prejudicial terms like  noncitizens  or  unauthorized immigration. The Library of Congress has previously explained to Republicans that using the term  illegal alien  in its records is both offensive and confusing. For one thing, Library employees pointed out, the term  alien  could mean a space alien. Nobody is going to confuse an  unauthorized immigrant  with ET.This year, Congress scheduled itself for the least amount of workdays of any congressional term in modern history. Just 111 days will be spent  legislating  (and let s use that term loosely here). This is partly because Republicans have come to the conclusion that the best way to reduce government is to make it dysfunctional, but the other reason is that Republican leaders have realized that with an election coming up, their fanatical anti-government base will abandon them if they even so much as think about reaching across the aisle. Even for something as important as funding the fight against a virus that causes severe birth defects. So instead they ve taken to sitting on their hands. Cowardly? Craven? Cynical? All of the above?It s comforting to know that in the short time that they do spend on lawmaking, Republicans have their priorities in order. Zika funding? No. Supreme Court confirmation hearings? Nah. Changing the semantics of the cataloging and search functions in the Library of Congress so as to be intentionally derogatory? You better believe it.Featured image via Win McNamee/Getty Images',\n",

Bernie Sanders can without consequence apply his own religious rubric in opposing a presidential nominee who believes non-Christians risk going to hell.The Vermont independent, who is Jewish but  not particularly religious,  grilled Russell Vought, nominee to be deputy director of the Office of Management and Budget, on Wednesday, focusing on an article he wrote that said Muslims  do not know God because they have rejected Jesus Christ his Son, and they stand condemned. Sanders asked if that view was Islamophobic, and if Jews also stand condemned.Vought responded that he is a Christian.  In your judgment, do you think that people who are not Christians are going to be condemned?  Sanders asked. Vought began to answer before Sanders interrupted, asking if that viewpoint was  respectful of other religions. National Review columnist David French writes that Sanders was  imposing a religious test for public office in direct violation of Article VI of the United States Constitution  and that he was objecting to  entirely orthodox Christian beliefs  about access to heaven.Constitutional scholars say Sanders, who said he will vote against Vought, may violate the spirit of the Constitution, but arguably not Article VI, which states:  no religious Test shall ever be required as a Qualification to any Office or public Trust under the United States. No senator should vote against a nominee based on his or her religion. It would violate the spirit if not the letter of the Constitution. But senators can vote against nominees for any reason or no reason at all. There would be no legal consequence, and the nominee would have no forum for complaint. Allan Vestal of Drake University Law School says the Constitution s religious-test ban  does not provide a mechanism for inquiring into the motivations of individual senators and representatives in the votes they cast. There is no constitutional constraint on yea or nay votes, so yes he can do it,  agrees Richard Epstein, a New York University law professor.So now Trump nominees will all be attacked for their religion? This is really dangerous territory.Read more: US News',\n",
       " 'MOSCOW (Reuters) - After U.S. charges against President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort, Washington should investigate “the Ukrainian trace”, the RIA news agency cited Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov as saying on Tuesday. Kiev “has information” about the 2016 U.S. presidential election, Lavrov told a news briefing, RIA reported. Federal investigators probing alleged Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. election, something Moscow denies, charged Manafort with money laundering on Monday.   Neither Trump nor his campaign was mentioned in the indictment against Manafort. The charges, some going back more than a decade, center on Manafort’s work for Ukraine. ',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump has been having a rough time lately and things came to a head on Thursday when James Comey testified before Congress regarding the  president s  attempts to obstruct justice. Judging by Friday s press conference, it seems that things are really starting to get to Trump.During a press conference with Romanian President Klaus Iohannis, Trump completely melted down on live television. He debated out loud whether to call on  one of the killer networks  who are so mean to him with their  fake news  and finally called on the Washington Times  Dave Boyer and warned him to be nice.Boyer asked Trump about Comey s testimony, wondering if there really are tapes that could settle the whole obstruction of justice matter. Trump responded just as you would expect him to.No collusion, no obstruction. He s a leaker,  Trump said.He then implied that Comey had committed perjury, lying to Congress about him while under oath. Frankly, James Comey confirmed a lot of what I said, and some of the things that he said just weren t true,  he said, seemingly wanting it both ways. Trump denied Comey s accusation that he had pressured the FBI director to drop the investigation into Mike Flynn s Russian ties and asked him to pledge loyalty. But he added that it would have been okay to do even if he had, which he hadn t. (Insert eye roll here.)Boyer then asked the  president  if he would testify under oath to tell his side of the story and Trump said that he would be  100 percent  willing to do so. But the rest of Trump s answer was enough to make the entire country do a collective facepalm.I hardly know the man. I m not going to say I want you to pledge allegiance. Who would do that? Who would ask a man to pledge allegiance under oath? I mean think of it? I hardy know the man. It doesn t make sense. No, I didn t say that and I didn t say the other.For the record, it was at this point that everyone sitting in the room watching the press conference with me screamed,  YOU  at the television. Trump also promised that we would be hearing more about the alleged tapes in a  short period of time. Trump is losing it. His temper tantrums on live tv just prove that his tenuous grasp on reality is slipping under the pressure.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson’s use of an alias email address while he was chief executive at Exxon Mobil Corp was “entirely proper,” attorneys representing the company said in a letter to a New York court on Thursday. New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman, who is investigating whether Exxon misled shareholders and the public about climate change, wrote to a judge on Monday accusing Exxon of not previously disclosing the alias and Tillerson’s communications through it.  Tillerson had used the alias email address while at the oil company to send and receive information related to climate change and other matters. \"It (alias email address) allowed a limited group of senior executives to send time-sensitive messages to Mr. Tillerson that received priority over the normal daily traffic that crossed the desk of a busy CEO. The purpose was efficiency, not secrecy,\" attorneys at the law firm Paul Weiss Rifkind Wharton & Garrison LLP said. (bit.ly/2ntj6mk) Had Tillerson set up the alias email address with the purpose of “secrecy,” emails to the account would have avoided any reference to Tillerson as the intended recipient, the attorneys said.  “Obtaining publicity, not information, appears to have been the real goal of the New York Attorney General’s March 13 letter,” the attorneys said.  The New York Attorney General’s March 13 letter asked the judge to order Exxon to explain whether documents from the alias email and 34 additional accounts assigned to other Exxon executives and board members had been preserved. Exxon has provided 2.5 million pages of documents in response to a subpoena from Schneiderman’s office, but those documents include only 160 emails from Exxon management. “More than 16 months after receiving our subpoena, Exxon is just now admitting it may not have preserved or produced the emails of its former CEO, who used an alias email account. We look forward to addressing these, and the other issues our letter raised, in court,” Amy Spitalnick, press secretary at the office of the New York attorney general, said in an email. ',\n",
       " 'AUGUSTA, Maine (Reuters) - Maine lawmakers killed a motion on Thursday that would have marked the first step toward impeaching Republican Governor Paul LePage, whose blunt comments have often infuriated adversaries. The motion, presented on Thursday morning by eight Democrats and one independent, called for the creation of a legislative committee to investigate at least eight “allegations of misconduct” against LePage. Lawmakers seeking LePage’s ouster contended he overstepped his authority when he threatened to withhold funds last year from a nonprofit that hired a political rival, among other charges. Legislators, including some of LePage’s critics in the Democratic-controlled state House of Representatives, voted 96-52 to postpone the motion indefinitely. “As I have said all along, this impeachment nonsense was nothing more than a political witch hunt that had absolutely no merit,” LePage said in a statement following the vote.     The vote came a week after LePage drew criticism for saying out-of-state drug dealers were coming to Maine and impregnating “white girls.” Critics called the comments racist, while LePage told reporters he had misspoken. The majority of Democrats who spoke during a three hour-long House debate favored an investigation of LePage’s actions, but Republicans said the allegations against LePage would set the bar for impeachment proceedings too low. “What is going to be the standard, the threshold, next time that someone is disgruntled with the actions of a chief executive?” asked Republican state Representative Ken Fredette. LePage has acknowledged threatening to withhold funding from a charter school for troubled youths, after it hired House Speaker Mark Eves, a Democrat, as president. LePage said he felt Eves was unqualified and had been offered the job as a political favor.  Maine Attorney General Janet Mills, a Democrat often at odds with LePage, reviewed the charges but found no basis for a criminal investigation. Since taking office in 2011 as a favorite of the conservative Tea Party movement, LePage has often engaged in a war of words with political opponents. He has called Eves a “hack” and often refers to the legislators as “corrupt.” No Maine governor has ever been impeached. Nationally, state officials are rarely impeached. Most recently, in 2009, Illinois Governor Rod Blagojevich was removed from office for attempting to sell then President-elect Barack Obama’s vacated Senate seat for cash. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON/HAGERSTOWN, Md. (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday fired his chief strategist Steve Bannon in the latest White House shake-up, removing a far-right architect of his 2016 election victory and a driving force behind his nationalist and anti-globalization agenda. Bannon’s firing, a year and a day after Trump hired him as his campaign chief, put an abrupt end to the rabble-rousing political provocateur’s tumultuous tenure in a White House riven with rivalries and back-stabbing during which he clashed with more-moderate factions. He was instrumental in some of Trump’s most contentious policy moves including the ban on people from several Muslim-majority countries, abandoning the Paris climate accord, tearing up international trade agreements and cracking down on illegal immigration. He was no friend of the Republican political establishment and was loathed by liberals but was a darling of some of the president’s hard-line conservative supporters. White House officials said Trump had told new Chief of Staff John Kelly to crack down on the bickering and infighting, and that Bannon’s fate was sealed by comments published on  Wednesday in the American Prospect liberal magazine in which he spoke of targeting his adversaries within the administration. Trump, seven months into his presidency, has become increasingly isolated over his comments following white supremacist violence in the Virginia college town of Charlottesville last Saturday and his attacks on fellow Republicans. Some Republicans had even begun questioning Trump’s capacity to govern. As Trump came under fire from Republicans including two former presidents, and from business leaders and U.S. allies abroad, he faced mounting calls for Bannon’s ouster. Critics had accused Bannon of harboring anti-Semitic and white nationalist sentiments. “White House Chief of Staff John Kelly and Steve Bannon have mutually agreed today would be Steve’s last day,” White House spokeswoman Sarah Sanders said in a statement. Bannon returned to his post as executive chairman of right-wing Breitbart News on Friday afternoon, the website said. Prior to joining the Trump campaign, he had spearheaded Breitbart’s shift into a forum for the “alt-right,” a loose online confederation of neo-Nazis, white supremacists and anti-Semites. Bannon said his departure from the White House signals a major shift for the Trump agenda. “The Trump presidency that we fought for, and won, is over,” Bannon told the conservative Weekly Standard.  “I just think his ability to get anything done - particularly the bigger things, like the wall, the bigger, broader things that we fought for, it’s just gonna be that much harder,” Bannon said. He said he would use Breitbart to attack opponents of the  populist and nationalist agenda he championed, including establishment Republicans. “I am definitely going to crush the opposition,” Bannon said. He became the latest key figure to abruptly depart a Trump White House that has been chaotic from its first days and already has lost a chief of staff, a national security adviser, two communications directors and a chief spokesman. Trump’s presidency also has been dogged by ongoing investigations in Congress and a special counsel named by the Justice Department into potential collusion between his presidential campaign and Russia, something both Trump and Moscow deny. Bannon, 63, is a former U.S. Navy officer, Goldman Sachs investment banker and Hollywood movie producer. He had been in a precarious position before but Trump opted to keep him, in part because he had played a major role in Trump’s November 2016 election victory over Democrat Hillary Clinton and was backed by many of the president’s most loyal rank-and-file supporters. Democrats cheered Bannon’s departure. “Steve Bannon’s firing is welcome news,” said Nancy Pelosi, the top House of Representatives Democrat. “The Trump Administration must not only purge itself of the remaining white supremacists on staff, but abandon the bigoted ideology that clearly governs its decisions.” Wall Street indexes and the U.S. dollar ended a volatile session lower after a week of drama in Washington intensified doubts about Trump’s ability to deliver on policy objectives such as tax cuts. After a late-morning boost following reports of Bannon’s ouster, the dollar and U.S. equities lost ground. Bannon felt a close ideological connection to Trump’s populist tendencies and “America First” message. Like Trump, he has also expressed deep skepticism concerning ongoing American military involvement in Iraq and Afghanistan. The decision to fire Bannon could undermine Trump’s support among far-right voters but might ease tensions within the White House and with party leaders. Republicans control the White House and both chambers of Congress but have been unable to pass major legislative goals including a healthcare overhaul. Trump ran into trouble after saying anti-racism demonstrators in Charlottesville were as responsible for the violence as the neo-Nazis and white supremacists who instigated the protests, and that there were “very fine people” among both groups. Those remarks sparked rebukes from fellow Republicans, top corporate executives and some close allies. Bannon’s departure removes a large source of friction on the White House staff, but does not herald a significant shift by Trump toward the center on major policy issues, three administration officials said. “A good deal of what was attributed to Bannon, for example on China trade and restricting immigration, and the border wall, all came before Bannon joined the campaign and would have happened without him,” said one White House official, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Bannon has been a hawk on China, urging a tougher line on trade to correct a huge trade imbalance and dismissive of recent efforts to try to elicit Beijing’s help to rein in North Korea. In his comments to American Prospect, Bannon said the United States was in an economic war with China.     A second official said the biggest winners from Bannon’s departure are national security adviser H.R. McMaster; Gary Cohn, Trump’s chief economic adviser; and Trump’s daughter Ivanka and her husband, Jared Kushner. Bannon’s departure cast a cloud over the future of the group of allies he had brought into the White House, such as Sebastian Gorka. Some conservative activists expressed disappointment in Bannon’s ouster. Republicans were largely quiet, though moderate Republican congresswoman Ileana Ros-Lehtinen said she was glad Bannon was out but that the administration “must work to build bridges, not destroy them.” By the time Trump had hired Bannon as campaign manager, the real estate magnate had already vanquished his Republican opponents for the party’s presidential nomination. Asked about Bannon on Tuesday, Trump called him “a friend of mine” but downplayed his contribution to his election victory. “Mr. Bannon came on very late. You know that. I went through 17 senators, governors and I won all the primaries. Mr. Bannon came on very much later than that. And I like him. He is a good man. He is not a racist,” Trump said. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump officially announced Sonny Perdue as his choice for secretary of agriculture on Thursday, selecting a former Georgia governor over candidates from the Midwest states that dominate U.S. agricultural exports. Perdue, who was on Trump’s agricultural advisory committee during his presidential campaign, has yet to be confirmed in the post by the Republican-led Senate. He was elected to two terms as governor of Georgia, a leading producer of cotton and peanuts, serving from 2003 to 2011. Before that, he was a state senator, representing a rural swath of the state about 100 miles (160 km) south of Atlanta. “From growing up on a farm to being governor of a big agriculture state, he has spent his whole life understanding and solving the challenges our farmers face,” Trump said in a statement. Trump takes office on Friday. At least one Midwestern Senator raised questions about Perdue’s preparedness. Senator Chuck Grassley, a Republican from the top corn and soybean state of Iowa, tweeted: “I’m interested in how MidWest Ag will hv a seat at the table.” Key issues facing the agricultural community include trade and immigration. Georgia accounted for just 2 percent of total U.S. agriculture exports in 2015. Ranking 15th among all states in the value of its agricultural production, it generated $9.122 billion in commodity receipts, according to USDA data. Iowa ranked second with $27.674 billion. California is top, with $47.008 billion. Perdue acknowledged the concerns in an email to Trump’s agricultural advisory committee. “While I know some may be disappointed over regional or geographical concerns, I promise each of you I will diligently apply myself to learn all I can regarding the needs and challenges in this vast, wonderful industry we call American Agriculture, or nature’s factories,” Perdue said in a email to the advisory committee. Grassley, whose Midwest state helped deliver Trump the presidency, stressed in a statement the need for the secretary to understand farming in the Midwest, “the strength of American agriculture.” Trade is seen as critical to reviving a moribund farm economy, where incomes have been falling with lower grain prices. Farm incomes in 2016 are expected to have hit their lowest levels since 2009. Agriculture relies heavily on seasonal and casual labor and farmers are concerned tough immigration rules could make it harder to find workers while raising costs. Trump has raised tensions on immigration with his pledge to build a wall at the Mexican-U.S. border. Four of the past five agriculture secretaries have come from Midwest states. Perdue, if he is confirmed, would be the first from a southern state since Mike Espy, who was from Mississippi and served from January 1993 to December 1994.  Perdue, who holds a doctorate in veterinary medicine and served in the U.S. Air Force, founded a grain and fertilizer business in Georgia. “I’m going to champion the concerns of American agriculture and work tirelessly to solve the issues facing our farm families in this new role,” he said in a statement. Perdue’s cousin David Perdue is serving his first term representing Georgia in the U.S. Senate. The nominee is not related to the late chicken magnate Frank Perdue. ',\n",

Nunes, whose committee is investigating potential ties between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia, visited the White House the night before announcing he had information indicating Trump associates may have been subject to some level of intelligence activity before Trump took office on Jan. 20. “Chairman Nunes is falling down on the job and seems to be more interested in protecting the president than in seeking the truth,” Schumer said in a Senate speech.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - A powerful Senate committee blasted the Trump administration on Friday in a report accompanying its spending plan for the State Department, saying its approach to foreign policy weakens U.S. standing in the world. On Thursday, the Senate Appropriations Committee voted 31-0 for legislation allocating more than $51 billion for the State Department and foreign operations, nearly $11 billion more than requested by President Donald Trump’s administration. In the report released on Friday accompanying the legislation, the committee criticized the administration’s request to cut spending on such operations by 30 percent from the year ending on Sept. 30, 2017. “The lessons learned since September 11, 2001, include the reality that defense alone does not provide for American strength and resolve abroad. Battlefield technology and firepower cannot replace diplomacy and development,” it read. “The administration’s apparent doctrine of retreat, which also includes distancing the United States from collective and multilateral dispute resolution frameworks, serves only to weaken America’s standing in the world,” it said. Senator Lindsey Graham, the Republican chairman of the State and Foreign Operations subcommittee, which wrote the bill, said on Thursday that he had asked for more details from the White House about its spending plans. “We’ve got nothing back,” he said. Senator Patrick Leahy, the top subcommittee Democrat, called the “soft power” work of the State Department “absolutely essential.” Democrats and many of Trump’s fellow Republicans have blasted his budget request since it was released earlier this year. Congress, not the administration, controls spending. The administration says the State Department would be more effective if it were run more efficiently, arguing that the country needs to cut in other areas to fund a large increase in military spending. The bill passed by the Appropriations Committee is still several steps from becoming law. It must pass the Senate, and be reconciled with legislation passed by the House of Representatives, and then signed by Trump - or garner enough votes to override a Trump veto. The bill passed by the Senate committee on Thursday departed from Trump policy in other ways, including approving funding for the U.N. climate body and rejecting prohibitions on funding for international organizations that perform or provide counseling on abortions. Those measures, however, stand little chance in the House. Although Republicans control both chambers of Congress, conservative Republicans most skeptical about climate change and opposed to abortion exert more control in the House than in the Senate. ',\n",
       " '    (Welcome) to America We hope you enjoy our benefits. Please feel free to NOT assimilate  Coming soon: Press 1 for English, 2 for Spanish and 3 for Arabic The Obama Administration is on pace to issue more than a million green cards to migrants from majority-Muslim countries, according to an analysis of Department of Homeland Security data.A chart released by the Senate Subcommittee on Immigration and the National Interest Friday details the surge in immigration to the U.S. from majority-Muslim countries since President Barack Obama took office in 2009.Specifically, in the first six fiscal years of Obama s presidency (FY2009   FY2014), his administration issued 832,014 green cards to migrants majority-Muslim countries, the most of which were issued to migrants from Pakistan (102,000), Iraq (102,000), Bangladesh (90,000), Iran (85,000), Egypt (56,000), and Somalia (37,000).The total 832,014 new permanent residents do not include migrants on temporary, nonimmigrant visas   which allow foreign nationals to come to the U.S. temporarily for work, study, tourism and the like. As the subcommittee notes, the number also does not include those migrants who overstayed the terms of their visas.Regardless, as the subcommittee explained in its analysis, the U.S. is playing host to immigrants from majority Muslim countries at an increasing pace.Between FY 2013 and FY 2014, the number of green cards issued to migrants from Muslim-majority countries increased dramatically   from 117,423 in FY 2013, to 148,810 in FY 2014, a nearly 27 percent increase. Throughout the Obama Administration s tenure, the United States has issued green cards to an average of 138,669 migrants from Muslim-majority countries per year, meaning that it is nearly certain the United States will have issued green cards to at least 1.1 million migrants from Muslim-majority countries on the President s watch. It has also been reported that migration from Muslim-majority countries represents the fastest growing class of migrants.Green cards, or Lawful Permanent Residency, puts immigrants on the path to citizenship and allows for lifetime residency, federal benefits, and work authorization. Included in the totals are refugees, who are required to apply for a green card after one year of residency in the U.S. Unlike other types of immigrants, refugees are immediately eligible for welfare benefits including Temporary Assistance to Needy Families (TANF), food stamps, and Medicaid.

       " 'SITTWE, Myanmar (Reuters) - Myanmar s army chief called on Thursday for people internally displaced by violence in Rakhine State to go home and rebuild communities, but he made no mention of 422,000 Rohingya Muslims who fled to Bangladesh to escape his force s operations. Senior General Min Aung Hlaing, in a major speech on his plans for Rakhine state on his first visit there since the latest strife erupted, said the military had handled the situation as best as it could after a wave of coordinated attacks by Rohingya insurgents on Aug. 25. The United Nations has said the military response to the insurgent attacks is ethnic cleansing aimed at pushing the Rohingya Muslim community out of Buddhist-majority Myanmar. Myanmar denies that, saying its forces are waging a legitimate campaign against Muslim terrorists who have been attacking and torching villages of Buddhists and other non-Muslims, some 30,000 of whom were internally displaced. Min Aung Hlaing did not mention the accusation of ethnic cleansing in his speech to business people, officials and some of the displaced, in Sittwe, the state capital.  Regarding the rehabilitation of villages of our national races, for the national races who fled their homes, first of all they must go back to their places,  he said.  National races  is a Myanmar term referring to members of officially recognized indigenous ethnic groups who make up the diverse nation. The Rohingya are not recognized as a  national race , and are instead seen as illegal immigrants and denied citizenship. Animosity between Buddhists in Rakhine state and the Rohingya goes back generations, but has seethed in recent years, fueled in part by a surge of Buddhist nationalism since nearly five decades of strict military rule came to an end.  The important thing is to have our people in the region. It s necessary to have control of our region with our national races,  Min Aung Hlaing said.  We can t do anything if there are no people from our national races ... that is their rightful place.  Min Aung Hlaing did not refer to the return of Muslims to their villages in the north of the state, almost half of which have been abandoned and torched. The crisis has drawn international condemnation and calls from the United Nations and U.S. President Donald Trump for the military to stop the violence and support diplomatic efforts for a long-term solution for the Rohingya. Myanmar leader Aung San Suu Kyi, in her first address to the nation on the crisis on Tuesday, said Myanmar was ready to start a verification process to take back refugees, under a 1993 arrangement with Bangladesh.  Refugees from this country will be accepted without any problem,  she said. Min Aung Hlaing did not mention the return of refugees from Bangladesh.    ',\n",

The Florida attorney general, who was facing a tough re-election campaign, had recently decided not to investigate Trump University.Trump did not write a check to the attorney general that night. The previous fall, his personal foundation had given $25,000 to a pro-Bondi PAC. But by hosting her fundraiser at Mar-a-Lago and bringing in some of his own star power, Trump provided Bondi s campaign with a nice financial boost.The Huffington Post also reports that while Trump has billed the RNC $140,000 per event to use his mansion, he only charged the Republican Party of Florida $4,855.65. That means that Trump stands to make a windfall simply by controlling the flow of campaign donor money to his own enterprises.News of the interlocking relationship between Trump and Bondi (she has done campaign rallies for him) underscores how the national media has ignored or played down actual stories of Trump and his involvement with corruption. Instead they have banged the drums on the Clinton Foundation, making allegations of wrong-doing based on the potential and  optics  of the far-reaching charity the Clintons put in place.Trump is also implicated in similar behavior in Texas. The attorney general there dropped looking into Trump University a little after he gave him a financial donation.Featured image via Flickr',\n",

       " 'President Barack Obama recently said he told Russian President Vladimir Putin to  knock it off  back in September. Obama s alleged demand was a result of the supposed  hacking  of the computers of the Democratic National Committee (DNC), in what has been presented as an attempt by the Russians to influence the outcome of the presidential election in favor of Donald Trump.This alleged effort by the Russians was even cited as a reason to block Trump s election in the Electoral College. Some presidential electors even asked for an intelligence briefing before they cast their votes, so they would know exactly what Putin s government did. Of course, almost all those asking for the briefing were Democrat electors already voting for Trump s Democrat opponent, Hillary Clinton, so it could be dismissed as just a political ploy.But, if the Russians did covertly attempt to alter the outcome of the presidential election, it would seem somewhat hypocritical of the U.S. government to take umbrage. After all, the United States, under several presidents both Democrat and Republican, has repeatedly interfered in foreign elections, both covertly and overtly, multiple times in the past several decades.Most recently, President Obama told British voters that they better not vote for Brexit   the public vote for the United Kingdom to leave the European Union (EU)   or they would find themselves  at the back of the queue [line]  in getting any sort of trade deal with the United States. Of course, with Obama leaving office on January 20, he would not be making any trade deals with anyone much longer anyway.Here is the video of Barack Obama attempting to influence the Brexit vote by threatening to put them at the back of the que:Obama went on to say,  I think this [membership in the EU] makes you guys bigger players,  at a joint press conference with then-British Prime Minister David Cameron, a staunch supporter of remaining in the EU. In the end, the British did not take Obama s  advice,  and opted to leave the EU.It was not the first time that the Obama administration attempted to determine the outcome of a foreign election. In the last Israeli election, the Obama State Department funneled hundreds of thousands of dollars in taxpayer money to the opposition of Israel s Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. The Senate Permanent Subcommittee on Investigations found that the State Department and a group called One Voice coordinated political activities   including the building of a voter database, the training of activists, and the hiring of a political consulting firm tied to President Obama himself.Watch here:Yet, the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) has charged that Russia interfered with the 2016 U.S. presidential election by releasing e-mails damaging to the Clinton campaign effort. But why is it acceptable for the United States government to interfere in another nation s election campaign efforts, but not acceptable for other countries   including Russia   to (allegedly) interfere in U.S. elections?The Brexit vote and Israeli election are not the only times this has happened. Don Levin of Carnegie Mellon University has documented 81 times the United States has attempted to influence presidential elections in other countries between 1946 and 2000. And then, of course, there are the military coups backed by the United States and the regime changes imposed by military actions. In his study, Levin described  intervention  as including funding of the election campaigns of selected political parties, the dissemination of political propaganda, training of local activists in political techniques, and public comments by high-ranking U.S. officials, favoring or disfavoring one side or the other. He also included public threats to withdraw foreign aid, or even promises to provide it if one side were to be elected.For entire story: The American',\n",
       " 'This story is from 2006 and is the first in a long series of Hillary s lies that we ll be exposing over the next couple of months For more than a decade, one piece of Senator Hillary Rodham Clinton s informal biography has been that she was named for Sir Edmund Hillary, the conqueror of Mount Everest. The story was even recounted in Bill Clinton s autobiography.But yesterday, Mrs. Clinton s campaign said she was not named for Sir Edmund after all. It was a sweet family story her mother shared to inspire greatness in her daughter, to great results I might add,  said Jennifer Hanley, a spokeswoman for the campaign.In May 1953, Sir Edmund and his Sherpa guide, Tenzing Norgay, became the first men to reach the summit of Mount Everest. In 1995, shortly after meeting Sir Edmund, Mrs. Clinton said that her mother, Dorothy Rodham, had long told her she was named for the famous mountaineer.  It had two l s, which is how she thought she was supposed to spell Hillary,  Mrs. Clinton said at the time, after meeting Sir Edmund.  So when I was born, she called me Hillary, and she always told me it s because of Sir Edmund Hillary. Even though Bill Clinton repeated the story in his 2004 autobiography,  My Life,  Hillary Clinton did not mention it in her own autobiography,  Living History,  which was published in 2003.But one big hole has been poked in the story over the years, both in cyberspace and elsewhere: Sir Edmund became famous only after climbing Everest in 1953. Mrs. Clinton, as it happens, was born in 1947. Via: NYT',\n",
       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - Tahrir al-Sham, an alliance of jihadist factions in Syria, on Saturday decried Turkey-backed Syrian rebel factions planning an operation in the northwestern Idlib province where it dominates, saying it would  not be a picnic  for them.   The lions of jihad and martyrdom are waiting to pounce on them,  it added in a statement posted on a social media site.  Earlier on Saturday Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan said Syrian rebel fighters were preparing to launch  a serious operation  in Idlib backed by Turkish forces from inside Turkey s borders.  The operation comes after an agreement last month between Turkey, Russia and Iran to set up a  de-escalation zone  in northwest Syria where Idlib is located to reduce warfare there.  Erdogan said Russia, which backs the Syrian government against rebel groups, would support the operation, but rebels taking part said Russia s role was only in areas controlled by the Syrian government.  Tahrir al-Sham s statement described the rebel groups involved as traitors, accusing them of working with Russia and the Syrian government, but without mentioning Turkey.  ',\n",

All of this pomp and circumstance took place in a country where Obama pulled our troops and declared he  ended the war in Iraq. Here is Barack Hussein Obama bragging about  ending the war in Iraq  and then wonders aloud to the press why they keep asking him about pulling out of Iraq like  as if it was my decision. Here is President George W.

And now: Frustrated that coverage of the war against the Islamic State in Iraq and the Levant isn t reflecting reality on the ground, senior Obama administration officials are urging television networks to update their footage of the radical militant group.Senior State Department and Pentagon officials have begun contacting television network reporters to ask them to stop using  B-roll    stock footage that appears on screen while reporters and commentators talk   showing ISIL at the peak of its strength last summer. We are urging broadcasters to avoid using the familiar B-roll that we ve all seen before, file footage of ISIL convoys operating in broad daylight, moving in large formations with guns out, looking to wreak havoc,  said Emily Horne, spokeswoman for retired Gen. John Allen, the State Department s special envoy leading the international coalition against ISIL. It s inaccurate   that s no longer how ISIL moves,  Horne said.  A lot of that footage is from last summer before we began tactical strikes. The effort is ad hoc for now, with U.S. officials approaching correspondents from several networks in informal settings. Representatives from CNN, NBC, Fox, or ABC did not respond to multiple requests for comment. A source at CBS said they hadn t heard from the administration yet regarding their footage. Since the U.S. began conducting air strikes against ISIL positions and convoys last August, America and its allies have dropped thousands of bombs against the group in Iraq and Syria. U.S. officials say ISIL fighters can no longer congregate in daylight or move in large convoys that are easily spotted   and struck   from above.A more accurate image, said Col. Steven Warren, a Pentagon spokesman, would be  one Toyota speeding down the road by itself at night with its headlights off. Via: Politico',\n",

       " 'BAGHDAD/MOSUL, Iraq (Reuters) - Iraq will lobby against new travel limits to the United States by Iraqis, arguing both countries need to uphold their fight against Islamic State (IS), Iraqi parliamentarians said on Sunday. The Iraqi government has so far declined comment on an executive order signed by new U.S. President Donald Trump on Friday that suspends the entry of travelers from Iran, Iraq, Libya, Somalia, Sudan, Syria and Yemen for at least 90 days. The order stirred angry reactions in Iraq, where more than 5,000 U.S. troops are deployed to help Iraqi and regional Kurdish forces in the war against IS insurgents.  Some members of parliament said Iraq should retaliate with similar measures against the United States. “Iraq is in the front line of the war on terrorism ... and it is unfair that the Iraqis are treated in this way,” parliament’s foreign affairs committee said in a statement. “We call on the Iraqi government to retaliate for the decision taken by the U.S. administration,” it added after a session on Sunday in Baghdad. Baghdad plans to lobby Washington to review the decision, according to two lawmakers who declined to be identified.  One of them told Reuters that the government will “explain that Iraq as a sovereign country will be forced to apply similar treatment, and that would affect negatively cooperation, including military cooperation”, in the conflict with IS. Popular Mobilization, a coalition of mainly Shi’ite Muslim paramilitary groups armed and trained by Iran to fight Islamic State, urged Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi’s government to expel U.S. nationals. Influential Shi’ite cleric Moqtada al-Sadr said on Sunday American citizens should leave Iraq. “It would be arrogance for you (Americans) to enter Iraq and other countries freely while barring them entrance to your country ... and therefore you should get your nationals out,” he said on his website.  The U.S.-led coalition is providing critical air and ground support to Iraqi forces in the ongoing battle to wrest Mosul, the largest city in northern Iraq, from Islamic State.  Mosul is the last major Iraqi city still under the control of Islamic State, the ultra-hardline Sunni group that declared a self-styled “caliphate” over parts of Iraq and Syria in 2014. The government announced on Tuesday that Iraqi forces had recaptured all of Mosul east of the Tigris River that splits the city, and were girding for an onslaught on the jihadists on the western bank. Meanwhile, an Iraqi who worked four years as a translator for U.S. forces in the hope of obtaining a Special Immigration Visa (SIV) felt betrayed by the Trump administration’s decision and said he now feared for his life. The man said he was hired by U.S. forces after he tipped them off about a house where insurgents were making car bombs in Mosul. He said that while employed by the Americans, he saved the life of a serviceman after U.S. troops came under militant attack in Mosul.  “My life is (now) in danger,” said the translator, who spoke in eastern Mosul and asked not to be  identified or photographed. He told Reuters he used to consider the Americans to be “brothers but I don’t trust those guys anymore”.  He added that bureaucratic and personal problems delayed his applications to the U.S. Special Immigrant Visa program designed for those employed by the U.S. military and U.S. civilian agencies until their withdrawal from Iraq in 2011.    “Please, please, please get me out of this country,” he said. “There are currently fewer than 500 Iraqis in the SIV pipeline,” said a State Department official. Overall, “more than 20,000 Iraqis have received immigrations benefits” from this program, he added.  Among the Iraqis barred from traveling to the U.S. over the past 48 hours was Fuad Sharef’s family, who embarked on the trip after selling their home and quitting their jobs and their school. The parents and their three children were barred on Saturday from boarding a connecting flight in Cairo to New York. Speaking by phone from Cairo airport, Sharef said the family was still in shock for having been detained there, their passports confiscated and being forced to go back to Iraq. ',\n",

       " ' (In this July 27 story, corrects paragraph 7 to reflect that Zarda died in a BASE-jumping accident, not a skydiving accident) By Daniel Wiessner (Reuters) - The Trump administration told a U.S. appeals court that federal law does not ban discrimination against gay employees, a sharp reversal of the position former President Barack Obama took on a key civil rights issue. The U.S. Department of Justice, in a friend of the court brief, told the 2nd U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in Manhattan on Wednesday that Congress never intended Title VII, which bans sex discrimination in the workplace, to apply to gay workers.  The department also said the court owed no deference to the U.S. Equal Employment Opportunity Commission, a federal agency that enforces Title VII and has argued since 2012 that the law bans discrimination on the basis of sexual orientation.  The brief came hours after President Donald Trump said he would ban transgender people from serving in the military. That would reverse a 2016 policy adopted by Obama.  Justice Department spokesman Devin O’Malley said the brief was consistent with rulings by 10 federal appeals courts and “reaffirms the Department’s fundamental belief that the courts cannot expand the law beyond what Congress has provided.” The department’s brief was in support of New York skydiving company Altitude Express Inc in a lawsuit filed by a former employee, Donald Zarda.  Zarda claimed he lost his job as a skydiving instructor after he told a customer he was gay and she complained. He died in a BASE-jumping accident after filing the lawsuit. In April, a three-judge 2nd Circuit panel dismissed Zarda’s case, citing a prior ruling that said discrimination against gay workers is not a form of sex discrimination under Title VII. The full court, which can overturn the prior decision, agreed in May to review the case. The issue could reach the U.S. Supreme Court in a different case brought by a former security guard at a Georgia hospital who claims she was harassed and forced to quit because she is gay.  Earlier this month, LGBT rights group Lambda Legal, which represents the former security guard, said it would ask the high court to review the case.  On Wednesday, the Justice Department said employers engage in sex discrimination only when they treat male and female workers differently. Objecting to homosexuality does not depend on sex, the department said, but on moral or religious beliefs. “Of course, if an employer fired only gay men but not gay women (or vice versa), that would be prohibited by Title VII,” the department wrote, “but precisely because it would be discrimination based on sex, not sexual orientation.” Zarda’s lawyer, Gregory Antollino, said on Thursday that the department was making the same arguments the Supreme Court rejected in cases involving discrimination against workers in interracial relationships.

       " 'Pastor Stephen L. Anderson of Faithful Word Baptist Church in Tempe, Arizona, is a terrible human being. In 2014, he made the case that AIDS can be eliminated if we just wiped all the  f*ggots  off the face of the planet. Naturally, given his many unhinged ravings about the LGBT community, a group he calls (without cause)  pedophiles,  and a wide array of other offensive language, Anderson was quite pleased after learning that  50 sodomites  died, and another 50 were injured, in a targeted terrorist attack against the gay community in Orlando.Anderson says that this is  good news  because  there s 50 less pedophiles in the world.  The  Christian  pastor praised the shooter for eliminating his victims because they we  just disgusting homosexuals at a gay bar.  While he says he would never advocate violence (except for the time he prayed that President Obama would  die and go to hell and his statement that all gay people should be murdered, of course), Anderson is clear that the Muslim man who killed all those people was simply following the Bible (what?):Now let me just be real clear: I ve never advocated for violence. I don t believe in, you know, taking the law into our own hands. I would never go in and shoot up a gay bar   so-called. I don t believe it s right for us to just be a vigilante  But I will say this: The Bible says that homosexuals should be put to death, in Leviticus 20:13. Obviously, it s not right for somebody to just, you know, shoot up the place, because that s not going through the proper channels. But these people all should have been killed, anyway, but they should have been killed through the proper channels, as in they should have been executed by a righteous government that would have tried them, convicted them, and saw them executed. Because, in Leviticus 20:13, God s perfect law, he put the death penalty on murder, and he also put the death penalty on homosexuality. That s what the Bible says, plain and simple.While he is happy that fifty people were murdered in the name of his god (though many Christians would dispute that they share a god with Muslims) after an extremist saw two men kissing and flew off the rails, Anderson says that there are some drawbacks   like those awful liberals who think that this attack is one of the many examples that we need reasonable firearm regulations, and those who will denounce hate speech:But the bad news is that this is now gonna be used, I m sure, to push for gun control, where, you know, law-abiding normal Americans are not gonna be allowed to have guns for self-defense. And then I m sure it s also gonna be used to push an agenda against so-called  hate speech.  So Bible-believing Christian preachers who preach what the Bible actually says about homosexuality   that it s vile, that it s disgusting, that they re reprobates   you know, we re gonna be blamed.Like,  It s all extremism! It s not just the Muslims, it s the Christians!  I m sure that that s coming. I m sure that people are gonna start attacking, you know, Bible-believing Christians now, because of what this guy did. I m not sad about it, I m not gonna cry about it. Because these 50 people in a gay bar that got shot up, they were gonna die of AIDS, and syphilis, and whatever else. They were all gonna die early, anyway, because homosexuals have a 20-year shorter life-span than normal people, anyway,  Anderson says.  At least these dangerous predators, these dangerous filthy pedophiles at this gay bar, at least they re off the streets. I m just trying to look at the bright side,  he concluded before wishing God s blessings on viewers.If there was any justice in this world, God would have spared the victims and taken Anderson instead.

       " 'The definition of rape came under fire in Oklahoma Wednesday when a the state s high court ruled that a girl who had accused a boy of sexually assaulting her was too drunk to be a reliable witness and dismissed the charges against the boy she says raped her while she was either too intoxicated or unconscious. She was 14 at the time of the assault and he was 17.The boy claims that the girl, who was four times past the legal limit to drive, engaged in a consensual oral act with him. The Court of Criminal Appeals agreed with him, stating that  force can t be substituted with intoxication under the [forced sodomy] law.  Prosecutors are furious, because the boy gets a walk, and while the court also said,  We will not, in order to justify prosecution of a person for an offense, enlarge a statute beyond the fair meaning of its language,  it stated it in an  unpublished opinion,  meaning the case can t be cited as precedent.That means that nothing has changed. The court has given its opinion on what some poor drunk teenage girl forever changed because a poor decision led to a boy who is legally an adult in many states raped her and got away with it. By saying it isn t precedent means they certainly don t want to close the door on the fact that people are raped, just not for this girl, who they obviously believe could have possibly been responsible for such a thing at 14-years-old. They don t make good decisions when they re stone cold sober, nevermind when you ply them with booze.From what s available, the boy, who had a friend with him, gave the girl a ride home because she was so drunk. He dropped his friend off first, who would testify that the girl was drifting in and out of consciousness, and somewhere between there and the girl s house his DNA ended up all over her and she has no memory of the encounter. The court said they wouldn t create a crime to prosecute one offender because the forcible sodomy law says you have to use force, not alcohol or by that logic, date rape drugs, to incapacitate and force yourself on your victim.Interpreting law is what a high court does. Does somebody really have to tell these idiots that rape is about control, not sex? Maybe they saw this one kid as some believable victim of a circumstance beyond his control, but what they ve done is fostered a rapist and given plenty of other young abusers -in-training a new something to think about. Until Oklahoma either changes the law or replaces the imbeciles on its high court who interpret it, it s a breeding ground for predatory behavior.Featured image from okhouse.gov',\n",

The repeal-only bill died when several Republican senators, including Lisa Murkowski of Alaska, voted no on a motion to advance the bill to the full Senate for debate.And the White House is not happy about that. They are very unhappy about it. Not only did Trump run over to Twitter to say that she  let the Republicans, and our country, down  Too bad!  but both of Alaska s senators also received calls from Secretary of the Interior Ryan Zinke, who proceeded to threaten her entire state over her vote. In essence, he threatened to withhold all kinds of funding from her state as punishment for her vote. According to the Alaska Post-Dispatch:Alaska Sen. Dan Sullivan (who voted  yes  on the motion) said the call from Zinke heralded a  troubling message. I m not going to go into the details, but I fear that the strong economic growth, pro-energy, pro-mining, pro-jobs and personnel from Alaska who are part of those policies are going to stop,  Sullivan said.Efforts and issues on the line include nominations of Alaskans to Interior posts, an effort to build a road out of King Cove through the Izembek National Wildlife Refuge, and future opportunities to drill in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge and expand drilling in the National Petroleum Reserve-Alaska, among other regulatory issues that are a priority for Murkowski and Sullivan.This is Trump trying to force members of Congress to bend to his will. It s a strong arm tactic that s beneath the Office of the President and patently disgusting to boot. It s reminiscent of a scene in Full Metal Jacket where Gunnery Sergeant Hartmann begins punishing his entire platoon for one private s ongoing problems during basic training.Raul Grijalva, a representative from Arizona, has called for an investigation into Zinke s threats against Alaska.

Instead of using the opportunity to condemn the growing, violent movement, he actually appeared to be condoning it. While paying tribute to the fallen officers for sacrificing their lives to protect others from a sniper, Mr. Obama also called on law enforcement agencies to root out bigotry. We have all seen this bigotry in our lives at some point,  Mr. Obama told an audience of several hundred at a concert hall in Dallas. None of us is entirely innocent. No institution is entirely immune. And that includes our police departments. We know this.  The officers   Michael Smith, Lorne Ahrens, Michael Krol, Brent Thompson and Patrick Zamarripa were killed by a black sniper who told police he targeted white officers during a Black Lives Matter protest.The day after the memorial service for the Dallas cops who were murdered by a Black Lives Matter supporter, President Barack Obama invited BLM leaders to the White House for a private meeting:It should come as no surprise to anyone that the most recent assassination of an innocent cop was at the hands of Hillary Clinton supporter Alexander Bonds, given her outreach to the Black Lives Matter terror group during her campaign. Wikileaks even released an email showing how radical group Center For American Progress was advising her on how to fake empathy for parents of kids killed by cops. Wikileaks released an email from Center for American Progress President Neera Tanden, coaching Hillary on how to best gain the trust of the Black community by going directly to the victims being held up by Black Lives Matter movement as heroes, and faking empathy with the parents. She also mentions it would be a good idea to use the idea that their grief should be magnified because it happened at the hands of law enforcement officers (the state).Given all that has happened over the last few days with the Black Lives Matter movement, I thought it would be a good idea for Hillary to pen an op ed, discussing the pain people feel as parents at the loss of their children to these incidents of police brutality, how as a parent, she knows that pain is magnified because it happens at the hands of the state, and her commitment to solve the problem as President.Given her strong words on Charlotte, it could serve as a reminder that she gets it that racism isn t like everything else.

He said police in Oakland, Calif., were wrong to stop a child riding a bicycle.Authorities are trying to piece together a motive after NYPD officer and mother of three Miosotis Familia was brutally gunned down in cold blood by Alexander Bonds early Monday morning while she sat in a temporary headquarters vehicle at East 183rd Street and Morris Avenue in Fordham Heights.Bonds was subsequently killed by two other officers called to the scene while Familia died in hospital. This is absolutely an unprovoked attack,  said NYPD Commissioner James P. O Neill. Police say surveillance footage shows Bonds pulling up his hoodie before  purposefully  walking up to the vehicle and shooting through the passenger side. Speculation as to why 34-year-old Bonds, who had previously served seven years in prison for a Syracuse robbery, gunned down Familia has begun to center on his political beliefs.Bonds  Facebook page reveals that days before the presidential election, he posted a video of a woman alleging that voting machines were switching Hillary Clinton votes to Donald Trump.Watch video Bonds made below, where he tells his Facebook followers about his hate for cops. He calls police  faggots  and accuses them of raping children. He also says he s  up and ready  for the cops, using his time in jail as an example of how he got ready for them. He posted the words  Mad as hill  above the video.On the same day he urged people to  get mad  about the election and vote. When asked who he was voting for, Bonds responded that he couldn t vote (due to his felony conviction), but said people should vote for Hillary Clinton.Bonds also posted Malcolm X memes as well as videos of confrontations between black people and police officers. Previous ambush-style murders of police officers have been motivated by extremist anti-cop  Black Lives Matter -style rhetoric, as well as mass shootings of police officers like the Dallas massacre, which was celebrated by BLM sympathizers.

       " 'U.S. Rep. Tim Murphy, a staunch  pro-life  Republican representing Pennsylvania s 18th District, has resigned after being caught in a scandal which involves adultery and encouraging his mistress to get an abortion. After Rep. Tim Murphy (R-Pa.) was caught being a hypocrite of the highest order, he announced his resignation on Thursday after announcing his plan to retire after 2018. This afternoon I received a letter of resignation from Congressman Tim Murphy, effective October 21,  Speaker Paul Ryan said in a statement.  It was Dr. Murphy s decision to move on to the next chapter of his life, and I support it. Well, it wasn t exactly Murphy s decision really.House GOP leaders and senior Republicans pressured Murphy to step down, according to Politico.GOP sources familiar with Murphy s thinking said the married man initially believed he could weather the Pittsburgh Post-Gazette story revealing he had encouraged an abortion in texts he sent to his girlfriend, a psychologist half his age.However, in contrast to what Murphy thought, many senior Republicans did not believe he could weather the scandal  or should   until the end of his term.Several top Republicans said that Paul Ryan, who met with Murphy on Wednesday evening to discuss his future, also wanted him to step down.So really, anti-abortion Republicans aborted him from office because he was caught. GOP insiders also worried that more damaging stories could surface. And stories, in fact, were surfacing with allegations of being abusive toward his staff for years by yelling at aides and throwing folders around. Murphy reportedly berated his staff members as  worthless  and  stupid.  Murphy s chief of staff Susan Mosychuk reportedly punished staffers by making them take the stairs instead of the elevator if she thought they underperformed.Republicans didn t request his resignation because he was such a hypocritical jerkwad:Republicans believed the matter could become an ethics issue that would trigger an investigation and distract from GOP messaging. With Murphy set to resign later this month, any ethics probes would die before even getting started.One of the texts the Gazette obtained was by Shannon Edwards, a married forensic psychologist half his age with whom he was having an affair. And you have zero issue posting your pro-life stance all over the place when you had no issue asking me to abort our unborn child just last week when we thought that was one of the options,  wrote Edwards. Mrs. Edwards is now going through a divorce following the affair.Photo via Wikipedia. ',\n",

       " 'European nations have naively opened their borders to millions of Muslim males who have no intention of assimilating. As they make their way across Europe, police forces find themselves ill-equipped to handle the extreme increase in sexual assault and violence, so citizens are now finding themselves in a position where they are being forced to take matters into their own hands.A group of young concerned Germans made a video warning that they would no longer sit back and watch their culture and history being destroyed. The video can be viewed by clicking HERE.On February 4, 2015, we reported about a fast growing group of vigilantes who call themselves the  Soldiers of Odin. The self-styled  Soldiers of Odin  march in a mob, wearing bomber jackets with their logo on the back. They have vowed to take direct action to  protect their wives, girlfriends and children  after a migrant influx to the liberal Scandinavian country. Persons linked to Islamist groups in Oslo say that they have formed a group called  Soldiers of Allah .Via a central source in the Islamist environment, the Norwegian newspaper VG has received a statement, and photographs of the planned uniform.The group has been named  Jundullaah    which translates to  Soldiers of Allah . In response to the group of unbelievers in Soldiers of Odin, who are patrolling the streets, we Muslims have chosen to create a group to patrol the streets, initially in the capital Oslo, to forbid evil and call for the good,  says the statement.The planned  uniform , is decorated with the black flag of the terrorist organization Islamic State (IS) on the back, with a small logo on the chest.On Tuesday, Labour s Muslim deputy chairman, Hadia Tajik, said that the Soldiers of Odin defy Norway s rules on private security businesses and she tried to illustrate the problem as follows:  It is as if the Islamists would be the uniformed ones, take to the streets and call themselves guards or vigilantes. It is very undesirable and unfortunate for our country, devastating, said Tajik.Now it s exactly what is about to happen.Great tip, Tajik.The information that Islamists in Oslo are in the process of establishing a group, is also confirmed by the temporary spokesman of the Prophet s ummah who calls himself  Abu Arijon.  He said that the plan is to start in Oslo, then Drammen and T nsberg.Many of the people in  Soldiers of Allah  come from the environment around the Islamist group the Prophet s Ummah, where spokesman Ubaydullah Hussain currently is in custody and charged with recruiting for IS. Soldiers of Allah  inform in the statement themselves, that almost everyone in the group is on the  Watch List  of the Police Security Service (PST).  Is PST aware of the group  Soldiers of Allah  planning to patrol in Oslo?  We can not comment on individuals or individual groups, says senior adviser in PST, Siv Als n, to VG.So there it is. Regular street battles could soon be a reality in Norway. Soldiers of Odin against Soldiers of Allah, with the police in between. However, it will most likely not be started by the Soldiers of Odin, but the rabid Islamists in the soldiers of Allah. And then, even though the Soldiers of Odin claim to be a peaceful group, the Viking has clearly awaken   illustrated by the logo on the back. And being attacked by Islamists, they will have no other choice than to go berserk again, after a thousand years in hibernation.All hell is breaking loose in countries all across Europe. Are Americans paying attention, or has Obama s manufactured race war distracted us from his plan to seed Muslims in our small towns and communities across America through the US State Dept.

       " 'ALEXANDRIA, Va. (Reuters) - Congressman Steve Scalise, the No. 3 Republican in the U.S. House of Representatives, was in critical condition on Wednesday night after he and three others were shot as they practiced for a charity baseball game. The gunman, who had posted angry messages against President Donald Trump and other Republicans on social media, opened fire on a group of Republican lawmakers and colleagues at a baseball field in Alexandria, Virginia, outside Washington. He was wounded in a gunfight with Capitol Hill police at the scene and later died. Scalise was shot in the left hip, suffering broken bones, injuries to internal organs and severe bleeding.  He underwent surgery but would need further operations, the MedStar Washington Hospital Center said. “Rep. Steve Scalise, one of the truly great people, is in very tough shape - but he is a real fighter. Pray for Steve!” Trump said on Twitter after visiting the hospital on Wednesday night. The gunman, identified by police as 66-year-old James Hodgkinson from the St. Louis suburb of Belleville, Illinois,  fired repeatedly at the men playing on the baseball field on Wednesday morning.  Congressmen at the ballpark described hearing loud noises like the sound of firecrackers and 15 to 20 people lying on the ground and realizing they had only baseball bats to defend themselves against bullets. “When he started shooting, he was shooting to kill people. And thank God he wasn’t a very good shot,” said Representative Joe Barton, the Republican team’s manager. Also wounded were a congressional aide and one former aide who now works as a lobbyist, officials said. One Capitol Hill police officer suffered a gunshot wound and another officer twisted an ankle and was released from a hospital, police said. “It was not only chaotic but it was a combat situation,” Alexandria Police Chief Mike Brown told reporters. While police and the Federal Bureau of Investigation said it was too early to determine whether it was a deliberate political attack, the shooting intensified concerns about the sharp divide and bitter rhetoric in U.S. politics. FBI special agent Tim Slater declined to comment on whether the gunman had a vendetta against Republicans. “We continue to actively investigate the shooter’s motives, acquaintances and whereabouts that led to today’s incidents,”  Slater told reporters. No one else was in custody, he said. The gunman was believed to have been in the Alexandria area since March, Slater said. Investigators believe that the suspect had been living out of his vehicle. Wednesday’s shooting revived debate about gun rights in America. Virginia’s Democratic governor, Terry McAuliffe, urged gun control measures.  Scalise has been a strong opponent of gun control measures. Hodgkinson had raged against Trump on social media and was a member of anti-Republican groups on Facebook including, “The Road to Hell Is Paved With Republicans,” “Terminate The Republican Party,” and “Donald Trump is not my President,” a search of his Facebook profile showed. As businessman Trump rose to become the Republican nominee in the 2016 presidential election, his brash style and outspoken views on immigration and other policies led to mass protests, including on the weekend of his inauguration in January.  The charity ballgame between a Republican team and a Democratic team will go ahead as scheduled on Thursday at Nationals Park, home of the Washington Nationals Major League Baseball team. Representative Tim Ryan, who early on Wednesday was practicing for the ballgame with fellow Democrats, told reporters that Washington politicians needed to cool their rhetoric. “We’ve got to get back to ... where things aren’t so personal and we’re so judgmental of each other. It’s got to stop. A member of the U.S. Congress got shot because they didn’t like (his) political views,” Ryan said. Trump, who announced the gunman’s death, called for unity. “We are strongest when we are unified and when we work together for the common good,” he said. In a show of bipartisanship, Republican House Speaker Paul Ryan said on the floor of the House: “An attack on one of us is an attack on all of us.” The House’s top Democrat, Nancy Pelosi, echoed Ryan’s message. The shooting happened shortly after 7 a.m. There were 20 House members and two senators present, and the shooting lasted about 10 minutes, said Barton. Two lawmakers who were at the scene, Representatives Ron DeSantis and Jeff Duncan, indicated there might have been a political motive in the attack. Duncan said that as he left the field, the man who would later open fire approached him in the parking lot. “He asked me who was practicing this morning, Republicans or Democrats, and I said: ‘That’s the Republicans practicing,’” Duncan told reporters. DeSantis gave a similar account. Senator Bernie Sanders, an independent who sought the 2016 Democratic presidential nomination, said he had been told that  Hodgkinson had served as a volunteer with his campaign. “Let me be as clear as I can be: Violence of any kind is unacceptable in our society and I condemn this action in the strongest possible terms,” Sanders said. Ryan, the House speaker, is reviewing rules on how rank-and-file lawmakers can increase their personal security, according to several lawmakers. “Members get threats on a regular basis and have trouble determining which are real,” House Democratic whip Steny Hoyer told reporters. The shooting took place at Eugene Simpson Stadium Park in the Del Ray neighborhood of Alexandria, across the Potomac River from Washington.       Representative Mo Brooks told CNN that during batting practice, he heard a “bam” and then a quick succession of shots and saw the gunman shooting through the holes in a chain link fence. When Scalise was shot, he went down on the infield between first and second base, then dragged himself into the grassy outfield as the incident unfolded, leaving a trail of blood,  Brooks said. Two Capitol police officers who were there to provide security for the lawmakers engaged the gunman with pistols, Brooks said. “But for the Capitol police and the heroism they showed, it could very well have been a large-scale massacre. All we would have had would have been baseball bats versus a rifle. Those aren’t good odds,” Brooks said. Wednesday’s attack was the first shooting of a member of Congress since January 2011, when Democratic Representative Gabby Giffords was seriously wounded in an assassination attempt at a gathering of constituents in Tucson, Arizona. Six people were killed. Giffords resigned from Congress and became an activist for gun restrictions. ',\n",
       " 'Stories of governments removing citizens from their homes and apartments in European nations and replacing them with migrants in need of government subsidized housing is becoming more and more common. The Obama regime set the ball in motion for  fair share housing  or social engineering. Will our legislators be able to stop the insanity of displacing citizens who are receiving housing subsidies from our government in favor of refugees or illegal aliens? Having lived in the same flat for 16 years, a German woman is being forced to move out to make way for refugees, because building a new shelter is too expensive. The 51 year-old nurse, who has helped asylum seekers in the past, was shocked by the news.Bettina Halbey, who lives alone in the small town of Nieheim, received a letter from her landlord and the local municipality at the start of September, Die Welt newspaper reported on Thursday. I was completely shocked and I can t even begin to find the words to describe how the city has treated me,  Halbey told the German publication.  I have had to go through a lot of difficulties recently, and then I get this notice. It was like a kick in the teeth. Halbey will have until May 2016 to find a new place to live, along with her dog and her cat. The three-story building, where she rented a 90 sq/m flat will now be turned into accommodation for refugees, who are seeking to make Germany their new home.The mayor of Nieheim, Rainer Vidal, which has a population of just over 6,000, defended the decision to send the nurse packing, saying converting the building would be  the cheapest option. A new residential unit for 30 refugees in Nieheim would cost  30,000 ($33,600). This solution will cost me nothing,  he told Die Welt.Over half the population of Germany lives in rented accommodation and the country has laws to defend the rights of tenants. Normally, only a private individual can terminate the terms of a contract for personal use. A municipality cannot move into a flat as a legal entity, so the process is legally highly questionable,  Ulrich Ropertz, spokesman of the German Tenants  Federation, told the Telegraph.

However, the two sources who spoke to reporters said that the New Jersey governor was not offered the one position he had coveted and ass kissed for after his own bid for the presidency went down in flames: attorney general.The sources said that Christie just didn t think any of the positions he was offered were a good fit for him. So, at this point, it looks like Christie is going to finish out his second term as governor of New Jersey, which ends in January of 2018.Christie and Trump have been friends for more than a decade. When Christie s own White House dreams went up in smoke, he quickly fell in line behind Trump. Christie was put in charge of Trump s transition team in May and for a while, it looked as if he might be chosen as Trump s running mate.A few weeks ago, shortly after Trump won the election, Christie announced that he would be serving out his final term as New Jersey governor. For some reason, people think I m equivocal about this,  the governor said  on Nov. 29. And I m not. I m completing my term. But Christie then began lobbying to be appointed as chairman of the Republican National Committee, but he was apparently not offered that position either. In a report last week, NJ.com said,  he and Trump decided mutually that he would not assume the job, said the sources, who requested anonymity to discuss the scenario candidly. One source close to Christie said Trump s team is continuing to talk to the New Jersey governor, a longtime Trump friend and adviser, about various other positions in the incoming administration. According to one source, current RNC Chairman Reince Priebus would like to name his own successor.

       " 'BERLIN (Reuters) - International observers documented a range of concerns during November’s U.S. elections, including cyber security risks, disenfranchisement of current and former prisoners, and an opaque campaign finance system, a German newspaper group reported. “The American electoral system is very fragmented and in many places no longer meets international standards,” Michael Link, chief election observer for the 57-member Organization for Security and Cooperation in Europe (OSCE), told the Funke Mediengruppe newspaper chain. A report prepared by a team of OSCE observers who monitored the Nov. 8 presidential and congressional elections cited the need for steps to make the U.S. campaign finance system more transparent and address moves by many U.S. states to ban former and current prisoners from voting, Link said. He said each state had different voting laws and varying usage of new voting technologies.  There were increasing moves across the United States to return to a paper-based voting system after negative experiences with electronic voting machines in recent years, but 15 states used computers that did not allow a manual recount, he said. Link said the U.S. Department of Homeland Security and other agencies had taken steps to ensure the security of electronic voting machines, but many machines in use across the country were old and did not meet international standards. “This is a security risk,” Link said. Link also criticised U.S. President-elect Donald Trump, who will be sworn in on Friday, for “consciously and repeatedly overstepping the bounds of hate speech.” “That he was successful with this sets a dangerous precedent,” Link said. “The international community expects the United States to provide a good example, also in this area.” No further details of the report were immediately available. The OSCE sent its biggest team ever to the United States for the 2016 election amid charges from Trump that the poll could be “rigged” and concerns by civil rights activists that black voters could face undue obstacles.

We remain the only state in the country that does not cover these kids.Gov. Ducey decided it would be too much trouble to overcome the opposition of extremist ideologues in the House, even though we had the Senate votes to win.There would be ZERO COST to the state to extend this coverage. Some of those kids will not be alive next year. This is a complete failure of leadership on the part of the Governor and the legislative majorityLet that sink in: if the Governor gets his way, Arizona will continue to be the only state that does not cover low-income children s healthcare services. Even Kansas, which is on the brink of near total financial collapse, extends this program.The program was cut almost in its entirety in 2011 thanks to Arizona s former governor Jan Brewer. Not only did she cut the program, she imposed enrollment caps on the Medicaid system to ensure that program would almost never return. Those actions caused 14,000 children to lose their healthcare. In total, with the caps put into place, over 300,000 lost their access.Reports released by the Georgetown University Center for Children and Families found these startling facts about Arizona s heartless treatment of children:But don t worry, folks.

       " '(Reuters) - Pennsylvania Governor Tom Wolf on Wednesday signed into law new measures to expand the sale of bottled wine to certain private stores, a move that could generate millions in state revenues through taxes and licensing fees. Pennsylvania is one of just two U.S. states, along with Utah, with full control over its liquor sale system - owning and operating retail and wholesale operations. “This is truly a historic day for Pennsylvania and the most significant step the commonwealth has taken to reform our liquor system in 80 years,” Wolf said in a statement. The new legislation, passed by lawmakers on Tuesday, moves wine sales beyond the state’s publicly run system, allowing supermarkets, convenience stores, restaurants and hotels that already have licenses for carry-out beer to sell up to four bottles of wine to customers. [nL1N18Z1W7] It also expands direct wine shipments by the case; liquor, wine and beer sales at casinos; and hours of operation at state stores, including on Sundays. The move is expected to increase retail wine sales overall and could add more than $150 million to state coffers. The Pennsylvania Liquor Control Board is the largest purchaser of wine and spirits in the United States. The state has an 18 percent liquor tax. ',\n",
       " 'Ever since the horrific act of senseless violence that was perpetuated on LGBT venue Pulse Nightclub in Orlando, Florida, the most hateful preachers imaginable have been coming out of the woodwork to praise the shooter s actions. One of those preachers is Roger Jiminez of Sacramento, California s Verity Baptist Church. He posted a  sermon  that spread like wildfire where he said: As a Christian, we shouldn t be mourning the death of 50 sodomites. Let me go ahead and start right there. As a Christian, we shouldn t be sad or upset. Thankfully, YouTube has removed Jiminez s rant due to violations of its hate speech policy. Jiminez, however, is holding to the beliefs expressed in the sermon, and even goes so far as to suggest that the government should be killing people for being LGBT. Firstly, he says that he does not have one iota of remorse for posting his hateful video: The bible does teach that homosexuality deserves the death penalty. Leviticus 20:13 says that if a man lie with mankind like he does with a woman, both of them have committed an abomination and will surely be put to death. Romans 1 says that they which commit such things are worthy of death. Jiminez went on to add that, if people die who deserve to die, we don t need to be mourning that.  Perhaps the one redeeming quality this horrible excuse for a human being has is that he has no love lost for the shooter either: This gunman there that shot people up, the bible says he deserves to die, he died and we shouldn t be mourning his death, either. That s the whole point I was making, and it s been taken out of context. But then, he goes on to essentially incite violence while saying he s not inciting violence, all the while calling on the government to execute LGBTQ people: I m not calling people to arms. And I m not telling people they should go do this  What I m saying is that if the government followed the laws of God, that s what they would be doing. And if the government did that, I d be fine with that. I would be fine. I would be totally okay with that, if the government did that. That s what they would do, if we lived in a righteous nation. In other words, this Jiminez character is essentially calling for a queer holocaust, right here in America in 2016. This is where the government really should draw the line. Whether Jiminez is calling people to arms or not, this is the sort of hate speech that causes situations like Orlando s tragic massacre. This is literally giving deranged, hateful individuals permission to go out and kill people they deem worthy of death.It s Roger Jiminez that the government needs to be doing something about, not LGBTQ people.Watch the nauseating remarks below, via Raw Story:Featured image via video screen capture',\n",

As thousands of people lie dead in a mast of rubble and debris, you single handedly turn a national tragedy into praise for yourself and your buildings.Imagine if Hillary Clinton, who was Senator of New York at the time, had said something so incredibly offensive, so devoid of sympathy or empathy for New Yorkers.Of course his supporters   Republicans who exploit 9/11 to draw out our fears   will dismiss this as another liberal character assault.

       " ' (This October 18 story has been refiled to fix dateline, amend headline and first paragraph) ANGOOR ADDA, Pakistan (Reuters) - Pakistan is betting that a pair of nine-foot chain-link fences topped with barbed wire will stop incursions by Islamist militants from Afghanistan, which opposes Islamabad s plans for a barrier along the disputed frontier. Pakistan plans to fence up most of the 2,500 km (1,500 mile) frontier despite Kabul s protests that the barrier would divide families and friends along the Pashtun tribal belt straddling the colonial-era Durand Line drawn up by the British in 1893. Pakistan s military estimates that it will need about 56 billion rupees ($532 million) for the project, while there are also plans to build 750 border forts and employ high-tech surveillance systems to prevent militants crossing. In the rolling hills of the Angoor Adda village in South Waziristan, part of Pakistan s restive Federally Administered Tribal Areas (FATA), three rolls of barbed wire are sandwiched in the six-foot gap between the chain-link fences.  (The fence) is a paradigm change. It is an epoch shift in the border control management,  said a Pakistani army officer in command of South Waziristan during a presentation to foreign media on Wednesday.  There will not be an inch of international border (in South Waziristan) which shall not remain under our observation.  Pakistan s military has so far fenced off about 43 km of the frontier, starting with the most violence-prone areas in FATA, and is expected to recruit tens of thousands of new troops to man the border. It is not clear how long it will take to fence the entire boundary.  But Pakistan s plans have also drawn criticism from across the border. Gulab Mangal, governor of the eastern Afghan province of Nangarhar, told Reuters the wall will create  more hatred and resentment  between two neighbors and will do neither country any good.  The fence will definitely create a lot of trouble for the people along the border on both sides but no wall or fence can separate these tribes,  he said.  I urge the tribes to stand against this action.  Pakistan has blamed Pakistani Taliban militants it says are based on Afghan soil for a spate of attacks at home over the past year, urging Kabul to eradicate  sanctuaries  for militants. Afghanistan, in turn, accuses Islamabad of sheltering the leadership of the Afghan Taliban militants who are battling the Western-backed government in Kabul. Both countries deny aiding militants, but relations between the two have soured in recent years. In May, the tension rose when 10 people were killed in two border villages in Baluchistan region. The clashes occurred in so-called  divided villages , where the Durand Line goes through the heart of the community, and where residents are now bracing for the fence to split their villages in two. Pakistan s previous attempts to build a fence failed about a decade ago and many doubt whether its possible to secure such a lengthy border. But Pakistani army officials are undeterred by the scepticism and insist they will finish the job as the country s security rests on this fence.  By the time we are done, inshallah, we will be very sure of one thing: that nobody can cross this place,  said the Pakistani officer in charge of South Waziristan. ',\n",
       " 'But wait wasn t the Muslim Brotherhood s Arab Spring (Sharia Law for all Egyptians) supposed to be a good thing? An Egyptian court sentenced Mohamed Badie, leader of the outlawed Muslim Brotherhood, and 13 other senior members of the group to death for inciting chaos and violence, and gave a life term to a U.S.-Egyptian citizen for ties to the Brotherhood.The men were among thousands of people detained after freely elected Islamist president Mohamed Mursi was toppled in 2013 by the military under Abdel Fattah al-Sisi, who is now president.Sisi describes the Brotherhood as a major security threat. The group says it is committed to peaceful activism and had nothing to do with Islamist militant violence in Egypt since Mursi s fall following mass protests against his rule.Egypt s mass trials of Brotherhood members and people accused of links to the group, as well as its tough crackdown on Islamist and liberal opposition alike, have drawn international criticism of its judicial system and human rights record.The sentences, pronounced at a televised court session on Saturday, can be appealed before Egypt s highest civilian court in a process that could take years to reach a final verdict.U.S.-Egyptian citizen Mohamed Soltan was sentenced to life in jail for supporting the veteran Islamist movement and transmitting false news. He is the son of Brotherhood preacher Salah Soltan, who was among those sentenced to death.Mohamed Abdel-Mawgod, one of the defense lawyers, condemned the verdicts.  The court did not differentiate between the defendants and put them all in the same basket,  he told reporters at the courthouse. None of the defendants were present during the hearing.Badie is the Brotherhood s General Guide and has already been sentenced to several death and life sentences. His deputy Khairat El-Shater was given a life sentence on Saturday. OPERATIONS ROOM  TRIALRights groups say Egypt, where a popular uprising toppled veteran autocrat Hosni Mubarak in 2011 and started years of political turmoil, is now cracking down on all dissent. Sisi says stability is needed to revive the shattered economy.Rights advocates have criticized a U.S. decision to end a freeze on military aid to Cairo, saying Washington is putting human rights on the backburner. The United States has said the decision to end the freeze was in the interest of national security.Mohamed Soltan, 27, arrested in August 2013, had been on hunger strike while in prison. He deserves the punishment because of the money and instructions from the Brotherhood which were found with him, and for spreading chaos and horror in society,  presiding Judge Mohamed Nagi Shehata told reporters.Sara Mohamed, a relative of the Soltan family, said they would appeal the verdict.  It was a farce trial of the first class None of the defendants attended the session,  she told Reuters by phone.A website calling for Mohamed Soltan s release says he was not a member of the Brotherhood, describing him as a U.S.-educated peace activist who was involved in youth events and charities. The website shows pictures of him lying emaciated on a stretcher while in detention.Saturday s case was known in local media as  The Rabaa Operations Room  trial. This is in reference to a sit-in at Rabaa square in 2013 in which hundreds of people protesting at the overthrow of Mursi were killed when security forces tried to clear the area by force.Cairo has defended its actions, saying it had given protesters the opportunity to leave peacefully and that armed elements within the Brotherhood initiated the violence.Saturday s session sentenced 51 people. Those who were not sentenced to death were given a life sentence. The long list of charges included leading and funding an outlawed group, overturning the constitution and planning to spread chaos, a court source said.Via: Reuters',\n",
       " 'White privilege is about the fact that for Americans life is very different depending on skin color. The differences can be seen through all aspects of life, but the most stark is the fact that white people are much, much more likely to die of old age than are black people. In fact, data guru Nate Silver says that to be black in America is just about as bad as living in war torn Rwanda.Gun arguments aside if you re white in America, you re pretty damned safe. Your chance of being murdered in any given year is 2.5 out of 10,000. That s about equal to Finland, Israel and Chile. To be black, though, is very different. Your odds of being murdered about about eight times higher, or 19.4 out of every 10,000. That compares to Myanmar, Rwanda, Mexico, Brazil and Nigeria.Silver rarely expresses his political opinions (other than statistical predictions) but he did editorialize a bit on police brutality: So I m an editor now as well as a writer so we think when a story occurs is this a quote unquote  random act of violence  or is this representative of some broader trend and I think these stories about police brutality, it s uncovering things that have been going on for a long time and that are very common experiences Now that we do have video cameras everywhere it s not a coincidence that all of a sudden now that we have means to record these things all of a sudden these things crop up all the time.

To be black on the other hand, means always being on guard and always on your best behavior. Don t loiter, but don t walk (or drive) fast. Don t put your hands in your pockets. Don t make eye contact with police. Don t not look at police when you re being spoken to. The list could go on. The rules for being black are simply different than the rules for being white.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump has said the armed standoff at a national wildlife refuge in Oregon had gone on “too long,” and that once people are allowed to take over federal property, “you don’t have a government anymore.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 But last week, after he made those comments, the head of a veterans’ group formed by his campaign traveled to Oregon to meet with protesters whom he described as a “peaceful” and “constitutionally just” movement. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Although Jerry DeLemus, a 61-year-old retired Marine, said he made the visit on his own rather than as a representative of Trump’s campaign, he is the only member of a presidential campaign to have openly visited the occupation of the Malheur Wildlife Refuge since it began on Jan. 2. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 His presence at the Oregon standoff highlights the array of extreme views in Trump’s support base, as the billionaire real-estate mogul taps a vein of grassroots supporters who are deeply upset with current federal leadership in his quest to lead the Republican Party in this year’s presidential election. In an interview on Tuesday, DeLemus told Reuters that while he was skeptical of the occupation at first, he now thinks the group is enjoying “great success” in resisting the “thug-like, terroristic” actions of the federal government by claiming the land for local citizens. Trump’s campaign has received support from several other sources who hold more extreme views than him, including white supremacist groups that recently launched a pro-Trump automated telephone campaign in Iowa and former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke, whose endorsement Trump rejected in August. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Unlike those supporters, however, DeLemus is a formal member of Trump’s campaign and says he plans to help inform the candidate about the true nature of the standoff in Oregon in an effort to convince Trump to support their cause. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 The armed protesters garrisoned at the wildlife refuge are led by Ammon Bundy, a rancher from Nevada. The occupation, which began as a protest against the extended prison sentences of local ranchers who set fire to federal land, is now focused on reclaiming the federal land in the county for local citizens. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0“It’s my intention to ensure that he has the whole story,” DeLemus said of Trump. “I think it’ll really arouse him, and once he understands, I wouldn’t be surprised to see him heading out West.” The Trump campaign did not respond to requests for comment.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Dan Shea, a professor of government at Maine’s Colby College who has studied the polarization of American voters, says the Oregon standoff would likely have strong appeal to some Trump supporters.  “What Trump supporters want is dramatic action, and for some, what’s happening in Oregon is an example of that.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 DeLemus has a history of expressing views and taking actions that are more extreme than those of Trump, who has been criticized by Democrats and Republicans alike for what some see as a stream of shocking, offensive and radical remarks.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0In 2014, DeLemus spent about a month in Nevada leading a makeshift militia in a standoff with the Bureau of Land Management on behalf of rancher Cliven Bundy, whose sons are leading the Oregon occupation.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Last year, DeLemus also made headlines for planning an art contest for people to draw the Prophet Mohammad in New Hampshire, though he called it off for public safety reasons. Depictions of the prophet of Islam are considered offensive by many Muslims. ',\n",

Last night I was on the phone with them for several hours, was able to have prayer with them, and they have said they would come out today,  he said in the Wednesday night post.  I am on my way there and hope to be there by 7:00 AM their time. Please keep them, law enforcement officials, and all involved in your prayers, that everyone will be safe. In the final moments leading up to the planned surrender, discussions between the holdouts and Nevada lawmaker Michele Fiore, a sympathizer who flew to Oregon, were being livestreamed in an online broadcast.LIVE FEED:SLOW MOTION VIDEO Of protester and patriot, Lavoy Finicum shooting death by FBI:Oregon Protester s Interview Voicing Concerns The Day Before He Was Killed WATCH VIDEO HERE18:22 Cliven Bundy charged with assault, conspiracySome breaking news from outside of the refuge: The Associated Press is reporting that Cliven Bundy has been charged with assault and conspiracy for his 2014 standoff with the federal government at his Nevada ranch.The 69-year-old rancher has for years refused to pay grazing fees to the government to have his cattle use public lands. The dispute reached a head when federal officials attempted to seize his cattle and armed anti-government protesters came to his aid.He still owes the government more than $1m.Cliven Bundy was arrested late Wednesday night in Portland. Earlier in the evening, he told the Guardian he was on his way to Oregon to support the occupiers. He is currently in jail in Portland.13:17 David Fry is telling the more than 25,000 listeners on the live YouTube stream that he fears going to prison. They need to address my grievances. They need to promise me absolute protection,  Fry said.  Even if I go to prison, they should promise me absolute protection. He also said he worried he would be attacked by other prisoners.Gavin Seim, the live-streamer, told him not to be afraid:  Don t be intimidated by a jail or prison cell.  He said the people in jail are like him   others who have been  abused by the government .Fry continued:  I can t come out guys. I can t do it. 12:50 David Fry said on the live-stream that Jeff Banta, one of the four holdouts, is now leaving the occupation and surrendering.Fry, however, is now shouting demands at the FBI:  Unless my grievances are heard, I will not come out! Gavin Seim, the live-streamer, tried to keep him calm:  Go and walk out there like the others   We ve got the world watching. They haven t even promised anything, really. I didn t agree to any of this, really. I m kind of worried that they are just going to ignore us,  Fry said.Seim responded:  It s in God s hands. 12:41 Occupiers walking outSean Anderson has just said that FBI officials have told them to exit the refuge one at a time. Michele Fiore is no longer on the live-feed. You coming out, Sean?  Gavin Seim asked Coming out!  Sean shouted on the video.  They re walking toward us. It looks like they ve got guns pointed at us,  David Fry said, adding that Jeff Banta is next to him. They are basically patting her down and I think they are going to apprehend her there,  Fry said of Sandy Anderson.  Now, Sean is standing there holding the American flag in his hand. 12:16 Latest summaryNevada assemblywoman Michele Fiore and Franklin Graham, a high-profile reverend, are on their way to the Malheur national wildlife refuge headquarters in rural Harney County with FBI officials. The plan is to escort the occupation holdouts out.The four holdouts are: Sandy Anderson, 48, Sean Anderson, 47, Jeff Banta, 46, and David Fry, 27.The four were indicted by a federal grand jury last week on conspiracy charges and could face six years in prison.Nevada rancher Cliven Bundy was arrested in Portland last night and will appear in court at 1.30pm today.From evening of February 10:00:09: Occupiers say they will meet FBI at checkpoint at 8amThe tone of the occupiers is becoming more conciliatory.Sean Anderson tells Seim that the FBI has offered to meet them at a checkpoint at 8am (PST) on Thursday.He says the four of them have agreed to leave their weapons in their vehicles before approaching the checkpoint.Both Andersons say they want the media to be present at the checkpoint. The world s going to be watching,  says Seim.  They re not just going to haul you away into the darkness. 04:20The feed of the live phone call is at turns disturbing and downright surreal. There was just a moment of sheer panic when Sean Anderson announced he was going to light an outdoor heater. I am going to light a propane heater cos we are standing out here freezing cold,  he said. Don t do that, don t do that,  replied Congresswoman Fiore.There appeared to be a frantic attempt to communicate with the FBI that the occupiers were on the cusp of lighting their heater, so they didn t misunderstand what was happening.Amid discussions about whether there were flammable materials in the area, and attempts to implore Anderson not to light the heater, he replied:  I am going to go ahead and light this so my wife can be warm. If they shoot them that s on their fucking ass. He lit the heater. Lights are seen from the Narrows roadblock near Burns, Oregon, as FBI agents surrounded the remaining four occupiers at the Malheur national wildlife refuge.

In order to stay alive, I have to submit and be a slave,  Sean Anderson shouts. He compares himself to Braveheart. I m not asking you to give up,  Fiore tells him.22:50 Associated Press has further background information on two of the occupiers, husband and wife Sean and Sandy Anderson:The husband and wife moved from the town of Janesville, Wisconsin, within the last several years to Riggins, Idaho, where Sean, 47, opened a store for hunting, tactical and survival gear. Sandy, 48, worked at a gas station.Idaho County, where they live, and Harney County, 290 miles away where the refuge is located, are similar in many ways. Both have large portions of land managed by federal agencies and populations chafing at restrictions put on that land.Idaho county sheriff Doug Giddings said the Andersons are good residents, though he didn t know as much about Sean as he did about Sandy. She s a good person, she s just upset with the government,  he told Oregon Public Broadcasting.Sean Anderson is facing misdemeanor charges in Wisconsin for resisting an officer, possession of drug paraphernalia and possession of THC, the intoxicating chemical in marijuana.He also has pleaded guilty to a series of misdemeanors in recent years: domestic abuse in December 2010, disorderly conduct in 2008, criminal trespass in a dwelling in 2002, and disorderly conduct in 1999.A friend of the couple, Lindsey Dipo, told the Lewiston Tribune newspaper that the couple recorded their will on Dipo s cellphone before departing for Oregon.22:46 The occupiers   and Fiore on the other end of the phone line   break off frequently to pray.Sandy Anderson is angered because she says the FBI negotiators interrupted one prayer session.Fiore says this is good   it shows the FBI is listening to the broadcast and they know what is happening.22:43 If they won t give us one more day   we re just going to stay here and fucking die,  Sean Anderson says. 22:39 Cliven Bundy on his way to the refugeCliven Bundy has confirmed in a phone interview with the Guardian just now that he is on his way to the refuge. I hope I save some lives, for one thing,  he said.The elder Bundy said he decided to go to Harney County after he saw the FBI was closing in on the occupiers:I guess if they wanted to murder somebody tonight, that d be a good way to do it.I don t know whether I ll be a negotiator or maybe a demander. I think we oughta take this country back and I think it s time the feds get out of there.Bundy said he has not heard from law enforcement:I m not really talking to the FBI. As far as I m concerned, they have no jurisdiction or authority there.Bundy declined to say if anyone else was with him or how long it would take him to get there.22:35 Sean Anderson says he wants assurances that the four occupiers won t face prosecution. They can drop charges, they do it all the time   for people who are way worse than we are,  he told Fiore.The occupiers are also telling the assemblywoman that Franklin Graham, a reverend from the Billy Graham Evangelistic Association, is in discussions with them. The occupiers said the FBI may consider letting them walk out at 7am Thursday morning with Graham.But Sean Anderson said he wasn t confident they would get out alive:  How can we trust what they are saying? 22:32Sean Anderson, one of the occupiers, has just announced what he calls their  concession    that the four of them will leave the refuge in daylight on Thursday if they are allowed to be accompanied by Congresswoman Fiore and Christian evangelist Franklin Graham.He says the FBI must now offer its own concession in return.22:30According to a Facebook page associated with the militia, Cliven Bundy   father of Ammon Bundy and himself involved in an earlier standoff with officials   is on his way to the site of the siege.However, the FBI has reportedly told the four occupiers that nobody will be able to enter the property.22:26 Helicopters heard over the refugePaul Lewis Paul Lewis The live broadcast just captured the moment the occupiers heard helicopters above the refuge. The black hawks are here and they re going to kill us,  said one voice, which appeared to be David Fry, the most agitated of the occupiers.He added moments later:  If they fire first, my weapon is in reach and I m going to take them with me. Gavin Seim, the rightwing activist who is running the Youtube broadcast, led a group prayer for those inside, and assured them that leader Ammon Bundy, who in prison, has been taken out of solitary confinement.Assemblywoman Michele Fiore   who is also on the line, acting as a mediator   is also encouraging the remaining occupiers to remain calm.  I need you to stay alive. The only way we re going to be able to write your story and write your book is if you stay alive. The occupiers appear to have a separate line to the FBI, and are relaying that they ve been told no one will be allowed on to the refuge until they leave. They want us to leave. They said the time for concessions has passed,  Sandy Anderson said.The details are sketchy, and the audio in parts inaudible, but it appears that one proposal is for a local figure, possibly a reverend, to join the occupiers and lead them off the site.David Fry, the 27-year-old occupier from Ohio, has become increasingly agitated on the live stream, shouting at Fiore and his fellow protesters.Fry made headlines when he posted video of himself using government computers to create a website for the occupation.According to a recent profile of Fry by Oregon Public Broadcasting (OPB), his antics led many in the militia to grow frustrated with him, with some wanting him to leave.Fry had previously communicated with militia spokesman LaVoy Finicum online, and Finicum had reportedly encouraged the young occupier to stay.Fry s family told the radio station that he has frequently had problems with authorities.  He s had his problems, some of which he s brought on himself,  his grandfather, William Fry, told OPB. He gets pulled over for busted taillights, and instead of just rolling down his window and handing over his insurance, he screams at the officer,  What the [expletive] do you want?  And right there, a regular thing turns into him in handcuffs.  Fry also often writes about conspiracy theories online.Via: The GuardianThe occupation at Malheur started on 2 January in response to the conviction of two local ranchers on arson charges. Our explainer has more on the background to the 40-day standoff:One protester has been shot dead and eight others were arrested on Tuesday after a confrontation between police and an armed group that has taken over a federal wildlife reserve in Oregon.What were the circumstances of the shooting? The FBI said shots were fired after officers stopped a car carrying Ammon Bundy, the leader of the protests, and five others near the Malheur National Wildlife Refuge. Activists said rancher Robert  LaVoy  Finicum was killed, and one person wounded. Finicum, 55, had been one of the main spokesmen for the occupation, appearing at daily news conferences, posting regular dispatches on his YouTube page and organising some of the most high-profile actions protesting against the federal government s regulation of public lands. Bundy and four other senior members were taken into custody following the confrontation along Highway 395 near the reserve in north-east Oregon at 4.25pm local time, the FBI said. Two others were arrested later, including Peter Santilli, a journalist who livestreamed events at the refuge.Is the standoff over? No. FBI agents have set up a perimeter around the wildlife refuge, where an unknown number of people are still holding out. One of the remaining occupiers, Jason Patrick, told Reuters by phone that they would stay until the  redress of grievances . He said:  I ve heard  peaceful resolution  for weeks now and now there s a cowboy who is my friend who is dead   so prepare for the peaceful resolution. How long has the occupation been going on, and why are they there? The takeover at Malheur started on 2 January after a peaceful protest in nearby Burns, Oregon, over the conviction of two local ranchers on arson charges. Dwight Hammond, 73, and his son Steven Hammond, 46, said they lit fires on federal land in 2001 and 2006 to reduce the growth of invasive plants and protect their property from wildfires. The two were convicted three years ago. But in October a federal judge ruled their terms were too short and ordered them back to prison for about four years each. Among the demands by the group is for the Hammonds to be released. But the militia have more deep-seated grievances over land under federal government control.',\n",
       " 'Dr. Gina Loudon is hands down one of our favorite conservative writers. She nails it with this piece about the truth behind the lies of the California drought I found it supremely ironic this week that two of the big stories were about a man-made lack of water in California, and a man lost in a vast sea off of Florida.Gov. Jerry  Moonbeam  Brown announced the dire circumstances, not from the Capitol in Sacramento, but from the dramatic backdrop of a mountaintop. His narrative held that there should be five feet of  snow pack,  but alas, there was none. Brown, and the radical Marxists, couched as  environmentalists  he represents, have convinced most Americans to hold two radically opposing views simultaneously. Ostensibly, California is in danger of being flooded by rising sea levels caused by global warming and melting polar ice caps, and it is also utterly out of water.There is no shortage of water. This is an environmentalist-created drought that is costing billions.I waver between utter disgust and admiration when I watch how the leftists sell these things, always with straight faces. Every major news outlet in America and many around the world swallowed the narrative like fish on a baited hook. They tell us there is no water, no snow to provide water for the summer, and the farmers are taking too much so people must suffer. There is an all-out war on grass, and no one is safe. Sorry, Shaggy, your  grass  is to blame as well.There is hand wringing in every club house as the boards are told they are coming for the rough grass, your fairways and greens are safe, for now. Evil rich guys in colorful knickers and almond farmers in overalls are the scourge of California. Off with their heads! Oh, and you can forget about the luxury of children playing on the lawn. If you want that, you breeders should move to flyover land! Don t you dare sneak and water the backyard after dark; Brown makes it easy for your neighbors to snitch on you. I m not making this up. They really have a state hotline for that.Those of us who pay attention know well the proverb,  Where there is no vision, the people perish.  The people who built California into the greatest agricultural producer in America gave us dams, canals, reservoirs and all kinds of conveyance of water. They harnessed the rivers that reach from the Pacific Northwest down well into Northern California and even draw water to the Golden State from the Colorado River. That was then. Nothing has changed since then, except political power.For the last several decades, the radical fringe has taken full control of California, and it hates people. Dennis Prager observed that statists love humanity but hate humans. Watch how they latch onto dreams of egalitarian states but begin the execution of their plans by marginalizing, isolating and then executing anyone who disagrees with them. They dine in the finest restaurants in San Francisco, the likes of Brown, Pelosi, Boxer and Feinstein, planning lawsuits to cut the flow of water to the farms of Central California and the people in Southern California, caring not a wit that 40,000 agricultural workers, mostly Hispanic, are unemployed.Just this week, in the middle of a human crisis, federal fish agents ordered the release of billions of gallons of water purportedly to save six fish. You read that right. Not to save six species of fish, but literally, six fish. Apparently, these special six stood their, err ground, and when 29 of their compadres rode the 10 billion gallon man-made wave to the ocean in March, they refused to go with the flow (sorry).You can t make this stuff up. But when you do, people actually believe it.So Obama administration agents want a second toilet flush to give these hard-headed steelheads a second nudge. The idea that nature itself may be holding the fish where they are is of no concern to statists who love telling both man and beast what they think is good for them. Sadly, this latest mind-boggling atrocity is getting very little media coverage. I found excellent coverage in the Manteca Bulletin. Why hasn t the Los Angeles Times reported on this?The current shortage is based primarily on the release of billions of gallons daily into the San Francisco Bay to sustain the bait fish known as the Delta smelt. This is a simple distribution issue; there is plenty of water.Prior to the statists taking over California, massive pumps were diverting water from rivers into the canal system (built before Brown and his ilk took control of the state). They have all but turned these pumps off to protect the fish from their Darwinian demise, and billions upon billions of gallons of fresh water is continuously dumped into the ocean.For the people-hating San Francisco cabal, cutting off water from the people is the real goal. They want fewer people to begin with, but the ultimate goal is control. Few environmentalists admit it publicly, but they want zero farming in the central valley, preferring to  allow  land to return to its prehistoric state. The cabal wants to control water so they can control people. Brown is just the messenger today. He is telling America that water access is a privilege, he has the power to pick winners and losers, and we have to just take it.If Brown decides tomorrow that he wants to withhold water from almond farmers, Americans will just have to accept it. Have you ever wondered why any business owner would give campaign donations to Marxist, business-hating politicians? Now you know why. They must give to buy protection. Business owners do not donate to Brown, Pelosi or Harry Reid because those politicians are good for business; they give to be sure they are not the next targets.The problem with all of this is that water is a limitless natural resource. Just ask the sailor who faced drowning daily or the people in the Midwest who were deluged this week. It is one thing to argue for conservation of animals, or even trees, or  green space,  but water? Water is a limitless natural resource. Not even the most self-important leftist believes he could make water go away, no matter how hard he tried. How did they convince us to accept this lie?They got us to buy the lie that water is scarce by telling it often enough and pounding it into generations of schoolchildren. Using federal law and acts of Congress, they forced people from water-soaked regions to accept low flush or what some call  two flush  toilets the same as desert-dwelling Californians. And we fell for it. At least the Democrats among us fell for it.Thus it is that Brown got to have his cake and eat it, too. He told Californians, and really all Americans and the world, that lack of water was not his fault for lacking the vision to feed the distribution system created by the real men who built California. He repeats that it is not the fault of the Marxists  Endangered Species Act that prefers hard-headed fish over people. The lack of water is the result of the lack of  snow pack,  which is the result of  climate change,  which is the result of greedy people being well, people. The Delta smelt and steelhead trout must live and we mere humans should all just die.Meanwhile, Jerry Brown is committed to spending $100 billion for trains, but he has made zero commitment to allowing water to flow to people instead of fish, and zero commitment to finding funding for his  twin tunnels  alternate solution. And why would he? We are cutting back our water use, ratting on our neighbors and accepting higher produce prices across America. The Marxists in San Francisco are toasting total victory. The farmers and country club board members are suing for peace. Lord help usVia: WND',\n",

       " 'BERLIN (Reuters) - Describing Brexit as  nonsense , German Finance Minister Wolfgang Schaeuble warned on Monday against allowing Europe to divide further along east-west lines, saying this would be a  catastrophe . Speaking at his 75th birthday party in the southwestern town of Offenburg, Schaeuble paused after mentioning Britain in the context of Europe. Laughter broke out among the guests and, in an aside, he said Britons were probably unhappy now with their vote last year to leave the EU.  If we were now to get new divisions between east and west after the British   it was nonsense to take such a decision and they are probably no longer happy with it   that would be a catastrophe,  he said.  We must be clear: we will only have a good future, history shows this, if we hold Europe together, and that means all of Europe,  he added. Schaeuble appeared to be referring to a deepening divide between eastern countries like Poland and Hungary and their EU partners to the west over democratic values, acceptance of refugees and further European integration. French President Emmanuel Macron has been especially critical of governments in Warsaw and Budapest, which the EU says are distancing themselves from core European values like free speech and rule of law. Germany, in part because of its history with Poland, has been less openly critical of its eastern neighbors, but it has tacitly supported Macron and steps by the EU to ratchet up pressure on governments in the east. Many Poles, especially rightwing supporters of the ruling Law and Justice party, are animated by a hatred of Germans dating to World War Two, though relations have warmed up since the end of communism when Germany backed Polish EU membership. Last week, European Commission chief Jean-Claude Juncker stressed his wish to heal divisions between eastern and western states. Juncker also attended Schaeuble s party on Monday and praised him for working to unify the EU.  Schaeuble said those EU states that want to press ahead with closer integration must do so.  But we must also be careful that not only the big states decide. I learned that from Kohl,  he said with reference to late Chancellor Helmut Kohl, with whom he worked on the reunification of Germany.

       " 'WASHINGTON   President Trump said on Thursday that his administration was answering  a call to action  by rolling back regulations on environmental protections, health care, financial services and other industries as he made a push to showcase his accomplishments near the end of his first year in office.The remarks highlighted an area where Mr. Trump has perhaps done more to change the policies of his predecessor than any other, with regulatory shifts that have affected wide sections of the economy. We are just getting started,  Mr. Trump said, speaking from the Roosevelt Room of the White House. He described progress so far as the  most far-reaching regulatory reform  in United States history, a claim he did not back up.  In 1960, there were approximately 20,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations. Today there are over 185,000 pages, as seen in the Roosevelt Room. Today, we CUT THE RED TAPE!

Trump (@realdonaldtrump) on Dec 14, 2017 at 12:39pm PSTEchoing his days as a real estate developer with the flair of a groundbreaking, Mr. Trump used an oversized pair of scissors to cut a ribbon his staff had set up in front of two piles of paper, representing government regulations in 1960 (20,000 pages, he said), and today   a pile that was about six feet tall (said to be 185,000 pages).His efforts   his staff said that the rules already rolled back had saved $8.1 billion in regulatory costs over their lifetime, or a total of an estimated $570 million a year   have brought cheers from the business community, most notably from companies that will benefit from the rollbacks.Several economic indicators   and comments from companies large and small   suggest that a shift in federal regulatory policy is building business confidence and accelerating economic growth, developments Mr. Trump certainly took credit for on Thursday.A survey of chief executives released this month by the Business Roundtable found that, for the first time in six years, executives did not cite regulation as the top cost pressure facing their companies.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Friday dismissed reports that the White House is weighing a plan under which he would be replaced by CIA Director Mike Pompeo as “laughable.” Media reports on Thursday, first published by the New York Times, cited U.S. officials as saying that Trump has a plan to replace his embattled secretary of state with Pompeo, a former U.S. congressman who now heads the Central Intelligence Agency. Asked if some at the White House wanted him to resign, Tillerson told reporters: “It’s laughable ... laughable.”  His comments came as he posed for pictures with Libyan Prime Minister Fayez Seraj of the U.N.-backed government in Tripoli. Tillerson’s relationship with Trump has been strained by the top U.S. diplomat’s softer line on North Korea and other policy differences, as well as by reports in October that he had called the president a “moron.” Tillerson has not directly addressed whether he made the comment, though his spokeswoman denied it. Asked on Thursday whether he wanted Tillerson to remain in his job, Trump sidestepped the question, telling reporters at the White House: “He’s here. Rex is here.” State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said on Thursday White House Chief of Staff John Kelly had told Tillerson’s chief of staff the reports on Tillerson being replaced were not true.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. President-elect Donald Trump said on Thursday night he would nominate retired Marine Corps General James Mattis, known as “Mad Dog” and renowned for his tough talk and battlefield experience in Iraq and Afghanistan, to lead the Pentagon. “We are going to appoint ‘Mad Dog’ Mattis as our secretary of defense,” Trump told a rally in Cincinnati. He said the formal announcement would be made on Monday. The choice of a seasoned military strategist would be another indication that Trump, a Republican, intends to steer U.S. foreign policy away from Democratic President Barack Obama’s increased reliance on U.S. allies to fight Islamist militants and to help deter Russian and Chinese aggression in Europe and Asia. Mattis is a revered figure in the Marine Corps and known for his distrust of Iran. The Washington Post and CNN reported earlier that Trump had chosen Mattis, but Trump spokesman Jason Miller said earlier on Twitter that “no decision has been made yet with regard to Secretary of Defense.” While the nomination of the 66-year-old Mattis would likely be popular among U.S. forces, it would have to clear a bureaucratic hurdle.   Because he retired only in 2013, Mattis would need the U.S. Congress to waive a requirement that a defense secretary be a civilian for at least seven years before taking the top job at the Pentagon. His impressive combat record, however, may deter some Senate Democrats from trying to block his nomination. Trump has described Mattis as “a true general’s general.”  The New York real estate magnate famously asserted last year: “I know more about ISIS than the generals do.” Mattis, whose past assignments include leading Central Command, which oversees U.S. military operations in the Middle East and South Asia, is known for his colorful expressions that unashamedly embrace the job of the U.S. armed forces: fighting wars. In one famous line in 2003 attributed to Mattis, the general told Marines in Iraq: “Be polite, be professional, but have a plan to kill everybody you meet.” In a 2016 question-and-answer session, Mattis appeared to be moved by a Marine’s question about how far out he could inflict casualties with his knife hand, known as a “kill-casualty radius.” “Once you get to be a high-ranking officer, the kill-casualty radius is whatever your Marines make it, and by the time I got up to the senior ranks it was hundreds of miles,” he said in a video for the Marine Corps. Still, such tough talk has gotten him in hot water. He was once rebuked for saying in 2005 that “it’s fun to shoot some people.”  His talk, however, belies a more thoughtful side. Mattis once said the most important 6 inches in a combat zone was “between your ears.” Now a fellow at Stanford University’s Hoover Institution, Mattis is also a scholar who was praised by then-U.S. Defense Secretary Robert Gates in 2010 as one of the country’s great strategic thinkers.  Mattis reads avidly, frequently quotes history and is proud that he grew up with a large library and no television.  After meeting Mattis on Nov. 19, Trump described him as a strong, dignified man who persuasively argued against waterboarding, an interrogation tactic that involves pouring water over someone’s face to simulate drowning.  Trump had promised during the campaign he would not only revive use of waterboarding, which is widely regarded as torture and was banned under President Barack Obama, but bring back “a hell of a lot worse” if elected.  “(Mattis) said: ‘I’ve always found, give me a pack of cigarettes and a couple of beers and I do better with that than I do with torture.’ And I was very impressed by that answer,” Trump told The New York Times. The Senate Armed Services Committee will consider Mattis’ nomination. In a statement on Thursday night, its chairman, Republican John McCain, called him “one of the finest military officers of his generation and an extraordinary leader.”  Mattis would be the first former U.S. general to become defense secretary since George C. Marshall took the job in 1950. The decision adds to Trump’s national security team another Pentagon veteran who served during the Obama administration but often had a testy relationship with it. Officials who knew him before he retired in 2013 said Mattis clashed with top administration officials when he headed Central Command over his desire to better prepare for potential threats from Iran and to win more resources for Afghanistan. Trump has given the job of national security adviser to Michael Flynn, a retired three-star Army general who was pushed out of the top job at the Defense Intelligence Agency in 2014 by Obama’s administration.  Flynn was fiercely critical of Obama during the 2016 campaign, adopting much of Trump’s rhetoric. Along with Flynn and Trump’s choice for CIA director, U.S. Representative Mike Pompeo, Mattis has been critical of the deal to curb Iran’s suspected nuclear weapons program, saying the threat from Tehran should outrank more immediate concerns about Islamic State or al Qaeda. “The Iranian regime, in my mind, is the single most enduring threat to stability and peace in the Middle East,” Mattis said. Speaking about the Iranian nuclear deal, Mattis said: “Hoping that Iran is on the cusp of becoming a responsible, modern nation is a bridge too far.” If Mattis wins Senate confirmation, he will work side by side with another Marine - General Joseph Dunford, who is chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff.  Having two Marine generals in those top jobs would be highly unusual for a service that prides itself on being the most elite U.S. fighting force. It would also raise questions about how Mattis and Dunford might divide up tasks.  Both Dunford and Mattis share battlefield experience, including in Iraq. In 2003, Mattis led the 1st Marine Division during the U.S.-led invasion of Iraq. He has said one of the toughest things he had to do was oversee the retreat of his forces from the city of Falluja in 2004, something he feared would hurt morale, but did not. “We just don’t take refuge in self-pity or any of that kind of stuff. And so as a result, the Marine Corps remains a very feared organization in this world. As it should be,” he said. ',\n",

       " 'RAMALLAH/WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Palestinian officials expressed surprise on Saturday at a U.S. decision to close the Palestine Liberation Organization office in Washington unless the group enters peace negotiations with Israel, and said they would not surrender to blackmail. A U.S. State Department official said that under legislation passed by Congress, Secretary of State Rex Tillerson could not renew a certification that expired this month for the PLO office,  given certain statements made by the Palestinian leaders about the International Criminal Court.  The law says the PLO, the main Palestinian umbrella political body, cannot operate a Washington office if it urges the ICC to prosecute Israelis for alleged crimes against Palestinians. In an address to the United Nations General Assembly in September, Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas said the Palestinian Authority called on the ICC  to open an investigation and to prosecute Israeli officials for their involvement in settlement activities and aggressions against our people.  The State Department official added that restrictions on the PLO in the United States, including the operation of its Washington office, could be waived after 90 days if U.S. President Donald Trump  determines the Palestinians have entered into direct, meaningful negotiations with Israel.   We are hopeful that this closure will be short-lived,  said the official, who spoke on condition of anonymity. According to the official Palestinian news agency WAFA, the Palestinian presidency expressed surprise at the U.S. move, which was first reported by the Associated Press. WAFA quoted Palestinian Foreign Minister Riyad Al-Maliki as saying that Palestinian leaders would not give in to blackmail or pressure regarding the operation of the PLO office or negotiations on an Israeli-Palestinian peace agreement. The agency quoted a spokesman for Abbas, Nabil Abu Rdainah, expressing surprise, given that meetings between Abbas and Trump had been  characterized by full understanding of the steps needed to create a climate for resumption of the peace process.      A Palestinian official who spoke on condition of anonymity told Reuters the State Department had informed the Palestinians of the decision on Wednesday.  It was not immediately clear what effect the State Department s move might have on the Trump administration s efforts to revive peace talks between Israel and the Palestinians, which are led by Jared Kushner, the U.S. president s son-in-law and senior adviser.    Abbas  spokesman called the U.S. move an unprecedented step in U.S.-Palestinian relations that would have serious consequences for the peace process and U.S.-Arab relations, according to WAFA. Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu said in a statement on Saturday:  This is a matter of U.S. law. We respect the decision and look forward to continuing to work with the U.S. to advance peace and security in the region.  The State Department official said the U.S. move did not amount to cutting off relations with the PLO or signal an intention to stop working with the Palestinian Authority.  We remain focused on a comprehensive peace agreement between the Israelis and the Palestinians that will resolve core issues between the parties,  the official said. ',\n",
       " 'TEGUCIGALPA (Reuters) - At least one protester died, over 20 people were injured and more than 100 others were arrested for looting in Honduras after a delayed and disputed presidential vote count sparked unrest amid opposition accusations of electoral fraud. Honduras was due to publish the final result of last Sunday s presidential election at 9 p.m. local time (0300 GMT) on Friday, the electoral tribunal said, but opposition complaints about the count appeared set to impede that.  Election results initially favored opposition candidate and TV star Salvador Nasralla by five points with more than half the votes counted. They then swung in favor of U.S.-backed center-right President Juan Orlando Hernandez after the count came to a halt on Monday and resumed over a day later, sparking protests. The tribunal has said it will hand-count some 1,031 outstanding ballot boxes with irregularities - or nearly 6 percent of the total - after the count halted with Hernandez ahead by less than 50,000 votes, or about 1.5 percentage points. However, Nasralla s center-left alliance has called for votes to be recounted in three of Honduras  18 departments, or regions, and refused to recognize the tribunal s special count until its demands for a wider review were met.  If Juan Orlando wins, we re ready to accept that, but we know that wasn t the case, we know that Salvador won and that s why they re refusing the transparency demands,  said Marlon Ochoa, campaign manager of Nasralla s alliance. International concern has grown about the electoral crisis in the poor Central American country, which struggles with violent drug gangs and one of the world s highest murder rates. Police sources said at least one man had been shot and killed at a protest in the city of La Ceiba, while about 12 members of the military and police force had been injured in demonstrations that snarled traffic outside Honduras  main port on Friday and around the country. At least 10 protesters were injured in the capital of Tegucigalpa, according to the city s Hospital Escuela. Military officials called for peaceful protests after police reports of looting in the capital and other cities. In the country s second-biggest city of San Pedro Sula, thick plumes of black smoke clouded the air as protesters burned tires and police tried to disperse the crowds with tear gas. More than 100 people were also arrested on suspicion of looting in San Pedro Sula on Friday, a police spokesman said, and local media carried footage of shops being plundered. People flocked to supermarkets on Friday, stocking up on food and provisions as major roads and supply routes were blocked across the country by angry protesters. Lines appeared outside gas stations and cash machines. Banks clogged up with people wanting to withdraw or deposit money.  I m filling the tank with gas in case anything happens, the situation looks bad and there are protests all over the city,  said Carlos Valle, a 61-year-old pensioner, as he joined a long line of vehicles waiting at a fuel pump in Tegucigalpa. Both Hernandez and Nasralla, a television game show host allied with leftists, claimed victory after the election, and the challenger has said he will not accept the tribunal s result because of doubts over the counting process. Leading a center-left alliance, the 64-year-old Nasralla is one of Honduras  best-known faces and backed by former President Manuel Zelaya, a leftist ousted in a coup in 2009. Zelaya weighed into the debate on Thursday in a letter in which he accused the tribunal of  electoral crimes  on behalf of Hernandez, who himself was standing for re-election enabled by a contentious 2015 Supreme Court ruling. One of the four magistrates on the electoral tribunal on Thursday flagged  serious doubts  about the counting process.  The Organization of American States (OAS) on Wednesday convinced both candidates to vow to respect the final result once disputed votes had been checked. But a few hours later Nasralla rejected the OAS accord, saying his opponents were trying to rob him. He urged supporters to take to the streets in protest. ',\n",
       " 'On Sunday, Scottie Nell Hughes joined a panel discussion on CNN s Reliable Sources where the Trump campaign surrogate defended Donald Trump s characterization of his Democratic challenger Hillary Clinton as a  bigot.  The justification for the label? Clinton is prejudiced against the racist faction of Trump s base.Most of the conversation surrounded the Trump campaigns hiring of Steve Bannon as his campaign CEO. Bannon is officially on a  temporary leave  from his position as the executive chairman for the reactionary (often dubbed as the  alt-right ) right-wing media site, Breitbart. The site caters to an audience that would probably consider Fox News to be a liberal propaganda network.MTV News host, Jamil Smith said during the panel discussion that he considers Breitbart to support white supremacy and racism. I would say that [Breitbart is] part of the white supremacist machine. They are trying to make sure these views become mainstream. And I think, through Trump, they are finding a way to do that. Trump has faced waves of criticism for the move to hire Bannon from Clinton, the left, and even some members of the right. To which Trump referred to Clinton as a bigot for doing so. Here s Hughes justification for the use of the term: Bigotry, if you look at the definition, it s about someone who s small-minded and sits there and directs hate towards a certain group. Hillary Clinton s speech was all about hate towards a group that, while my fellow counterpart might consider them to be very racist, it s the exact opposite. At that point, Hughes dives hot-head first into one of her just this side of unhinged rants, claiming that just because a section of Breitbart s readers are white supremacists, doesn t mean they all are.Smith, apparently noticing that Hughes doesn t understand what he said at all clarifies his position: What they present is the view of the white supremacist mentality through their coverage. It s not necessarily saying,  Well, everyone who works there is a white supremacist.  I don t know that.  Smith continues, finalizing his thoughts,  The point is to say, what kind of viewpoint did they reflect? And it s undeniable that they reflect a white supremacist view if you looked over their coverage over the last several years. I would consider being called a bigot against white supremacists and those who promote it a badge of honor, as I m sure most people would.

Army Corps spokesman Ryan Hignight said contractors working for the agency would enter the camp as soon as they could. “We’re not going to necessarily wait for the 22nd,” Hignight said. Pipeline opponents say they fear fresh conflicts with law enforcement if Army Crops crews, including waste-removal personnel, are accompanied by police.\\xa0 “It’s completely impossible to remove everything down there in that short of a time frame,” said Chase Iron Eyes, a member of the Standing Rock Sioux Tribe. “The people aren’t opposed to the help of the Army Corps, but it’s got to be without the presence of militarized law enforcement.” The exchange came a day after Burgum ordered pipeline opponents to move off of land owned by the Army Corps, citing safety and environmental pollution concerns posed by spring snowmelt and rising water levels in the nearby Cannonball River. Hignight warned that anyone still occupying Army Corps land after the deadline could face fines as high as $5,000 and six-month jail terms. About 700 pipeline opponents have been arrested since August 2016. Environmentalists and Native Americans who have opposed the pipeline, saying it threatens water resources and sacred sites, have faced a series of setbacks since Republican President Donald Trump took office in January. A federal judge on Monday denied a request by Native American tribes seeking to halt construction of the final link of the $3.8 billion pipeline after the Corps of Engineers granted a final easement to Energy Transfer Partners LP last week.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump on Friday welcomed back to the United States Aya Hijazi, an Egyptian-American charity worker whose release from jail in Egypt was sought by Trump when he met Egypt’s president early this month. Trump and his aides had engaged in behind-the-scenes diplomatic efforts to gain her freedom after attempts by the previous Obama administration failed. She was released from jail on Tuesday after nearly three years of detention on human trafficking charges. Aides said Trump had personally requested her release in a meeting April 3 with Egyptian President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi but had done so privately and made no public mention of her case. Hijazi, 30, sat next to Trump in the Oval Office for a meeting that also included Trump’s daughter, Ivanka Trump, her husband, Jared Kushner, and Dina Powell, the top White House aide who accompanied her home on a U.S. military jet on Thursday. Ivanka Trump and Kushner are top advisers to the president. “We are very happy to have Aya back home and it’s a great honor to have her in the Oval Office, with her brother,” Trump said, declining to answer questions about her case.  Hijazi was accompanied by her brother, Basel. Hijazi, an Egyptian who holds U.S. citizenship, was acquitted by a Cairo court on Sunday along with seven others who had worked with street children. Hijazi, 30, was flown to Joint Base Andrews, the U.S. military airfield near Washington. She founded Belady, a non-governmental organization that promotes a better life for street children. She had been in custody for 33 months in violation of Egyptian law, which states that the maximum period for pretrial detention is 24 months.  U.S. officials had raised Hijazi’s case with Egypt soon after Trump took office on Jan. 20, aides said. Pressed on how Trump managed to gain her release when President Barack Obama had not, White House spokesman Sean Spicer said he would leave it to others “to look at the different strategies to see why the president was successful” and Obama was not. Critics had accused the Obama administration of indifference to her case. Since toppling President Mohamed Mursi of the Muslim Brotherhood in mid-2013, Sisi’s government has cracked down on the opposition, killing hundreds of Brotherhood supporters and jailing thousands. The net has widened to include liberal and secular activists.  Two Republican U.S. senators, John McCain of Arizona and Lindsey Graham of South Carolina, called on the Egyptian government to take more steps to improve human rights. “We urge the Government of Egypt to build on this important first step by releasing all those who have been wrongly imprisoned, upholding its international human rights obligations, and respecting the Egyptian people’s right to freedom of expression and rule of law,” they said in a statement.

       " \"NEW YORK (Reuters) - When U.S. Senate Republicans unveil their plan to overhaul America’s healthcare system, they will face a skeptical public that already does not buy the justification for an earlier version that passed the House of Representatives, according to a Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday.\\xa0  The June 9-13 poll shows that a majority of the country thinks the American Health Care Act would be harmful for low-income Americans, people with pre-existing health conditions and Medicaid recipients.  Overall, 41 percent of American adults oppose the House plan, while 30 percent support it. Another 29 percent said they “don’t know,” according to the poll.  “It’ll make people’s deductibles skyrocket” said Shannon Sowards, 39, of Memphis, Tennessee, a Trump supporter who took the poll. “So I’m not for this healthcare act. I’m for insurance for everyone.” The Senate is expected to release its full plan on Thursday. (Click here to view the poll's topline results: tmsnrt.rs/2sqhmM3) The gap between what Republicans say their plan will do and what people think it will do further complicates matters for Senate Republicans, who already have been criticized for drafting their bill in secret. “It would be great if a politican had the nerve to be brutally honest” and tell people that healthcare costs are going up, said Joseph Antos, a healthcare expert at the American Enterprise Institute, a conservative think tank. “None of them seem to.” For years, Republicans have promised voters they would replace Democratic former President Barack Obama’s healthcare law, which they say is too costly and intrusive. When House Republicans pitched their health plan earlier this year, U.S. House Speaker Paul Ryan boasted that it would lower premiums, protect people with pre-existing conditions and improve public “access” to high-quality, low-cost healthcare. U.S. Representative Tom MacArthur of New Jersey, who helped shape the House bill, said it “would make coverage of pre-existing conditions sacrosanct for all Americans.” The nonpartisan Congressional Budget Office, however, presented a different view of the bill. It estimated that under the House plan 23 million people would lose their health coverage by 2026 in an effort to cut the federal deficit. According to the poll, nearly 60 percent of adults said they thought it would make insurance more expensive for low-income Americans and people with pre-existing conditions. Fifty-seven percent said it would make Medicaid less available, and 69 percent said it would cut federal money for Planned Parenthood. Thirteen percent felt that the House plan would improve the quality of their healthcare, and 9 percent said it would make their healthcare cheaper. About 28 percent of Americans said they would be “less likely” to support their congressional representative if he or she supported the House plan. Another 16 percent said they would be “more likely” to support their representative and 33 percent said it would make “no difference.” Republican respondents were more supportive of the House plan than others. And even those Republicans who did not like the House plan said that it is probably an improvement over the current healthcare system. “It’s not going to change my political views” said Barb Huntington, 64, of Murrells Inlet, South Carolina, a Trump supporter who took the poll.  Huntington, who buys health insurance through her state’s Obamacare exchange, said her premiums went up by $25 per month this year. Huntington said she would not be surprised if they keep going up no matter what the Republicans do. “It’s going to be like that every year, and we’ll be lucky to have what we have,” she said. The Reuters/Ipsos poll was conducted online in English across the United States. It gathered responses from 1,492 adults, including 671 Democrats and 501 Republicans. It has a credibility interval, a measure of accuracy, of 3 percentage points for the entire group, 4 percentage points for Democrats and 5 percentage points for Republicans.

       " 'BAGHDAD (Reuters) - Iraq demanded on Thursday that the U.S. government backtrack on a decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel s capital and summoned the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad to protest the decision. U.S. President Donald Trump reversed decades of U.S. policy on Wednesday and recognized Jerusalem as the capital of Israel, imperiling Middle East peace efforts and upsetting the Arab world and Western allies alike. Shi ite-majority Iraq is the only country to have an alliance with regional powerhouse Iran and the United States, who do not see eye-to-eye. The Iraqi Foreign Ministry said it had summoned the U.S. ambassador in Baghdad and that it would hand him a memo protesting Trump s decision.  We caution against the dangerous repercussions of this  decision on the stability of the region and the world,  an Iraqi government statement said.   The U.S. administration has to backtrack on this decision to stop any dangerous escalation that would fuel extremism and create conditions favorable to terrorism,  it said. Iraq s top Shi ite cleric Grand Ayatollah Ali al-Sistani condemned the decision and called on the  Umma , or Islamic nation, to unite its efforts and reclaim Jerusalem.  This decision is condemned and decried, it hurt the feelings of hundreds of millions of Arabs and Muslims,  his office said in a statement.  But it won t change the reality that Jerusalem is an occupied land which should return to the sovereignty of its Palestinian owners no matter how long it takes,  it said. Dozens of Iraqis protested the decision in Baghdad, carrying signs saying  Jerusalem is Arab  and vowing to return in greater numbers the following day after Friday prayers. A prominent Iraqi militia, the Iran-backed Harakat Hezbollah al-Nujaba, said Trump s decision could become a  legitimate reason  to attack U.S. forces in Iraq.  Trump s stupid decision to make Jerusalem a capital for the Zionist will be the big spark for removing this entity from the body of the Islamic nation, and a legitimate reason to target American forces,  said the group s leader Akram al-Kaabi. The United States is leading an international coalition helping Iraq fight Islamic State and has provided air and ground support. It has more than 5,000 troops in Iraq. Nujaba, which has about 10,000 fighters, is one of the most important militias in Iraq. Though made up of Iraqis, it is loyal to Iran and is helping Tehran create a supply route through Iraq to Damascus. It fights under the umbrella of the Popular Mobilisation Forces (PMF), a mostly Iranian-backed coalition of Shi ite militias that played a role in combating Islamic State. The PMF is government sanctioned and formally reports to Prime Minister Haider al-Abadi s office. ',\n",

       " 'GENEVA (Reuters) - Syria s opposition must accept that they have not won the six-and-a-half year war against President Bashar al-Assad, U.N. peace talks mediator Staffan de Mistura said on Wednesday. De Mistura suggested the war was almost over because many countries had got involved principally to defeat Islamic State in Syria, and a national ceasefire should follow soon after. The main rebel-held area, the city of Idlib would be  frozen .   For the opposition, the message is very clear: if they were planning to win the war, facts are proving that is not the case. So now it s time to win the peace,  he told reporters. Asked if he was implying that Assad had won, he said pro-government forces had advanced militarily, but nobody could actually claim to have won the war.   Victory can only be if there is a sustainable political long-term solution. Otherwise instead of war, God forbid, we may see plenty of low intensity guerrilla (conflicts) going on for the next 10 years, and you will see no reconstruction, which is a very sad outcome of winning a war.  De Mistura plans to join ceasefire talks in the Kazakh capital Astana next week, which he said should help resolve the fate of Idlib, a city of 2 million where rebels designated as terrorists by the United Nations are gaining influence.  I am confident...there will be a non-conflictual solution - let s say not a new Aleppo, that s what we want to avoid at any cost, if we have learned from the past,  he said, referring to the greatest battle and humanitarian crisis of the war.  If that takes place Idlib may become frozen in a way in order to avoid becoming a major tragic end to the conflict.  Meanwhile Islamic State was facing imminent defeat in its two main zones of influence - in the city of Raqqa and around the city of Deir al-Zor.  The fact is that Deir al-Zor is almost liberated, in fact it is as far as we are concerned liberated, it s a matter now of a few hours.   Raqqa s fall would follow within days or weeks, leading to the  moment of truth  for a round of negotiations in October. Since early 2016, de Mistura has overseen a tortuous series of peace talks in Geneva that has made almost no visible progress. He said the next round could see an accelerated and more pragmatic approach.  The issue is: is the government, after the liberation of Deir al-Zor and Raqqa, ready and prepared to genuinely negotiate and not simply announce victory, which we all know, and they know too, cannot be announced because it won t be sustainable without a political process?   Will the opposition be able to be unified and realistic enough to realize they did not win the war?  ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Steven Mnuchin said on Thursday he was confident that Congress would raise the federal debt limit  “before there’s an issue” with U.S. creditworthiness, and he pledged that the Trump administration’s tax reform plans would be paid for. “We’re going to get it increased,” Mnuchin told Fox Business Network about the debt limit. “The credit of the United States is the utmost. I’ve said to Congress they should do it as quickly as they can. But we are very focused on working with them and I’m confident we’ll get there before there’s an issue.” Mnuchin said last week that he wanted a “clean” debt ceiling increase before the start of Congress’ summer recess in early August. Mnuchin said that it “makes no sense” to view the Trump administration’s tax reform plans through a “static” budget analysis that does not account for economic growth effects. He has previously pledged that increased economic growth would generate more revenue to offset lower tax rates. “We’re about creating economic growth, we’re about broadening the base and we’re going to make sure that this is tax reform, not just tax cuts, and that they’re paid for,” Mnuchin said.

       " 'Reality Leigh Winner, 25, a federal contractor at the NSA, was arrested for leaking a classified report containing what has been described as  Top Secret Level  information on Russia s attempt to interfere with the 2016 U.S. Presidential election. Winner appeared in federal court on June 5, facing one charge of removing classified material from a government facility and mailing it to a news outlet.Winner was employed by Pluribus International Corporation and had been assigned to a U.S. government facility in Georgia since February, working in a position that granted her a top-level security clearance. She had also previously held a similar clearance with the U.S. Air Force. Her arrest was announced about an hour after The Intercept published a story based on an NSA document detailing Russian attempts to hack American voting systems in 2016. Although the Justice Department hasn t stated whether Winner was arrested in connection with The Intercept s story, the site noted that the National Security Agency (NSA) report cited in its story was dated May 5, a date shared by an affidavit supporting her arrest.According to The Intercept s report, Russian military intelligence, specifically the Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate, or GRU, conducted the cyber attacks described in the document: Russian General Staff Main Intelligence Directorate actors   executed cyber espionage operations against a named U.S. company in August 2016, evidently to obtain information on elections-related software and hardware solutions.   The actors likely used data obtained from that operation to   launch a voter registration-themed spear-phishing campaign targeting U.S. local government organizations. An affidavit sworn by FBI Agent Justin Garrick claimed that the government was notified of the leaked report by the news outlet that received it and the agency that housed the report determined only six employees had made physical copies, one of whom was Winner. The affidavit also stated that Garrick interviewed Winner at her home and she admitted intentionally identifying and printing the classified intelligence reporting at issue  and mailing it to the news outlet. The U.S. Government Agency examined the document shared by the News Outlet and determined the pages of the intelligence reporting appeared to be folded and/or creased, suggesting they had been printed and hand-carried out of a secured space,  the affidavit continued.Titus Thomas Nichols, Winner s attorney, declined to confirm whether his client had been accused of leaking the document. My client has no [criminal] history, so it s not as if she has a pattern of having done anything like this before,  Nichols said in a phone interview on Monday to the Associated Press.  She is a very good person. All this craziness has happened all of a sudden,  adding that she hadn t stated or shown any form of confession.Winner remains in federal custody pending a hearing scheduled for June 8.Featured image via Facebook',\n",
       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - Saad al-Hariri, who quit as Lebanese Prime Minister in a weekend broadcast from Saudi Arabia, has been held under house arrest in the kingdom, a pro-Hezbollah daily said on Tuesday citing unnamed sources. Hariri s office and Saudi-owned media said he flew to the UAE, a Saudi ally and fellow Gulf monarchy, on Tuesday. Aides to Hariri, Lebanon s most influential Sunni politician and a close Saudi ally, have denied claims that he was detained.  Lebanese newspaper al-Akhbar, which is aligned with the Shi ite militant group and political movement Hezbollah, said Hariri  was placed under house arrest hours after arriving in Riyadh last Friday  and had remained in detention since.  On Monday, Saudi Foreign Minister Adel Jubeir dismissed as  nonsense  allegations that the kingdom forced Hariri to resign, and said he was free to leave at any time. Speculation in Lebanon over Hariri s status continued even after Saudi media showed him meeting with King Salman and reported him leaving for the UAE. Hariri s resignation has thrust Lebanon back onto the frontline of the rivalry between Sunni Saudi Arabia and Shi ite Iran that has also wrought upheaval in Syria, Iraq, Yemen and Bahrain.  The coalition government, which Hariri s shock resignation collapsed, included Iran-backed Hezbollah. His declaration came as Saudi Arabia undertook an anti-corruption purge in which royals, ministers and investors have been arrested as the putative next king tightens his grip on power. In a dramatic escalation of the crisis, Saudi Arabia accused Lebanon on Monday of declaring war because of aggression by Hezbollah. Hezbollah leader Sayyed Hassan Nasrallah accused Riyadh last week of forcing Hariri to step down, and said there were  legitimate questions  over whether he had been detained. The al-Akhbar newspaper said that a Saudi security team had been supervising Hariri, citing unnamed sources close to him. The prime minister, whose family made their fortune in the Saudi construction industry, had very limited access to his phones, it said on Tuesday.    Fouad Siniora, a former prime minister and senior member of Hariri s political party, said Hariri would return to Lebanon.  ',\n",

       " 'ASUNCION (Reuters) - Paraguayan Senator Mario Abdo Benitez, a lawmaker with ties to a former Paraguayan dictator, won the ruling Colorado Party s presidential primary on Sunday in a sharp rebuke for President Horacio Cartes, the party s flagbearer. Abdo, the son of former dictator Alfredo Stroessner s private secretary, beat out ex-finance minister Santiago Pena, a young economist and Cartes  hand-picked successor, in a surprise outcome that followed increasing dissatisfaction with Cartes, who has been in power since 2013. Abdo will face lawyer Efrain Alegre, who won the opposition Liberal Party s nomination, in the April presidential election in the land-locked nation of 6.8 million, long one of South America s poorest.  The Colorado party has governed Paraguay for nearly 70 years, including during Stroessner s 1954-1989 dictatorship, with a brief interruption when leftist Fernando Lugo was elected in 2008 and impeached in 2012.  With over 96 percent of primary votes counted, Paraguay s electoral authority said that Abdo had received 50.9 percent of the vote. Pena had garnered 43.3 percent.  The arrogant establishment has been defeated today and forever ... we all have scars but are urging unity for the Colorados and later, Paraguay,  Abdo told his supporters following his victory. Cartes, a former soft-drink and tobacco executive, has run a low-tax policy that investors credit with spurring one of the fastest economic growth rates in Latin America. But his attempt to change laws enabling him to run for re-election spurred protests and was widely criticized. Abdo, known in Paraguay by his nickname  Marito,  has been a harsh critic of Cartes, and aligned with the opposition in Congress to fight his proposed re-election amendment.

       " 'House Republicans leaders on Monday embraced a legislative plan to replace the Affordable Care Act for the first time in the nearly seven years since Democrats enacted the transformative health-insurance law.Now, they have to sell it.That challenge ran into an immediate threat from key conservatives who criticized the new proposal for failing to fulfill the party s iron-clad promise to rip out the signature policy of former President Barack Obama.  It s Obamacare in a different format,  Representative Jim Jordan of Ohio, a member of the hardline House Freedom Caucus, said in a phone interview. Jordan cited three provisions that conservatives have complained about for weeks leading up to the formal release of the House GOP plan on Monday evening: its extension of Obamacare Medicaid expansion for another four years; its failure to immediately repeal all of the law s tax increases; and its call to provide refundable tax credits to help people buy insurance, which Jordan labeled  a new entitlement. Earlier on Monday, another member of the Freedom Caucus, Representative Justin Amash of Michigan, condemned the leadership bill in a two-word tweet:  Obamacare 2.0.  The full Freedom Caucus comprises about three dozen members of the 237 in the House Republican majority. If they voted as a bloc, they could sink the bill on their own. A spokeswoman for its chairman, Representative Mark Meadows of North Carolina, said members were still reviewing the legislation on Monday evening, and Jordan said the group planned to meet on Tuesday to discuss it.The reaction from conservative advocacy groups was no more favorable to the Republican leadership. FreedomWorks labeled the plan s requirement that people pay a 30 percent premium to insurers if they stop their coverage for more than two months  the Republican individual mandate. And on Tuesday morning, two more staunchly conservative activist organizations, Heritage Action and the Club for Growth, came out against the proposal.  Many Americans seeking health insurance on the individual market will notice no significant difference between the Affordable Care Act (i.e., Obamacare) and the American Health Care Act,  the group s president, Michael Needham said.  That is bad politics and, more importantly, bad policy. Rather than accept the flawed premises of Obamacare, congressional Republicans should fully repeal the failed law and begin a genuine effort to deliver on longstanding campaign promises that create a free market health-care system that empowers patients and doctors.  The Club for Growth pejoratively dubbed the new bill  RyanCare  and added a new threat, vowing to downgrade any Republican who votes for the bill in the group s closely-watched annual congressional scorecard.- The AtlanticThe introduction of the GOP s new healthcare bill has raised some definite ire among Republicans and Libertarians alike. Kentucky Senator Rand Paul is one such politician who has now seen the bill and expressed his extreme dislike of it, calling the GOP plan  Obamacare Lite. According to The Hill, Paul is not letting Obamacare Lite happen without a fight, and he has allies. The libertarian leaning senator is teaming up with Rep. Jim Jordan (R-Ohio) to release their own bill to repeal Obamacare on Wednesday, and it s highly similar to the one that Republicans voted for unanimously in 2015. We voted on this last year, and every Republican voted for it,  Paul said at a press conference alongside his House conservative colleagues.  That s what we should do again. You have to get rid of ObamaCare completely,  Jordan added. Paul stated in an interview earlier today that this GOP bill  will not pass,  and that  conservatives aren t gonna to take it.  However Paul and Jordan face an uphill struggle as GOP leadership, including that of President Donald Trump, seem to believe the bill to be a solid plan. We re going to do something that s great. And I am proud to support the replacement plan released by the House of Representatives,  Trump said of the bill.  It follows the guidelines I laid out in my congressional address.

He never showed a single ounce of compassion for any of them and their families. So excuse us if we don t take Joyner s word for it that Trump actually has human feeling beyond pettiness and hate.But that s not all. Joyner also had the gall to call Trump  one of the most honest people  he s ever known. And now we definitely know Joyner is full of shit.As Raw Story points out, Fact-checking website Politifact, who fact-checked at least 337 of Trump s statements on the campaign trail and since his election victory, noted that 19 percent of his claims were  mostly false,  34 percent were  false,  and 18 percent were  pants on fire.' In short, Trump is a serial liar and anyone who says otherwise has their head up his ass.But what Joyner said next is something that Christians in particular, should find extremely offensive. I think if you look at the disciples that Jesus chose, they were all Donald Trump. Every one of them were Donald Trumps. Joyner literally just claimed that Jesus chose a bunch of thin-skinned bigoted sexist liars as his disciples. Seriously.Here s the video via YouTube.Conservatives are truly delusional if they actually think Donald Trump is like Jesus or his disciples. In fact, they should stop calling themselves  Christians  altogether.Featured image via Wikimedia\",\n",
       " 'LONDON (Reuters) - A British parliamentary committee has written to Facebook s Mark Zuckerberg asking for information on any paid-for activity by Russian-linked Facebook accounts around the 2016 EU referendum and the 2017 UK election. The request was made by Damian Collins, chair of parliament s Digital, Media and Sport Committee as part of its effort to gather evidence for an inquiry it is conducting into fake news.  Part of this inquiry will focus on the role of foreign actors abusing platforms such as yours to interfere in the political discourse of other nations,  Collins wrote in a letter to Zuckerberg circulated to media by the committee. He asked Facebook to provide examples of all adverts bought by Russian-linked accounts, of all pages set up by Russian-linked accounts, information on the targeting of such adverts and pages and how many times they were viewed.  I believe that the information I have requested is in line with that already supplied to Facebook to several United States Senate Committees, including the Senate Intelligence Committee, in relation to the 2016 U.S. presidential election,  wrote Collins. The committee of British lawmakers launched its inquiry into fake news in January but it was suspended when a general election was called for June. The closing date for submitting evidence is Nov. 7. The inquiry aims to shed light on issues such as the impact of fake news on public understanding of the world and response to traditional journalism, the responsibilities of social media platforms and how people can be educated to assess news sources. The issue of whether and how much Russia intervened in the 2016 U.S. presidential election is a huge issue in Washington, where it is the subject of multiple investigations. Facebook said on Oct. 2 that some 10 million people in the United States saw politically divisive ads on its network that were purchased in Russia in the months before and after the presidential election. In Britain, interest in whether Russia also played a part in domestic political processes such as the June 2016 referendum on withdrawing from the European Union and the June 2017 general election has been increasing in recent weeks. Last week, another member of parliament, Ben Bradshaw, called on the government to get to the bottom of reports of opaque funding sources for some elements of the pro-Brexit campaign, citing  widespread concern over foreign and particularly Russian interference . Russia has denied interfering in the internal affairs of other countries. ',\n",
       " 'So, the working people of America are basically supposed to sit back and watch Bernie Sanders and Hillary compete to see who can pander to get more votes by promising Americans and illegal aliens more free sh*t with our hard earned money? Like healthcare, education is a sclerotic, overexpensive, underperforming industry. Both have strong parallels: they re dominated by government subsidies and controls, though not entirely socialized; they re perhaps the only growth industries in our moribund economy; and they dominate the thought life of the nation. As Arnold Kling and Nick Schulz pointed out in 2011:These are our foremost growth sectors   the ones most central to employment and consumption; the ones that, increasingly, drive our economy. And it is in precisely these two sectors that the case for extensive government intervention and planning, if not outright control, is dominant   and becoming ever more so.If there is to be any hope of reversing this trend, champions of market economics must come to see these two sectors as the front lines in the battle for capitalism. At stake is not only an ideological or theoretical point, but also American prosperity. The historical record makes this clear: In the nations where it was practiced, government control of the old commanding heights of the economy made those industries less efficient and less innovative   bringing overall economic performance down with them.Today, Hillary Clinton is touting her plan for Obamacare-izing higher education. Competing Democratic presidential candidates Martin O Malley and Bernie Sanders have already proposed essentially socializing college straight up. Clinton s proposal, like Obamacare, is also collectivist and unjustified wealth redistribution, but with a more complicated, less direct, crony capitalist flavor. In other words, it s not direct socialism, but it might as well be.By mucking around this way, Clinton gains the benefit of deception: She can argue that  both the left and the right  (by  right,  she of course means the craziest of Republicans, not actual conservatives) have proposed elements of her plan. So she gets to smear her Frankenstein with pretty  bipartisan  makeup. And the average voter won t care, because the average voter doesn t give jack about enslaving his children (or other people s children) to the unseen but growing monstrosity of federal debt, as long as he gets feel-goodies now, regardless of whether they actually benefit anyone. But it s still a Frankenstein.What Does Hillary Clinton Propose, Exactly? Before we get into the mud-slinging, let s do what most journalists do not and give some actual hard facts about Clinton s proposal. (Do any of you also scan news articles looking for actual facts instead of paid spokespeople s lying spin? It s hard to find those, isn t it?) The full proposal doesn t seem available (probably so they can tweak its details in response to initial criticism); reporters have gotten  three fact sheets,  MSNBC says. Inside Higher Ed kindly posted them. A news summary of the major points: Under the plan, which was outlined by Clinton advisers on Sunday, about $175 billion in grants would go to states that guarantee students would not have to take out loans to cover tuition at four-year public colleges and universities. In return for the money, states would have to end budget cuts to increase spending over time on higher education, while also working to slow the growth of tuition, thought the plan does not require states to cap it.  (NYT) military veterans, lower-income students and those who complete a national service program, like AmeriCorps, would go to school for free in the Clinton plan  (AP). She would also expand income-based repayment programs, allowing every student borrower to enroll in a plan that would cap their payments at 10 percent of their income with remaining debt forgiven after 20 years.  (AP) Student borrowers would be expected to work at least 10 hours a week to contribute, while their families would continue contributing under the current income-based model. Clinton s plan would also expand a tax credit from $1,000 to $2,500 for families paying for college.  (MSNBC) Her campaign says she will create a dedicated fund for Historically Black Colleges and Universities, and will expand AmeriCorps from 75,000 to 250,000 members.  (MSNBC) Mrs. Clinton would pay for the [supposedly $350 billion] plan by capping the value of itemized deductions that wealthy families can take on their tax returns.  (NYT)So more income redistribution and more federal micromanagement because, clearly, central planners know better how to manage college costs than colleges and families. Topped off, of course, by (what else?) playing self-appointed Robin Hood against people who earn lots less money than she does. Envy and greed are our society s favorite sins, after all.Federal Meddling Is the Problem, Not the AnswerThe most expensive portion of Clinton s proposal involves bullying states into following federal marching orders in order for them to receive cash the feds scooped from taxpayers.For entire story: The Federalist',\n",
       " 'Turning up to a Trump rally to oppose the Republican front-runner can be life-threatening, as Trump and his rabid supporters have proven time after time that they re violent, mindless idiots that feel threatened by even the most peaceful of protesters.On Friday during an Oklahoma City rally, a man took a stand against the candidate by reminding everyone about the business mogul s racist rhetoric and connection to white supremacists. The brave protester stood up and stuck his tongue out at Trump, proudly displaying the fact that he was wearing a homemade shirt that said  KKK endorses Trump. As Trump s devout minions noticed the protester s shirt, the audience was overcome with boos and shouting. Trump walked over to the protester, practically stared the man down, then paced the stage while he waited for his security to take the protester away. Meanwhile, Trump s fans chanted  USA, USA, USA . Once the man was gone, Trump took center stage once again and went on a rant against political correctness, saying it was to blame for the slow response to the protester. You see, in the good old days, law enforcement acted a lot quicker than this! A lot quicker. In the good old days, they d rip him out of that seat so fast, but today everyone is politically correct. Our country is going to hell for being politically correct. Going to hell. You can watch the confrontation below:Considering that earlier this week, Trump faced another protester and threatened to  punch him in the face , this response from Trump was mild.Although Trump removed the protester, the man had hit on a part of Trump s campaign that the GOPer is now trying to distance himself from. Just hours before this confrontation, Trump had brushed off the support of former Ku Klux Klan grand wizard David Duke, who d said not voting for Trump would be against Americans   heritage.  Before quickly changing the subject, the front runner said, David Duke endorsed me? OK, alright. I disavow, OK? While Trump may be trying to pretend that he s not a racist, it doesn t reverse the fact that Trump has retweeted various white supremacists and is a favorite candidate amongst the most racist people in our country.

       " 'From the Vanity Fair article: Milo Yiannopoulos, the former tech editor at Breitbart, has made political provocations, often deeply offensive ones, a business model. But his career seemed to come crashing down in recent months when one of his speaking appearances, at the University of California, Berkeley, led to riots. Weeks later, videos emerged of Yiannopoulos seeming to condone pedophilia. ( I do not support pedophilia. Period. It is a vile and disgusting crime, perhaps the very worst,  Yiannopoulos said in a statement on Facebook at the time.)Yet his allies turned on him. Yiannopoulos was subsequently forced out of Breitbart in disgrace. The American Conservative Union disinvited him from CPAC, and Simon & Schuster canceled a six-figure book deal.But as the free-speech conflagration he ignited at Berkeley continues to burn, Yiannopoulos is planning a way back in. Days after releasing a video touting his return to the campus, Yiannopoulos told the Hive that he would be launching a new media venture in the coming weeks with what he says is a $12 million investment from backers whose identities he is protecting. (Yiannopoulos showed me a page from the contract with the investors  names blacked out.) Another person involved with the company, who spoke on the condition of anonymity, was similarly secretive:  Milo has the best instincts about these things,  he said.The business, which will be called Milo Inc., will be even more focused on stoking the sort of ugly political conflict that s closer to the surface of what can be best described as corporatized trolling via live entertainment, with Yiannopoulos and his investors hosting events featuring right-wing talent.  The business of Madonna became touring,  said Yiannopoulos in a phone interview, citing the artist s deal with Live Nation.  I m doing the same thing, but instead of signing up with Live Nation, I m building one. I m building it for libertarian and conservative comedians, writers, stand-up comics, intellectuals, you name it. This video pretty much sums up the truth about Milo and his free-speech rights being shut down by violent leftists:Milo Inc. s first event will be a return to the town that erupted in riots when he was invited to speak earlier this year. In fact, Yiannopoulos said that he is planning a  week-long celebration of free speech  near U.C. Berkeley, where a speech by his fellow campus agitator, Ann Coulter, was recently canceled after threats of violence. It will culminate in his bestowing something called the Mario Savio Award for Free Speech.

       " 'After it was announced that President Trump was seriously considering moving the U.S. embassy to Jerusalem, he was roundly criticized by the anti-Trump media. Today, Democrats have announced they are drawing up the impeachment papers. Pope Francis appealed to President Trump to reconsider his decision so as not to offend anyone. In his appeal, Pope Francis said,  Jerusalem is a unique city, sacred to Jews, Christians, and Muslims who venerate the holy places of their respective religions, and has a special vocation to peace.   And yawn in Gaza, where the more things change, the more they stay the same, Palestinians burned the U.S. and Israeli flags.The media will try to make everyone believe that Palestinians loved us when Obama was President, even though there is no truth to that fantasy. (See image below)Daily Mail   President Donald Trump announced Wednesday that America formally recognizes Jerusalem as Israel s capital city, changing decades of U.S. policy in a brief afternoon speech and casting the move as a bid to preserve, not derail, aspirations for regional peace.Appearing in the White House s Diplomatic Reception Room against an elaborate backdrop of Christmas decorations, He also said the United States embassy in Israel would, over time, be moved there from Tel Aviv.Israel is the only country where the United States has an embassy in a city that the host nation does not consider its capital. I have determined that it is time to officially recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel,  Trump said.  While previous presidents have made this a major campaign promise, they failed to deliver. Today I am delivering. When I came into office I promised to look at the world s challenges with open eyes and very fresh thinking,  he said, leaning heavily on a mid-1990s federal law that demanded the embassy s relocation. We have declined to acknowledge any Israeli capital   at all,  Trump added.  But today we finally acknowledge the obvious, that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. This is nothing more or less than a recognition of reality. It is also the right thing to do. It is something that has to be done. Matthew Continetti of the Washington Free Beacon seems to think so. Continetti wrote the best piece on Trump s bold decision to move the embassy that we have seen to date.Not only is President Trump s decision to recognize Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and begin the process of moving the U.S. embassy there one of the boldest moves of his presidency. It is one of the boldest moves any U.S. president has made since the beginning of the Oslo  peace process  in 1993. That process collapsed at Camp David in 2000 when Yasir Arafat rejected President Clinton s offer of a Palestinian state. And the process has been moribund ever since, despite multiple attempts to restart it.That is why the warnings from Trump critics that his decision may wreck the peace process ring hollow. There is no peace process to wreck. The conflict is frozen. And the largest barriers to the resumption of negotiations are found not in U.S. or Israeli policy but in Palestinian autocracy, corruption, and incitement. Have the former Obama administration officials decrying Trump s announcement read a newspaper lately? From listening to them, you d think it would be all roses and ponies in the Middle East but for Trump. In fact, the region is engulfed in war, terrorism, poverty, and despotism; Israel faces threats in the north and south; its sworn enemy, Iran, is growing in influence and reach; and the delegitimization of the Jewish State proceeds apace in international organizations and on college campuses. I forget how the Obama administration advanced the cause of peace by pressuring Israel while rewarding the largest state sponsor of terrorism in the world. Maybe someone will remind me.A similar form of doublethink is present in our discussions over Jerusalem. Every Israeli knows Jerusalem was, is, and will remain his capital. Every recent president has agreed with him. And the U.S. consensus has been bipartisan. The last four Democratic platforms have said the obvious: that Jerusalem is Israel s capital. The Senate voted 90-0 only six months ago urging the embassy be moved to the ancient city. Were we to take seriously neither these platforms nor that vote? Was it all virtue-signaling, a bunch of empty gestures in the kabuki theater of U.S. diplomacy?It is a sign of the disingenuousness of American foreign policy that it required someone from outside this system to behave as if words have meaning. President Trump has no background in or admiration for the routines, manners, and norms of the U.S. foreign service, especially that part of it which specializes in the Israeli-Palestinian conflict. This has enabled him to state unequivocally the fact others would prefer to avoid: Jerusalem is Israel s capital, full stop. His transactional nature also brought him to this fateful recognition. In March 2016, at the AIPAC policy conference, he pledged that  We will move the American embassy to the eternal capital of the Jewish people, Jerusalem.  His remarks today make clear his intention to fulfill that promise and to cement his support within the pro-Israel community.I wonder about the journalists and flacks and politicians criticizing this literal reading of U.S. law as  disruptive.  Have they not paid attention to this man? Donald Trump s purpose in office is to disrupt if not overturn the patterns of governance and ideological consensus that have dominated the U.S. capital for decades. In this sense, his Jerusalem policy is his presidency in microcosm. He is acting on a common sense appraisal of the world and satisfying the wishes of his supporters without regard to global or domestic elite opinion. What Trump knows more than the art of the deal is the art of the bluff and how to call one. By keeping his campaign promise today, he has called the bluff of everyone who thought the United States could have its cake and eat it too on the question of Israel s capital. And by moving our embassy to Jerusalem, the United States will acknowledge Israel s right to determine its own capital city. That is not something to condemn or fear. It is something to be proud of.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The presidents of the United States and Mexico spoke by phone on Friday after relations between the neighboring countries frayed further over Donald Trump’s border wall plan, with the U.S. leader calling the talk friendly but still demanding reworked trade and other ties. The call between Trump and Enrique Pena Nieto came a day after the Mexican president scrapped a meeting set for next week at the White House over Trump’s demand that Mexico pay for a multibillion-dollar wall along the lengthy southern U.S. border with Mexico. Mexico insists it will not pay for it. Both countries issued statements saying Trump and Pena Nieto recognized their clear differences of opinion on the payment demand, and agreed to settle the matter as part of a broader discussion on all aspects of the two nations’ relationship. Financial markets took news of the call as a sign that the crisis in U.S-Mexican relations just days after Trump took office had eased. Mexico’s peso rose on the news. Mexico’s government statement said Trump and Pena Nieto agreed not to talk publicly for now about payment for the wall. The White House did not immediately clarify whether Trump had agreed not to publicly discuss how the wall would be paid for. During a joint news conference at the White House with visiting British Prime Minister Theresa May after the call, Trump did not mention the wall even as he spoke expansively about U.S. relations with Mexico. “As you know, Mexico - with the United States - has out-negotiated us and beat us to a pulp through our past leaders. They’ve made us look foolish,” Trump told the news conference. “We have a trade deficit of $60 billion with Mexico. On top of that, the border is soft and weak, drugs are pouring in,” added Trump, who during the U.S. presidential campaign accused Mexico of sending rapists and other criminals into the United States. The United States had a $58.8 billion trade deficit with its southern neighbor in the 11 months ending last November. Trump called his hour long talk with Pena Nieto “very, very friendly,” said he has a “very good relationship” with him and expressed “great respect for Mexico.” Mexico and the White House both called the meeting productive and constructive. Nevertheless, Trump showed no signs of backing off pledges to renegotiate the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) with Mexico and Canada and slap high tariffs on American companies that have moved jobs south of the border. Mexico sends 80 percent of its exports to the United States, and about half of Mexico’s foreign direct investment over the past two decades has come from its northern neighbor. “We are going to be working on a fair relationship and a new relationship” with Mexico, Trump told the news conference with May. “But the United States cannot continue to lose vast amounts of business, vast amounts of companies and millions and millions of people losing their jobs. That won’t happen with me.” Trump said the United States will renegotiate trade deals and other aspects of America’s relationship with Mexico, adding, “And in the end I think it will be good for both countries.” U.S. congressional leaders said on Thursday they would take up legislation to provide $12 billion to $15 billion to pay for the wall. Trump, who has insisted that Mexico will reimburse the United States for the entire cost, signed a directive on Wednesday for the wall to proceed, part of a package of measures aimed at curbing illegal immigration. The wall plan has angered Mexicans, and Trump’s policies toward Mexico have put Pena Nieto on the defensive. The Republican president views the wall, a major promise during his election campaign, as part of a package of measures to curb illegal immigration. Mexico has long insisted it will not heed Trump’s demands to pay for the construction project.  On Thursday, White House spokesman Sean Spicer sent the Mexican peso falling when he told reporters that Trump wanted a 20 percent tax on Mexican imports to pay for the wall. Spicer gave few details, but his comments resembled an existing idea, known as a border adjustment tax, that the Republican-led U.S. House of Representatives is considering as part of a broad tax overhaul. Trump said in an interview with the Christian Broadcasting Network on Friday that there were options besides an import tax that could be “much more positive” for both countries. The White House said Friday’s call also covered “the importance of the friendship between the two nations, and the need for the two nations to work together to stop drug cartels, drug trafficking and illegal guns and arms sales.” Mexico’s government said the U.S. trade deficit also came up. In Mexico City, billionaire Mexican businessman Carlos Slim  said a united Mexico was ready to help the government negotiate with Trump and called on all political parties to support Pena Nieto in his discussions with the U.S. president. In a rare news conference by the generally media-shy mogul, Slim said Mexico needed to negotiate from a position of strength, noting that Trump, who he called a “great negotiator,” represented a major change in how politics will be conducted.

       " 'Thank God she has a vagina, otherwise her blatant hypocrisy might be an issue with voters Hillary Clinton is facing more questions about her close ties to Wall Street financial institutions. Last week, the New York Times urged Clinton to release transcripts of her highly-compensated speeches to Wall Street firm Goldman Sachs.The paid speeches are just a slim chapter of her relationship with financial titans. According to Clinton Foundation records, Wall Street financial institutions have donated around $40 million to the eponymous family foundation.As a non-profit, the Clinton Foundation isn t legally required to disclose its donors or contributions. The Foundation has publicly disclosed some contributions on its website. It only provides ranges for contributions, e.g. $1-5 million, and doesn t detail when the contribution was made or for what purpose, if any.Here s the chart of contributions from Wall Street to the Clinton Foundation.All together, contributions from readily identifiable Wall Street institutions to the Foundation total somewhere between $11 million and $41 million in contributions. If we assume the donations fall in the middle of the ranges disclosed by the Clinton Foundation, the contributions would total just under $30 million.As with most things involving the Clintons, the devil is in the details. This total of contributions does not include those made by individuals with strong Wall Street ties. It also does not necessarily represent the total amounts contributed to the Foundation from those donors listed. It only accounts for the donations which the Foundation has chosen to disclose.The failure of the Foundation to include any information on the timing of the donations is especially worrisome. In terms of donor relationships, there is a real difference between a one-time gift of $1 million and an ongoing gift of $200,000 for 5 straight years. The total dollar amount may be the same, but an ongoing gift usually requires a more substantive relationship between the Foundation and the donor.There is, of course, an added dimension to the timing issue with the Clintons. During the life of the Foundation, Hillary Clinton has been a US Senator, Secretary of State and two-time candidate for President.When the Clinton Foundation discloses that the  Friends of Saudi Arabia  contributed $1-5 million, it begs the obvious question of when that donation was made. The specific date of that donation is particularly important, given Clinton s considerable focus on the Middle East while she was Secretary of State.It is also important to note that these contributions are completely seperate from the paid speeches made by Bill and Hillary Clinton. In 2013 alone, Hillary earned just over $3 million in paid speeches to financial firms and institutions.These contributions, obviously, also don t include direct contributions made by Wall Street institutions and individuals to either of Clinton s Presidential campaigns.For entire story: Breitbart News',\n",

       " 'UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - Brazilian President Michel Temer criticized a rise in nationalism around the world and said in a speech to the United Nations General Assembly on Tuesday that protectionism was not the solution to economic difficulties faced by countries.    Temer also expressed concern about the deterioration of human rights in Venezuela, where the socialist government has been accused by opponents of becoming a dictatorship.  We are on the side of the Venezuelan people. In South America there is no more room for alternatives to democracy,  Temer said. Brazil, Latin America s largest economy, was emerging from its worst recession and the government was making progress in controlling its budget deficit and restoring credibility to  economic policies, Temer said in the speech. With food exports driving the recovery of the agribusiness powerhouse, Temer called for improved market access for farm goods and the elimination of agricultural subsidies that distort trade. International cooperation on climate change cannot wait, Temer said. Brazil has been criticized for not protecting the Amazon rainforest, an important area for global environmental balance, but Temer said data showed that deforestation fell 20 percent last year. On Monday, Temer, other Latin American leaders and U.S. President Donald Trump discussed oil-producing Venezuela s economic and political crisis and ways to encourage a return to democracy. Trump said in his speech to the annual U.N. gathering on Tuesday that the situation in Venezuela was unacceptable and the United States would step up pressure on the government of President Nicolas Maduro. Temer said Brazil and its partners of the South American Mercosul bloc would continue to support a democratic transition in Venezuela. Conservative Temer, who replaced leftist President Dilma Rousseff last year after a controversial impeachment, faces strong opposition himself amid corruption charges. His government s approval has plummeted according to a public opinion poll published on Tuesday. Polling firm MDA said that just 3.4 percent of those surveyed thought the Temer government was doing a  great or good  job - down from 10.3 percent in February. ',\n",
       " ' (Corrects this Nov. 14 to clarify details of Bolton’s recess appointment, paragraph 8.) By Warren Strobel and John Walcott WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Despite his professed opposition to the 2003 U.S. invasion of Iraq, President-elect Donald Trump is considering several of the major advocates of that war for top national security posts in his administration, according to Republican officials. Among those who could find places on Trump’s team are former top State Department official John Bolton and ex-CIA Director James Woolsey. Both men championed the Iraq invasion, which many analysts have called one of the major U.S. foreign policy debacles of modern times. Also involved in transition planning for Trump’s presidency is Frederick Fleitz, a top aide to Bolton who earlier worked at the CIA unit that validated much of the flawed intelligence on Iraq’s weapons of mass destruction programs. Although it is impossible to predict how a Trump foreign policy might evolve, one U.S. official who has served in Iraq said advocates of the 2003 invasion might be more inclined to commit additional U.S. forces to the fight against Islamic State there, despite the absence of a status of forces agreement that protects Americans from Iraqi legal action. Paul Pillar, the top U.S. intelligence official for the Near East from 2000 to 2005, said that because Trump had little foreign policy experience and had given conflicting accounts of what policies he would pursue, the Republican president-elect’s senior personnel appointments would be crucial. “What we’re seeing going on - and we should be worried about it - is a new president who on so many foreign policy issues has been all over the map,” said Pillar, now at Georgetown University. “Thus, the senior appointments game that we go through every four years has more consequences than it usually does.”   Bolton, who is under consideration as Trump’s secretary of state, the officials said, and Woolsey, reported to be in the running for U.S. director of national intelligence, did not respond to requests for comment. The Trump transition team also did not immediately respond when asked for comment.Even if Bolton is nominated, Senate confirmation is not a foregone conclusion. In 2005, Senate Democrats - with the support of a single Republican – blocked a vote to confirm him as U.S. ambassador to the United Nations. He was appointed to that post by Republican President George W. Bush while the Senate was in recess. Fleitz, in a brief phone conversation, confirmed he was involved in Trump’s transition effort, but declined further comment.  A return to power for the three officials would represent a change of fortune for them and other “neoconservatives” who provided the intellectual backing for the invasion of Iraq. During the presidential campaign, some leading neoconservatives and Republican foreign policy veterans opposed Trump, saying he was unfit to lead. The group saw its clout wane in Bush’s second term, as U.S. troops in Iraq found themselves mired in a sectarian civil war, and has watched from the sidelines during Democratic President Barack Obama’s eight years in power. Trump, who takes office on Jan. 20, has said he opposed the invasion of Iraq, in which more than 4,000 U.S. troops and hundreds of thousands of Iraqis died, and which led to the creation of al Qaeda in Iraq, the forerunner to the violent, ultra-hardline Islamic State group. Iraqi dictator Saddam Hussein’s weapons of mass destruction and ties to al Qaeda, used to justify the invasion, proved to be nonexistent.  “As you know, for years I’ve been saying: ‘Don’t go into Iraq.’ They went into Iraq. They destabilized the Middle East. It was a big mistake,” Trump said in August 2015 on NBC’s “Meet the Press” program. His account that he always opposed the war was challenged during the campaign by Democratic rival Hillary Clinton, who cited a 2002 interview Trump gave to radio host Howard Stern in which he replied: “Yeah I guess so” when asked if he supported invading Iraq. Consideration of Bolton, Woolsey and others is “another demonstration of how those who supported one of the biggest mistakes in American foreign policy have not been - they don’t seem to be sufficiently discredited to be removed from the Washington foreign policy dialogue,” Pillar said.

       " 'VIENNA (Reuters) - Austria s far-right Freedom Party (FPO) on Tuesday accused Foreign Minister Sebastian Kurz of stealing its platform on immigration and the economy ahead of a parliamentary election, which he is favorite to win. FPO leader Heinz-Christian Strache s comments come a day after Kurz presented plans for his conservative People s Party (OVP) for a slimmer state, changes in corporate tax law and cuts to benefits for foreigners.  The program Kurz presented is almost identical to the FPO economic program. We are still waiting for the presentation of the OVP s own economic plan,  Strache told Reuters. Kurz has led opinion polls ahead of the Oct. 15 election with just over 30 percent. The Freedom Party and the center-left Social Democrats (SPO) trail with around 25 percent each.   The conservatives and the far right have enough common ground on migration, taxes and education to launch coalition talks if the vote does not yield a clear winner, said political analyst Peter Filzmaier. Austria s system of proportional representation will likely lead to another coalition government. A coalition of the SPO and OVP has held power since 2006 but is unpopular because it failed to agree major reforms on job creation, investment and taxes.  Given Sebastian Kurz s popularity, a coalition between the OVP and the FPO seems to be the most likely outcome,  said Vienna-based analyst Peter Hajek. Kurz told reporters on Tuesday he did not rule out working with any party and was  equidistant  from the FPO and the SPO. A cartoon in daily newspaper Kurier showed a naked Strache in a police station telling an officer Kurz had stolen  everything  from him. The FPO and OVP focus on the free market, a small state and low taxes. The SPO wants new taxes, including on wealth and inheritance and subsidies to promote job creation. The Social Democrats under Chancellor Christian Kern have begun to consider cooperation with the Freedom Party but Kern this week said his party was  light years  from it.   The Freedom Party s popularity rose to a high during Europe s migration crisis in 2015 when it denounced the government s decision to open Austria s borders to hundreds of thousands of refugees and migrants.  It led polls for more than a year with support above 30 percent and its candidate came close to winning last year s presidential election. Tens of thousands of people from the Middle East, Afghanistan and Africa have arrived in Austria in the past two years, raising public spending on social benefits and fuelling support for policy makers who advocate cutting migration.

       " 'A legacy of hate and division from an unapologetic and arrogant President who promised to  transform  the United States of America. And so it goes, America s  first black President  has successfully divided our nation, pitting American against American, while elevating those who break the law over those who risk their lives to protect our neighborhoods and communities. He has offered cover for those who illegally entered our country, while ignoring the danger he poses to our national security by allowing unvetted immigrants into our country from nations who hate us. Yet unbelievably, while America burns, the Left is arguing we need to elect our  first female President  to carry out his dangerous and destructive legacy. Sorry, but we ll pass News flash: President Obama didn t learn anything in eight years in the White House. And he s proud of it.Sadly, this is the only promise Obama kept to the American voters:As Obama admitted in an interview with New York magazine:  If you go back and you read speeches I made when I was running for the US Senate in 2003, or if you go back further and you look at statements I made when I was on the Harvard Law Review, my worldview is pretty consistent. The comment was a point of pride, which makes it doubly tragic. Once the smartest man in the room, always the smartest man in the room.Never mind that the world is on fire, that America is polarized, angry and scared. Or that ObamaCare is a sick patient, that the economy is growing at a snail s pace and that many cities are racial war zones.It s not Obama s fault. None of it. He would do it all again.With voters fixated on his successor, Obama is fixated on his legacy. A large part of his effort on the way out the door is explaining what he did, and insisting that what he did was right. Always.There s no news there, but there is some valuable insight from the ways he defends the indefensible. Let it be a warning to Donald Trump and Hillary Clinton about the pitfalls of the power they are seeking.If nothing else, the winner should take the oath of office next January armed with the knowledge that hubris is the common thread in Obama s many failures.For example, the president says his secret sauce was that he  trusted my judgment  but didn t  trust the noise out there,  meaning Republicans, talk radio, cable TV and pretty much everybody else who didn t agree with him.At some point, he said, he concluded his critics were  not even trying to be fair-minded in their assessments or recommendations,  and he found that liberating because he could ignore them.Whether it was enforcing his red line in Syria, which he didn t, or substituting executive orders for congressional action, he expressed no regret. He was right and everybody else was wrong.It s a remarkable notion, yet plainly a trend when government is the largest special interest, one that uses and abuses its power to look out for itself. Especially under liberals, it only admits failure to demand more power.This is no small feat. Consider that way back in the reign of George W. Bush, it was universally accepted that a president ought to be held accountable for national problems. A war that didn t work out as planned, a natural disaster or an economic one all fell on the head of the occupant of the Oval Office.But Obama and his apologists cleverly reversed the dynamic. Now the American public is to blame when things go wrong.It s because people are  deplorables  or some other ignorant form of life that leads them to resist wise choices government makes for them. If only the people were smart enough and honest enough to understand how lucky they are, the country would be better off.Throughout this interview and others, it is clear that Obama is leaving office with both his worldview and his prejudices firmly intact. Recall that during the 2008 campaign, talking to donors in San Francisco, he said that white working-class people in Pennsylvania and places like it were falling behind economically and  they get bitter, they cling to guns or religion or antipathy toward people who aren t like them. That s the most quoted part of his remarks, but the rest of it was equally snobbish: Those same people, he said, also cling to  anti-immigrant sentiment or anti-trade sentiment as a way to explain their frustrations. Imagine if Obama had listened to those people, instead of shutting them out as noise. Imagine if he had seen their problems as legitimate, instead of seeing them as backwoods bigots.But he didn t, and so he leaves the country more bitterly divided than when he began. And, as I have said before, Trump s rise through his focus on immigration and trade are a big part of Obama s legacy. Via: NYP ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The American Civil Liberties Union on Friday launched the first legal challenge to President Donald Trump’s new restrictions on people entering the United States from eight countries. The civil rights group said in a statement that it will seek to amend an existing lawsuit in Maryland federal court that was filed against Trump’s previous March 6 ban. In a letter filed with U.S. District Court Judge Theodore Chuang, the ACLU said the new proposal announced on Sunday violates the U.S. Constitution as well as federal immigration law. Trump’s new ban places indefinite restrictions on travel to the United States for citizens from Iran, Libya, Syria, Yemen, Somalia, Chad and North Korea. Certain government officials from Venezuela will also be barred.   The ACLU will seek an injunction that would block visa and entry restrictions on those affected. Challengers of Trump’s immigration restrictions have said the bans are aimed at following through on a pledge he made on the campaign trail in 2016 to block Muslims from entering the country. “President Trump’s newest travel ban is still a Muslim ban at its core, and it certainly engages in discrimination based on national origin, which is unlawful,” said the ACLU’s executive director, Anthony Romero. “We’ll see President Trump in court - again,” he added. The new ban, Trump’s third, could affect tens of thousands of potential immigrants and visitors. Trump has argued that the restrictions fulfill his campaign pledge to tighten immigration and security. “The Department of Justice will continue to vigorously defend the president’s inherent authority to keep this country safe,” said Justice Department spokesman Ian Prior. The ACLU represents several nonprofit groups, including the International Refugee Assistance Project as well as individuals who say they would be affected by the ban, which goes into effect on Oct. 18. Chuang was one of two district court judges who blocked Trump’s second travel ban, saying “it is likely that its primary purpose remains the effectuation of the proposed Muslim ban.” Legal experts say the new ban is likely on more solid footing than the previous bans, in part because it was implemented following a detailed review by federal agencies. Trump’s first travel ban aimed at seven Muslim-majority countries, issued soon after he took office in January, was blocked by courts following chaotic scenes at airports. The second ban, targeting six countries, was blocked by lower courts and partially revived by the Supreme Court in June. ',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - New Jersey and Maine ended partial government shutdowns just in time for the Fourth of July holiday on Tuesday, helping New Jersey Governor Chris Christie move past the embarrassment of being photographed on a beach that had been closed to the public. Both states had suspended non-essential services for three days after failing to reach budget agreements. Their Republican governors signed the budget bills after late-night negotiations with their respective state legislatures. New Jersey and Maine were two of nine states that had missed their deadlines for enacting budgets in time for the July 1 start of the fiscal year. Christie signed a $34.7 billion budget measure that included reshaping the state’s largest health insurer, Horizon Blue Cross Blue Shield of New Jersey, which covers 3.8 million people in the state. All state parks and beaches would be open for the Fourth of July holiday and state offices would be open as usual on Wednesday, the governor said. Christie had remained unapologetic after the Star-Ledger newspaper captured the photos by hiring a plane to fly the New Jersey coastline, showing Christie with family and friends on a state beach on Sunday that was otherwise deserted because of the shutdown. The scandal became a popular topic on social media with images of Christie in his beach chair superimposed into places such as famous beach scenes in the movies “From Here to Eternity” and “Planet of the Apes.” Christie played down the kerfuffle. “If they had flown that plane over the beach and I was sitting next to a 25-year-old blonde in that beach chair next to me, that’s a story,” Christie said. While states have mostly recovered since the 2007-2009 recession, their revenue growth has not always kept pace with the national economy. Illinois is in its third year without an enacted budget. In Connecticut and Pennsylvania, lower-than-anticipated income tax collections exacerbated budget gaps and led to disputes over how to close them. Maine Governor Paul LePage announced on Twitter that he had signed a budget for the fiscal years 2018 and 2019. “The Maine state government shutdown is now over. Happy Fourth of July!” LePage said. “I have signed a budget with no tax increase. I thank the House Republicans for standing strong for the Maine people,” he said in a second tweet.Maine state police, parks and offices responsible for collecting revenue had all planned to work through the shutdown, the state’s first since 1991.

       " 'ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan described the United Arab Emirates foreign minister as impertinent and spoiled by money on Thursday after he retweeted accusations that Ottoman forces looted the holy city of Medina during World War One. Without naming him, Erdogan said UAE Foreign Minister Sheikh Abdullah bin Zayed Al Nahayan - who shared a tweet accusing Ottoman troops led by Fakhreddin Pasha of stealing money and manuscripts from Medina in 1916 - was ignorant.  Some impertinent man sinks low and goes as far as accusing our ancestors of thievery ... What spoiled this man? He was spoiled by oil, by the money he has,  Erdogan told an awards ceremony at his Ankara palace.  When my ancestors were defending Medina, you impudent (man), where were yours? First, you have to give account for this,  he added.  The United Arab Emirates, a close U.S. ally, sees Erdogan s Islamist-rooted ruling party as a friend of Islamist forces the UAE opposes across the Arab world. Relations were further strained by Ankara s support for Qatar after Saudi Arabia, the UAE, Bahrain and Egypt imposed sanctions on the Gulf emirate in June. Two months later, Sheikh Abdullah criticized what he called Turkey and Iran s  colonial  actions in Syria, though Turkey and the UAE have both opposed Syrian President Bashar al-Assad. Medina, now part of Saudi Arabia, was under Ottoman rule until the empire s collapse at the end of World War One. On Wednesday, Erdogan said Fakhreddin Pasha, who led the Ottoman forces, had not stolen from Medina or its people but strived to protect the city - where the Prophet Muhammad was buried - and its occupants during a time of war.  Believe me, this man who insulted us, who disrespected us, wouldn t even know what the holy relics are. They are ignorant like this,  Erdogan said.  ',\n",
       " 'TORONTO (Reuters) - U.S. Republican presidential candidate Donald Trump can be pursued for some claims made by investors in a hybrid hotel-condo tower in Toronto bearing his name, according to a Canadian court ruling released on Thursday. An Ontario appeals court reversed an earlier decision to throw out a case brought against Trump and associates by the investors, who said they were misled into investing in the development in Toronto’s financial district. The investors bought units in the tower that were then placed into a pool of rooms to be rented out at luxury rates by the hotel’s operator. “There would be no factual or legal basis to hold my client liable, principally because my client did not enter into a contract with any of the buyers, did not sell anything to any of the buyers, and did not receive any money from any of the buyers,” said Alan Garten, general counsel for the Trump Organization. A lawyer representing all the defendants, Symon Zucker, said he was still reviewing the judgment to determine the merits of an appeal, but said he was pleased it contained no adverse findings against either Trump or his associate. “As to the balance of the claim, should it be pursued, we believe that it has no chance of being successful,” he said.  The 65-story property is managed by the Trump Organization. Lawyers for Trump and two others had argued that no misrepresentations had been made or that in any event they should not attract personal liability. Trump won a victory last year when a lower court absolved the real estate businessman of any personal responsibility, as his company had only licensed the Trump name to Talon International Development Inc, which owns the property. In the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruling published on Thursday, Justice Paul Rouleau dismissed claims against Trump and two associates for misrepresentation and breach of a ruling by a securities regulator. However, the judge said it was unfair for the original ruling to dismiss claims “based on oppression, collusion, or breach of fiduciary duties,” and said these can still be heard in court. Trump “is still a defendant in this action...and he can still be held liable to these people for damages,” said Mitchell Wine, a lawyer for the plaintiffs.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “This court said you’re still very much part of this thing, and you still have to answer to all of these allegations other than the two that the court considered in this decision.” The ruling also said Talon must pay damages to one buyer for “negligent misrepresentation” and another sale must be rescinded.

       " 'Assuming Hillary Clinton wins Tuesday s election, as she s predicted to do, she will owe at least part of her success to the Senate Minority Leader and Senior Senator from Nevada, Harry Reid.Nevada, which is a traditional red state, is a tossup this year. FiveThirtyEight shows both Donald Trump and Clinton in a statistical near tie, but early voting trends seem to be putting the race firmly in Clinton s camp. This is especially good news for Clinton because if she wins Nevada s six electoral votes, it will mean that she can still afford to lose Florida and North Carolina. Trump won t (and doesn t) have that luxury. If Clinton does win, that will be Reid s doing:Yet about one thing Trump was right: Harry Reid built this. After two years of boosting voter registration among key Democratic demographics, the retiring Senate minority leader has brought turnout among Hispanics in the state to record levels. In doing so, he s almost surely delivered the state for Hillary Clinton and possibly with it the presidential race (Trump has only the narrowest path to 270 electoral votes without Nevada). The reality of this election is that if Clinton wins, especially if she ends up needing Nevada, it s not a stretch to declare that Reid was the single most important person in her victory.Source: PoliticoTrump is complaining about the turnout of Latino voters, but he has no one to blame but himself. His campaign began by attacking Mexican immigrants and calling them  rapists  and  drug dealers,  and it expanded into an all out attack on immigrants. Then, there was the judge he said couldn t be partial since he was  Mexican.  The judge isn t. He s Mexican-American. Or, there are Trump s attacks on Univision s Jorge Ramos. The list could go on, but it s cost Trump big. Clinton has the support of 3/4 of Latinos and Trump has the lowest approval rating among Latinos than anyone in more than 30 years.Reid s ground operation exploited the fear and loathing of Trump to the max, and the early results bear it out: Whereas the Latino vote was 15 percent of the Nevada electorate in 2008 and 18 percent in 2012, data I have seen shows now it is up 30 percent from 2012 in early voting, meaning it could go above 20 percent of all voters by Tuesday evening. We ve been focused on registering and building our Latino turnout from Day 1,  said one Democratic organizer.  That is paying dividends with Latino turnout up in the early vote and potentially up overall. In five out of the six highest Hispanic precincts, turnout in the early vote exceeded  12. Right now, Nevada appears almost un-winnable for Trump. If he loses, that will pretty much seal his fate. As for Reid, well, he will no longer be in office and the Senate race in Nevada is a squeaker, but it s hard to imagine that if Hillary walks away with the state in her pocket, so will Cortez Masto, the Democratic poised to replace Reid.Featured image via Ethan Miller/Getty Images.

       " 'Donald Trump has basically built his life around doing nothing and taking credit for the accomplishments and work of others   and that definitely has not changed since he won the election and got into the White House. The crazy thing is, he continues to claim the successes of his predecessor, former President Barack Obama, whom Trump has repeatedly criticized and trashed in the past.The GOP has undermined Obama s soaring track record for the past eight years. They ve trashed everything Obama improved from the economy to his employment record   and now, they re more than happy to take credit for his hard work. Earlier today, White House Press Secretary Sean Spicer showed just how desperate and pathetic the White House is when he tweeted this horrible message: Great news for American workers: economy added 235,000 new jobs, unemployment rate drops to 4.7% in first report for @POTUS Trump. Trump hasn t even been in office for two full months. These numbers are NOT a reflection of his work! It s also worth nothing that those job numbers for February 2016 (237,000) are nearly identical to the ones in February 2015 (238,000). Clearly, this is Obama s doing   not Trump s. According to the Bureau of Labor Statistics, job gains have averaged 209,000 per month. Trump and his team are so delusional, they seriously think they can take credit for the job numbers in February, when they didn t even get into the White House until January 20th.Under Obama, America saw the longest consecutive job creation streak in 75 years  completely dismantling the GOP s assertion that he didn t do anything for the country and left it worse than what he started with. Despite the fact that data shows that Obama greatly improved our country, Trump has still promised the American people that he would  fix  our jobs.

The newest poll from Bloomberg Politics shows Clinton edging out Trump by 2 points with men (46 to 44) and 9 points overall (47-38).The poll was conducted from October 14-17 with responses from 1,006 likely voters.So a week after the game-changing audio tape was leaked   in which Trump admits to sexually assaulting women   men have started to turn against the Republican nominee, and for good reason.Clinton is already gaining in Republican strongholds   white, college educated women, Cuban-Americans, young Republicans, Vietnamese-Americans, and now men. Such gains have turned traditionally red states like Arizona, Georgia and Texas into reachable victories for Democrats.With Trump under-performing Romney in key swing states (and red states), Trump cannot afford to lose his key voting demographics, but the damage from the tape and the accusations of sexual assault have hurt him tremendously.Republican men have distanced themselves from Trump after the revelations were leaked, invoking their wives and daughters and granddaughters as reasons they cannot support the GOP nominee. It s not clear if the shift in male support for Clinton comes from Independent or Republican defectors, but the numbers are slowly inching Clinton s way.With less than 20 days until election day, Trump is going to have to pivot hard if he hopes of bringing back all the defectors into his camp.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - Special counsel Robert Mueller’s team is working with New York Attorney General Eric Schneiderman on its investigation into President Donald Trump’s former campaign manager Paul Manafort and his financial transactions, Politico reported on Wednesday. Citing unnamed people familiar with the matter, Politico reported Mueller’s team, which is investigating possible collusion between Trump’s campaign and Russia, and Schneiderman’s aides have shared evidence and talked frequently about a potential case in recent weeks. The cooperation “could potentially provide Mueller with additional leverage to get Manafort to cooperate in the larger investigation into Trump’s campaign, as Trump does not have pardon power over state crimes,” Politico reported. CNN reported on Tuesday that Mueller had issued subpoenas to an attorney who formerly represented Manafort and to a Manafort spokesman. Manafort’s Virginia apartment was raided by agents with the Federal Bureau of Investigation last month. The longtime political consultant and lobbyist is being investigated for possible money laundering and has been targeted as someone who might testify against former colleagues, two people familiar with Mueller’s work have said. Politico said no decision had been made on whether to file charges, and quoted one of the sources as saying “Nothing is imminent.” Mueller’s team has been looking into Manafort’s lobbying work and financial transactions, including real estate deals in New York. Manafort, who headed Republican Trump’s campaign for several months in 2016, has not been accused of any wrongdoing. Schneiderman, a Democrat, said in May that Trump’s firing of former FBI Director James Comey threatened the integrity of the agency. Trump has called Schneiderman a “lightweight.” Russia has denied any meddling in the 2016 U.S. election. Trump has denied any collusion by his campaign and has condemned the investigation as political witch hunt. ',\n",
       " 'LAS VEGAS (Reuters) - Top fundraisers for Donald Trump made pitches on Wednesday to prominent hedge fund investors to line up behind the presumptive Republican presidential nominee as he seeks to raise $1 billion for the general election campaign. The New York billionaire businessman was a topic of discussion as some 2,000 hedge fund managers, investors, lawyers and journalists gathered in Las Vegas for the SkyBridge Alternatives Conference, known as SALT, the industry’s most prominent annual meeting. Steven Mnuchin, Trump’s newly appointed national finance chairman and a private investor himself, met with some of the attending hedge fund managers and others, including oil investor T. Boone Pickens, Georgette Mosbacher and former Massachusetts Senator Scott Brown. In an onstage interview, Kenneth Griffin, the billionaire founder of powerful hedge fund firm Citadel who previously supported U.S. Senator Marco Rubio of Florida, did not address the presidential campaign. A spokesman for Griffin did not respond to a request for comment. Also speaking at the event was former New York Mayor Michael Bloomberg, who in an onstage interview, declined to endorse any presidential candidate. Earlier this year, Bloomberg flirted with an independent presidential candidacy, but decided against it for fear it would help Trump’s chances of getting elected. Some investors told Reuters they were disappointed Bloomberg did not enter the race. Trump is the last man standing in the Republican race after U.S. Senator Ted Cruz of Texas and Ohio Governor John Kasich dropped out last week. Trump, who has never held elective office, is trying to unite Republicans behind his candidacy after a primary election campaign in which his fiery rhetoric on trade, immigration and Muslims rankled party elites. A Reuters/Ipsos poll released on Wednesday showed Trump had pulled even with Clinton, his likely opponent in the Nov. 8 presidential election. David Rubenstein, co-founder of private equity powerhouse Carlyle Group, kicked off the three-day conference by asking the audience which candidate they thought would move into the White House in January after November’s election. The vast majority did not express an opinion on either Trump or Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton. Away from panel discussions on how the industry can salvage a poor start to the year - the average hedge fund is off 0.8 percent this year, according to eVestment - powerful Trump backers were working smaller venues around the Hotel Bellagio. Anthony Scaramucci, who hosts the conference and runs hedge fund investment firm Skybridge Capital, said he was reaching out to his contacts to convince them Trump would run his candidacy like an entrepreneur, something he said America needed.  “You have an opportunity now to bring an entrepreneur and a team of advisers that are entrepreneurial, out-of-the-box thinkers into Washington,” Scaramucci told Reuters. “That’s the sell to potential donors.” Scaramucci has long been a powerful Republican fundraiser who originally backed Wisconsin Governor Scott Walker in this year’s race and later Jeb Bush, the former Florida governor.  He said there would be the Trump “Entrepreneurial Avenue” versus the “Clinton cul-de sac,” a suggestion that economic growth would be stronger under the likely Republican nominee. Scaramucci added that potential donors would soon get over any fears of publicly helping Trump. “Candidate Trump has said some things that some business people think: ‘Jeez, if I’m associated with some of those things, it could be perceived negatively for my business.’ I think that will wash away in the next two months,” Scaramucci said. Among big-name Trump backers at the conference were Pickens, an oil investor and hedge fund manager who previously supported Bush’s candidacy. “Yes, I’m for Donald Trump,” he said on stage, adding Trump was smart enough to get himself help where he needed it politically and that it would be refreshing to have a businessman instead of a politician in the White House. “Donald almost always overestimates how successful he is,” Pickens said, “but nonetheless he has been out there and he does know something about what he is talking about.” (This version of the story corrects paragraph three to remove reference to Mnuchin meeting with Griffin) ',\n",
       " 'GENEVA (Reuters) - The United Nations and Red Cross on Tuesday urged the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen to re-open an aid lifeline to bring imported food and medicine into the country. It is estimated that seven million people are facing famine there. The Saudi-led coalition fighting the Houthi movement in Yemen said on Monday it would close all air, land and sea ports to the Arabian Peninsula country to stem the flow of arms from Iran. The Saudis and their allies say the Houthis get weapons from their arch-foe, Iran. Iran denies the charges and blames the conflict in Yemen on Riyadh. The U.N. Security Council is due to meet on Wednesday, at the request of Sweden, to discuss the humanitarian situation in Yemen, diplomats said in New York.  We call for all air and sea ports to remain open to ensure food, fuel and medicines can enter the country,  Jens Laerke of the U.N. Office for the Coordination for Humanitarian Affairs said in Geneva. He said humanitarian operations are currently  blocked  because air and sea ports in Yemen are closed,  The Saudi-led coalition has told the world body to  inform all commercial vessels at Hodeidah and Saleef ports to leave , Laerke said, referring to Red Sea ports controlled by the Houthis. The price of fuel jumped 60 percent  overnight  in Yemen and the price of cooking gas doubled, he said.  This is an access problem of colossal dimensions right now.  The International Committee of the Red Cross (ICRC) joined the call.  Food, medicine and other essential supplies are critical for the survival of 27 million Yemenis already weakened by a conflict now in its third year,  Robert Mardini, ICRC regional director for the Near and Middle East, said in a statement. The ICRC said that a shipment of chlorine tablets to prevent cholera did not get clearance at Yemen s northern border. It voiced fears for 50,000 vials of insulin for diabetics due to be delivered by next week, which require constant refrigeration. ICRC spokeswoman Iolanda Jaquemet said that a ship carrying 500 metric tonnes of rice, which arrived in Hodeidah port in October after a three-month trip from Pakistan, had to leave the port last week without offloading because the ship s crane had broken.  The port itself lacks adequate cranes after repeated coalition bombing.     Rupert Colville, U.N. human rights spokesman, said it would study whether the blockade amounted to  collective punishment , banned under international law, but hoped that it would be temporary. Attacks in Yemen over the past week that have killed dozens of civilians, including children, at markets and homes, he said.  These included at least nine air strikes on the Houthi-held city of Sanaa since Saturday, when a missile was fired from Yemen toward the Saudi capital of Riyadh, he said.  A cholera epidemic has caused 908,702 suspected cases and 2,194 deaths since the outbreak began in April, WHO spokeswoman Fadela Chaib said. In Berlin, German Foreign Minister Sigmar Gabriel called for increased aid to Yemen, citing alarm at the latest  U.N. report.  No one will be able to say later, particularly with respect to Yemen, that they didn t know what was happening.  ',\n",

Wu Yongning plunged to his death from a 62-storey building in central China on Nov. 8, the day he stopped posting videos of his skyscraper exploits on Weibo, China s equivalent of Twitter. A month later, his girlfriend confirmed the death of the 26-year old in a Weibo post.  Wu, who had more than 60,000 followers of his Weibo account, was looking to win a prize of 100,000 yuan ($15,110) for a filmed stunt atop Huayuan Hua Center in Changsha, capital of Hunan province, media said over the weekend.  His death was a reminder of the need for stronger supervision of livestreaming apps, the official China Daily said on Tuesday.  Some of them try to hype things up with obscene and dangerous things, and their purpose is to attract more eyeballs and make a profit,  it said in a commentary.  Tens of thousands of Chinese post videos of themselves in a bid for stardom on the livestreaming scene, whose popularity has grown rapidly, particularly in the e-commerce, social networking and gaming sectors. Wu, who used to post videos of himself scaling tall buildings with no safety equipment, hoped to use the prize to pay his mother s medical bills, the Changsha Evening News said.  It was unclear which livestreaming platform Wu intended to post on.   There should be a bottom line for livestreaming platforms, and supervision should leave no loopholes,  ran a comment in the online edition of the People s Daily.

       " 'CAIRO (Reuters) - Three policemen, one security guard and a civilian were killed and a number of other people injured in an attack by militants in Egypt s North Sinai province on Monday, the interior ministry said.  The militants attacked a security post securing a National Bank of Egypt branch in Arish, the provincial capital, with explosives and guns, a statement said.  Egypt is fighting an insurgency against militants affiliated with Islamic State in the northern part of the Sinai Peninsula where hundreds of security forces have been killed since 2013. Attacks on security forces have been common since Islamist president Mohamed Mursi was ousted in 2013 following mass protests against his rule. The militants raided the bank branch and stole an amount that had yet to be valued, the statement said. Forces were searching the area for the perpetrators and had defused some explosives.  Security sources told Reuters that three Egyptian policemen, one security guard and three civilians were killed and 22 others were injured in the attack.  Witnesses said armed militants in five cars fired on security forces near a church and the NBE branch before fleeing the scene.   The militants fired shots randomly in the street as if they were celebrating, with some of them raising their black flags (of Islamic State). They roamed the streets for about 20 minutes then disappeared,  said Alaa Lotfy, a shop owner in the area who witnessed the clashes.  At least 24 militants and six soldiers were killed on Sunday in attacks on military outposts in North Sinai. ',\n",
       " 'In response to the Department of Justice s guidelines preventing school officials from demanding that students prove their gender identity to use a restroom, Franklin Graham took to Facebook to whine and call upon Christians to die fighting transgender protections and President Obama.Graham, also known as Billy Graham s demon spawn, posted a lengthy message on his Facebook page on Sunday night asking conservative Christians to  take a bullet  for their beliefs instead of following the law. What would you take a bullet for?  Graham asked.  What are the principles and beliefs that you would not compromise under any circumstances? Even if it meant putting your life on the line? And of course, that led into a Bible story featuring Christians martyring themselves.King Nebuchadnezzar who reigned over Babylon issued a decree that everyone worship the golden image he had made. Three men who knew the one true and living God, refused to worship the king s idol their names were Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego. The king told them,  But if you do not worship, you shall be cast immediately into the midst of a burning fiery furnace.  Here is their bold reply: O Nebuchadnezzar, we have no need to answer you in this matter. If that is the case, our God whom we serve is able to deliver us from the burning fiery furnace, and He will deliver us from your hand, O king. But if not, let it be known to you, O king, that we do not serve your gods, nor will we worship the gold image which you have set up  (Daniel 3:16-18).Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego stood firm in obedience and faithfulness. They stood up for God s truth. They stood up for their faith, and they didn t waiver, even when it meant putting their very lives at risk.And finally, Graham concluded by asking Christians to martyr themselves now.I want to call on every Christian and every pastor to stand firm like these patriarchs of old and not bow to the secular, increasingly godless culture in which we live even when (not if) we re criticized, mocked, and labeled intolerant. The God of the Old Testament that delivered Shadrach, Meshach, and Abednego from their fiery execution is the same God today and He is still more than able to save. Will you stand against ungodliness? What are you willing to take a bullet for?Here s the full post via Facebook.This kind of rhetoric sounds awfully familiar, doesn t it? Oh yeah, it s what Islamic extremists tell their followers right before they strap bombs to their bodies and blow themselves up in the name of Allah. Except this time, it s an old white male  Christian  leader saying it to Christians in America, proving once again that fundamentalist Christians are exactly the same as their Islamic counterparts.Featured image YouTube',\n",

       " 'Qaryatayn, SYRIA (Reuters) - Twenty six Syrian hostages who escaped from their Islamic State captors received an emotional homecoming on Sunday in the central province of Homs, witnesses and officials said.   They were among at least 70 people abducted and taken by fleeing Islamic State militants to a secret location in the desert east of the town of al-Qaryatayn on Oct. 21 when the Syrian army and pro-government militias regained control of the town.  The others are still missing, according to local officials, who have not disclosed the identities of any of the hostages.   Al-Qaryatayn lies nearly 300 kilometers (190 miles) west of Deir al-Zor city, the current focus of the Syrian government s offensive, with Russian jets and Iran-backed militias, against Islamic State. About 200 people turned out in al-Qaryatayn on Sunday to welcome home the returning hostages, according to Reuters reporters who visited the war-scarred town during a trip organized by the Syrian authorities. Parents wept as they embraced returning sons while other relatives and local residents threw sweets and sugar in the air in celebration.   Thank God for your return,  said an elderly man as he embraced a young man. Most in the crowd declined to be interviewed.  Syrian authorities said jihadists had taken revenge after being forced out after three weeks of fighting around the outskirts of al-Qaryatayn, by slaughtering scores of the city s inhabitants. A senior local official said the hostages escaped after they got past an Iraqi jihadist militant while he took a nap and seized his gun and shot him dead. But the joy surrounding the hostages  return was still overshadowed by executions witnessed in the town in the past few weeks when militants rounded up local officials and members of the security forces, police and members of their families and executed them in broad daylight, according to officials.    We forgot our joy when thinking of the nightmare that we went through,  Found Ghosn, a local government official told Reuters TV, saying city officials had identified at least 70 out of 130 people slain during the revenge killings.

       " 'BEIRUT (Reuters) - The head of Syria s main Kurdish political party indicated on Wednesday his group favors attending a Russian-sponsored peace congress later this month, the first time the Kurds would participate in a major diplomatic push to end the war. Shahoz Hasan said his Democratic Union Party (PYD) would advocate for its decentralized model for Syria, which it says is the only way to end the six-year-old conflict that has made half of Syrians homeless and killed hundreds of thousands.  We tabled the democratic federal solution in mid-March of 2016, and without it there are no solutions but only rendering the Syrian crisis permanent,  Hasan, PYD co-chair, said in written responses to questions from Reuters. Although he did not firmly commit to attending the Nov. 18 peace conference in the Russian Black Sea city of Sochi, he said a majority among the PYD and its allies now favored going:  We are discussing it and the majority view is to attend . The PYD has emerged as one of the most powerful players in Syria since the eruption of the civil war in 2011. Its armed affiliate, the YPG, controls swathes of northern Syria where Kurdish-led local administrations have been set up. They are allied to the United States as the core of the Syrian Defence Forces (SDF) that, with U.S. air support and ground advisers, drove Islamic State from much of northern Syria and captured the militants  de facto capital Raqqa last month. The main rebel groups fighting to overthrow President Bashar al-Assad are planning to boycott the Nov. 18 peace congress in Sochi, which Moscow says will focus on a new constitution.  But attendance by the PYD could be important if it yields steps toward rapprochement between the Russian-backed government and the U.S.-backed Kurds, which between them now control most of the country. The Kurds and the government have largely avoided fighting each other during the multi-sided civil war, with both concentrating instead on fighting other enemies such as Islamic State and Arab rebels hostile to both Assad and the YPG. The PYD says it is not fighting to win independence, but to ensure any post-war constitution gives autonomy to regions. In September, its administrations held the first part of a three-phase election that will conclude in January with the establishment of a parliament. Syria s foreign minister said in September that Kurdish autonomy demands were negotiable. But Damascus recently toughened its stance, declaring on Sunday that Raqqa was under SDF  occupation  and the city would only be considered liberated once the Syrian army recovered it. Hasan said this showed Damascus was  moving away from the democratic solution  and returning to its old stance  that there is no revolutionary movement in Syria and that the pre-2011 Syria can be recreated .  This vision is counter to reality and stands against the democratic solution,  said Hasan, who was elected to his post in September, replacing Saleh Muslim. He added that solving the crisis required a three-year period of political transition. Hasan did not respond to a question of whether the PYD would seek Assad s removal from office, the core demand of the Syrian opposition. The YPG has previously said it would have  no problem with the regime  if Kurdish rights were guaranteed.   The invitation to Sochi marks the first time the Syrian Kurds have been asked to attend a major peace conference. The PYD has been left out of diplomacy in line with the wishes of Turkey, which views it as an offshoot of the Kurdistan Workers  Party that has fought a decades-long insurgency in Turkey. Hasan said  the broad lines and fundamental elements that guarantee the solution  should be agreed ahead of time, otherwise the congress would amount to  a media carnival . ',\n",
       " 'COX S BAZAR, Bangladesh (Reuters) - More than 2,600 houses have been burned down in Rohingya-majority areas of Myanmar s northwest in the last week, the government said on Saturday, in one of the deadliest bouts of violence involving the Muslim minority in decades. About 58,600 Rohingya have fled into neighbouring Bangladesh from Myanmar, according to U.N. refugee agency UNHCR, as aid workers there struggle to cope. Myanmar officials blamed the Arakan Rohingya Salvation Army (ARSA) for the burning of the homes. The group claimed responsibility for coordinated attacks on security posts last week that prompted clashes and a large army counter-offensive.  But Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh say a campaign of arson and killings by the Myanmar army is aimed at trying to force them out. The treatment of Myanmar s roughly 1.1 million Rohingya is the biggest challenge facing leader Aung San Suu Kyi, accused by Western critics of not speaking out for the Muslim minority that has long complained of persecution. Former colonial power Britain said on Saturday it hoped Suu Kyi would use her  remarkable qualities  to end the violence.  Aung San Suu Kyi is rightly regarded as one of the most inspiring figures of our age, but the treatment of the Rohingya is, alas, besmirching the reputation of Burma,  foreign minister Boris Johnson said in a statement. The clashes and army crackdown have killed nearly 400 people and more than 11,700  ethnic residents  have been evacuated from the area, the government said, referring to the non-Muslim residents. It marks a dramatic escalation of a conflict that has simmered since October, when a smaller Rohingya attack on security posts prompted a military response dogged by allegations of rights abuses.  A total of 2,625 houses from Kotankauk, Myinlut and Kyikanpyin villages and two wards in Maungtaw were burned down by the ARSA extremist terrorists,  the state-run Global New Light of Myanmar said. The group has been declared a terrorist organisation by the government.  But Human Rights Watch, which analysed satellite imagery and accounts from Rohingya fleeing to Bangladesh, said the Myanmar security forces deliberately set the fires. New satellite imagery shows the total destruction of a Muslim village, and prompts serious concerns that the level of devastation in northern Rakhine state may be far worse than originally thought,  said the group s deputy Asia director, Phil Robertson. Near the Naf river separating Myanmar and Bangladesh, new arrivals in Bangladesh carrying their belongings in sacks set up crude tents or tried to squeeze into available shelters or homes of locals.   The existing camps are near full capacity and numbers are swelling fast. In the coming days there needs to be more space,  said UNHCR regional spokeswoman Vivian Tan, adding more refugees were expected.  The Rohingya are denied citizenship in Myanmar and regarded as illegal immigrants, despite claiming roots that date back centuries. Bangladesh is also growing increasingly hostile to Rohingya, more than 400,000 of whom live in the poor South Asian country after fleeing Myanmar since the early 1990s. Jalal Ahmed, 60, who arrived in Bangladesh on Friday with a group of about 3,000 after walking from Kyikanpyin for almost a week, said he believed the Rohingya were being pushed out of Myanmar.   The military came with 200 people to the village and started fires...All the houses in my village are already destroyed. If we go back there and the army sees us, they will shoot,  he said.  Reuters could not independently verify these accounts as access for independent journalists to northern Rakhine has been restricted since security forces locked down the area in October. Speaking to soldiers, government staff and Rakhine Buddhists affected by the conflict on Friday, army chief Min Aung Hlaing said there is no  oppression or intimidation  against the Muslim minority and  everything is within the framework of the law .  The Bengali problem was a long-standing one which has become an unfinished job,  he said, using a term used by many in Myanmar to refer to the Rohingya that suggests they come from Bangladesh.  Many aid programmes running in northern Rakhine prior to the outbreak of violence, including life-saving food assistance by the World Food Programme (WFP), have been suspended since the fighting broke out.  Food security indicators and child malnutrition rates in Maungdaw were already above emergency thresholds before the violence broke out, and it is likely that they will now deteriorate even further,  said Pierre Peron, spokesman for the U.N. Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs in Myanmar. More than 80,000 children may need treatment for malnutrition in northern Rakhine and many of them reported  extreme  food insecurity, WFP said in July. In Bangladesh, Tan of UNHCR said more shelters and medical care were needed.  There s a lot of pregnant women and lactating mothers and really young children, some of them born during the flight. They all need medical attention,  she said. Among new arrivals, 22-year-old Tahara Begum gave birth to her second child in a forest on the way to Bangladesh.   It was the hardest thing I ve ever done,  she said.  ',\n",
       " 'ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Muslim leaders on Wednesday condemned U.S. President Donald Trump s recognition of Jerusalem as the capital of Israel and called on the world to respond by recognizing East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine. Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan, who hosted the summit of more than 50 Muslim countries in Istanbul, said the U.S. move meant Washington had forfeited its role as broker in efforts to end Israeli-Palestinian conflict.   From now on, it is out of the question for a biased United States to be a mediator between Israel and Palestine, that period is over,  Erdogan said at the end of the meeting of the Organization of Islamic Cooperation member states.  We need to discuss who will be a mediator from now on. This needs to be tackled in the U.N. too,  Erdogan said. A communique posted on the Turkish Foreign Ministry website said the emirs, presidents and ministers gathered in Istanbul regarded Trump s move  as an announcement of the U.S. Administration s withdrawal from its role as sponsor of peace . It described the decision as  a deliberate undermining of all peace efforts, an impetus (for) extremism and terrorism, and a threat to international peace and security . Leaders including Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas, Iran s President Hassan Rouhani and Jordan s King Abdullah, a close U.S. ally, all criticized Washington s move.  Jerusalem is and always will be the capital of Palestine,  Abbas said, adding Trump s decision was  the greatest crime  and a violation of international law. Asked about the criticism at a State Department briefing in Washington, spokeswoman Heather Nauert said that despite the  inflammatory rhetoric  from the region, Trump  is committed to this peace process.   That type of rhetoric that we heard has prevented peace in the past,  she said, urging people to  ignore some of the distortions  and focus on what Trump actually said. She said his decision did not affect the city s final borders, which were dependent upon negotiation between Israel and the Palestinians. But when asked whether East Jerusalem could similarly be recognized as the capital of a future Palestinian state, Nauert said that determination should be left to final status negotiations between Israelis and Palestinians.  We re taking a position on how we view Jerusalem,  she said.  I think it s up to the Israelis and Palestinians to decide how they want to view the borders - again final status negotiations.  Abbas told OIC leaders in Istanbul that Washington had shown it could no longer be an honest broker.   It will be unacceptable for it to have a role in the political process any longer since it is biased in favor of Israel,  he said.  This is our position and we hope you support us in this.  Jerusalem, revered by Jews, Christians and Muslims alike, is home to Islam s third holiest site and has been at the heart of the Israeli-Palestinian conflict for decades. Israel captured Arab East Jerusalem in 1967 and later annexed it in an action not recognized internationally. The communique on the Turkish ministry website and a separate  Istanbul Declaration  distributed to journalists after the meeting said the leaders called on all countries to recognize East Jerusalem as the capital of Palestine.  We invite the Trump administration to reconsider its unlawful decision that might trigger...chaos in the region, and to rescind its mistaken step,  the declaration said. Iran, locked in a regional rivalry with Saudi Arabia, said the Muslim world should overcome internal problems through dialogue so it could unite against Israel. Tehran has repeatedly called for the destruction of the Israeli state and backs several militant groups in their fight against it.   America is only seeking to secure the maximum interests of the Zionists and it has no respect for the legitimate rights of Palestinians,  Rouhani told the summit.  King Abdullah, whose country signed a peace treaty with Israel more than 20 years ago, said he rejected any attempt to alter the status quo of Jerusalem and its holy sites.  Abdullah s Hashemite dynasty is custodian of Jerusalem s Muslim sites, making Amman sensitive to any changes in the city. Not all countries were represented by heads of government. Some sent ministers and Saudi Arabia, another close ally of Washington s, sent a junior foreign minister. Summit host Turkey has warned that Trump s decision would plunge the world into  a fire with no end in sight . Erdogan described it as reward for Israeli actions including occupation, settlement construction, land seizure and  disproportionate violence and murder .  Israel is an occupying state (and) Israel is a terror state,  he told the summit.   I invite all countries supporting international law to recognize Jerusalem as the occupied capital of Palestine,  Erdogan told OIC leaders and officials. Trump s declaration has been applauded by Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, who said Washington had an irreplaceable part to play in the region. ',\n",

They often use their political positions as a weapon against anyone who doesn t adhere to their twisted version of  morality.  Along with this, though, almost always comes some kind of amazing example of hypocrisy in their ranks.These examples pop up pretty regularly, and here we have another one.Fifty-four-year-old David Narromore is a dentist in Kingsport, Tennessee. He is also the chairman of that state s Republican Party. Narromore has been up to some decidedly un-family values like behavior of late, though, and now he might be going to jail for it. In the men s restroom at a Belk s Department Store, a most disturbing incident involving Narromore happened, and a store employee contacted police. Apparently, Mr. Narromore was exposing himself to the employee, who just happened to be a loss prevention officer using the restroom in the stall next to Narromore.Narromore went well beyond the usual toe-tapping that happens in this case here, too. He decided it would be a good idea to stretch his foot into the unidentified employee s stall and start massaging the other man s foot with his own. As if that weren t bad enough, Narromore also whipped his d*ck out for the poor innocent employee as well. This is what prompted the call to the cops.The employee then kept Narromore in the store in his office until police arrived. Narromore was taken into custody   but not without a fight. He decided to resist arrest, refusing to comply with orders from police when they attempted to handcuff him. He became physically combative, and they had to tase him. When that didn t work, officers were forced to take Narromore to the ground in order to cuff him and take him away. He spent the night in a cell, right where he belonged, despite his efforts to make sure that didn t happen. After posting bail in the amount of $2,250, he was let out of the joint the next day. He is charged with resisting arrest and indecent exposure.Of course, the Tennessee GOP has relieved Narromore of his duties after this embarrassing dust-up. Tennessee GOP Communications Director Trent Watson says of the incident: Dr. Narramore is clearly going through some personal issues. We wish him well as he attempts to deal with (his) personal struggles. Ah, yes. In Republican circles, being gay is wrong, so that means that when one has a  lapse,  it s just  personal issues.  Maybe if this guy wasn t such a repressed closet case, he wouldn t be committing sex crimes in public restrooms. If you people weren t so archaic and hateful when it comes to LGBTQ people, the people in your ranks who are repressed homosexuals wouldn t wind up doing this sort of thing and continuously embarrassing your party.Maybe the  issues  here have to do with the wrong-headed, hateful, and dangerous views of the GOP when it comes to homosexuality, not the people who are gay, repress it due to said views, and wind up in the slammer over it.Then again, this guy, as a professional Republican, deserves no sympathy, as his hypocrisy is off the charts with this one. He pushes politicians and laws that harm LGBTQ people, then gets caught trolling for gay sex in a public men s room.  Family values,  indeed.Featured image via AJC.com/Kingsport City Jail',\n",
       " 'RIYADH (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson arrived in Riyadh on Saturday to attend a landmark meeting between officials from Saudi Arabia and Iraq aimed at improving relations between the two countries and countering Iran s growing regional influence. The chief U.S. diplomat flew into King Salman Air Base a little more than a week after U.S. President Donald Trump unveiled a strategy to contain Iran and compel Tehran to agree to close what he charged are flaws in the multinational 2015 deal designed to prevent Iran developing nuclear weapons. Tillerson s only official meeting on Saturday was a working dinner with Saudi Foreign Minister Adel al-Jubeir. He was stopping in Saudi Arabia on the first leg of a six-day trip that will also take him to Qatar, Pakistan, India and Switzerland. His talks in Sunni Muslim-ruled Saudi Arabia and in Qatar were expected to be dominated by the topic of Shi ite-dominated Iran s growing regional influence. Iran-backed militias have helped turn the tide of Syria s civil war in the government s favor and they have played leading roles in Iraq s battle to recapture Islamic State s self-declared  caliphate.  This week they aided Iraqi security forces in seizing the oil-rich area of the northern city of Kirkuk as part of an effort to crush a bid for independence made by the Kurdish minority. Washington and Riyadh also allege that Iran is supporting Houthi rebels in Yemen against pro-government forces that are supported by a Saudi-led military coalition backed by the United States. Yemen s grinding civil war was expected to be high on Tillerson s agenda. On Sunday Tillerson is due to attend the inaugural session of the Saudi-Iraqi Coordination Council, a body whose creation was promoted by the Trump administration to improve relations between Saudi Arabia, Iran s main regional rival, and Iraq, whose majority Shi ite-dominated government has close ties with Tehran. During his visit Tillerson is also expected to explore the possibility of renewing a push to end a diplomatic and economic boycott of Qatar by Saudi Arabia and other U.S. Arab allies, although he has conceded he is not optimistic. In an interview on Thursday with Bloomberg, Tillerson blamed Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt for the lack of progress toward ending the four-month-old crisis. Saudi Arabia and its allies have accused Qatar of supporting hardline Islamist groups and cozying up to Iran at the region s expense. Doha denies the allegations.  It s up to the leadership of the quartet when they want to engage with Qatar because Qatar has been very clear - they are ready to engage,  said Tillerson, who forged close ties to the Gulf Arab countries in his former position as CEO of Exxon Mobil. A senior UAE official said on Saturday it was up to Qatar to end the crisis ahead of a summit of the six-nation Gulf Cooperation Council in December.  The ball is in its court and it is aware of what is required of it,  Minister of State for Foreign Affairs Anwar Gargash wrote on his Twitter account. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump said on Friday he was elevating the status of the Pentagon’s U.S. Cyber Command to help spur development of cyber weapons to deter attacks and punish intruders. In a statement, Trump said the unit would be ranked at the level of Unified Combatant Command focused on cyberspace operations. Cyber Command’s elevation reflects a push to strengthen U.S. capabilities to interfere with the military programs of adversaries such as North Korea’s nuclear and missile development and Islamic State’s ability to recruit, inspire and direct attacks, three U.S. intelligence officials said this month, speaking on the condition of anonymity. Cyber Command had been subordinate to the U.S. Strategic Command, which is also responsible for military space operations, nuclear weapons and missile defense. Once elevated, Cyber Command would have the same status as U.S. Strategic Command and eight other unified commands that control U.s. military forces and are composed of personnel from multiple branches of the armed services.  The Pentagon did not specify how long the elevation process would take. Current and former officials said a leading candidate to head U.S. Cyber Command was Army Lt. Gen. William Mayville, currently director of the Pentagon’s Joint Staff. Trump also said the defense secretary was also considering separating the U.S. Cyber Command from the National Security Agency (NSA). Cyber Command’s mission is to shut down and, when ordered, counter cyber attacks. The NSA’s role is to gather intelligence and generally favors monitoring enemies’ cyber activities. Republican Senators John McCain and Lindsey Graham, both strong voices on security matters, praised the move and said it would boost the command’s abilities.  Still, McCain, chairman of the Senate Armed Services Committee, said more steps were needed to meet the nation’s cyber security challenges. “We must develop a clear policy and strategy for deterring and responding to cyber threats. We must also develop an integrated, whole-of-government approach to protect and defend the United States from cyberattacks,” he said in a statement. The new combatant command will improve U.S. capabilities to punish foreign cyberattacks and discourage attempts to disrupt critical U.S. infrastructure such as financial networks, electric grids, and medical systems. It will establish a cyber version of the nuclear doctrine of “mutual assured destruction” between the United States and the former Soviet Union, the three U.S. officials said The U.S. is more vulnerable to cyber intrusions than its most capable adversaries, including China, Russia, and North Korea, because its economy is more dependent on the internet, two of the officials said. As other nations improve their communications networks, their vulnerability will grow, they added. ',\n",

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - With Republican efforts to dismantle Obamacare in disarray, hundreds of U.S. counties are at risk of losing access to private health coverage in 2018 as insurers consider pulling out of those markets in the coming months. Republican senators failed this week to repeal and replace Obamacare, former President Barack Obama’s signature healthcare reform law, creating new uncertainty over how the program providing health benefits to 20 million Americans will be funded and managed in 2018. In response, Republican President Donald Trump on Friday again suggested that his administration would let the Obamacare program “implode.” He has weakened enforcement of the law’s requirement for individuals to buy insurance, threatened to cut off funding and sought to change plan benefits through regulations.  Anthem Inc, Cigna Corp, Health Care Service Corp and Molina Healthcare, four of the biggest health insurers selling Obamacare plans, said they are weighing whether to pull out of more markets for 2018 rather than face financial losses. They have until Sept. 27 to finalize their plans.  So far, 40 U.S. counties are expected to have no insurer offering individual coverage next year, but that number could rise by the hundreds, according to U.S. government data, Kaiser Family Foundation analysis and insurer disclosures. More than 1,300 counties, primarily in 15 states, currently have only one insurer participating in 2018. Anthem and HCSC are the last man standing in one-third of those counties and states - putting those areas in particular at risk. “Right now the number of counties at immediate risk of having no insurers in 2018 is small, but it could easily grow significantly if a couple major insurers decide to exit,” Larry Levitt, health economist at the Kaiser Family Foundation, said.  Many insurers have been waiting for an answer from Trump or lawmakers on whether they will continue to fund $8 billion in annual government subsidies. Without assurances, many insurers plan to raise rates an additional 20 percent by an Aug. 16 deadline for premium prices. Others say that the many unknowns will make the business too risky. The last-minute drama has left millions of Americans questioning whether they will have medical coverage next year. Julie Grady, a 59-year-old small business owner in Carson City, Nevada, is currently covered by Blue Cross Blue Shield of Nevada, part of Anthem, which has already decided to leave the exchanges in her county and most of the state. Carson City will have no insurer on the exchanges next year.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Grady’s pays a reduced premium of $70 per month and a deductible under $1,000 for her plan, which is part of the Affordable Care Act, commonly called Obamacare. Grady is looking at being uninsured, as she was before the law. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “I would have to go without health insurance,” she said. “I would just stay healthy, hike, eat well. I’d be in trouble if something catastrophic happened. I would lose everything.” \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Anthem, the second-largest U.S. health insurer, sells Blue Cross Blue Shield plans in 14 states. It has already decided to pull out of most individual markets in Nevada, Ohio, Indiana and Wisconsin in 2018. Earlier this week, Chief Executive Officer Joe Swedish said he was still weighing 2018 participation in its other states. \\xa0\\xa0 In states like Colorado, Georgia, Kentucky, Missouri, and Virginia, Anthem sells plans in more than 250 counties where it is the only insurer, and they could be left “bare” next year, according to government data.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Health Care Services Corp is a Blue Cross Blue Shield licensee in five states and is the only Obamacare individual insurer in more than 90 Texas counties, more than 75 Oklahoma counties, and half a dozen Illinois counties. It confirmed on Friday that it has submitted products for its five states but is still weighing next year. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “We’re working through the regulatory filing process and hope to fully participate...in 2018, however no final decisions have been made,” HCSC spokeswoman Kristen Cunningham said. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 Molina, which has more than 1 million members in Obamacare plans, and Cigna, with more than 250,000 participants, have said they need more certainty from the government to decide on 2018 participation and would weigh their decisions up until the late September deadline.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 State insurance regulators have worked hard in recent months to replace insurers who have left. In Nevada, for instance, Centene Corp and Aetna Inc entered in some counties that Anthem left after the insurance commissioner said he would favor these insurers for its Medicaid contract bids. But they are unlikely to find replacements for new dropouts in these final weeks, particularly if the Trump administration signals it won’t fund $8 billion in subsidies for out-of-pocket medical costs. \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0 “There is almost no chance they would step in to participate,” said Kurt Wrobel, a fellow at the Society of Actuaries and chief financial officer of the Geisinger Health Plan in Pennsylvania.\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0Some insurers say they will likely just raise rates and hope it works. Blue Cross Blue Shield of Michigan filed two sets of rates with the state department of insurance, one up to 32 percent higher if the fate of subsidies remains unclear.  \\xa0\\xa0\\xa0\\xa0“We don’t have any plans to pull out,” said Rick Notter, director of the individual business at BCBS Michigan. “But it would certainly help to have more certainty around what the market holds.”  ',\n",
       " 'YANGON (Reuters) - The U.S. labeling of a Myanmar army crackdown on Rohingya Muslims as  ethnic cleansing  is unhelpful and could aggravate the situation, Russia s ambassador to the southeast Asian nation said on Thursday, criticizing  excessive external intervention . Rights groups have accused the military in mostly Buddhist Myanmar of carrying out mass rape and other atrocities during a ferocious military sweep launched in late August in retaliation for attacks by Rohingya Muslim militants in Rakhine State. That drove 620,000 Rohingya refugees, many traumatized with gunshot wounds and burns, to flee to Bangladesh, joining hundreds of thousands who have sheltered there for years after previous spasms of violence in the former Burma. The military operation  amounted to  ethnic cleansing , the United States said on Wednesday, echoing an accusation first made by top U.N. officials in the early days of the humanitarian crisis.  I don t think that it will help to solve this problem,  Russian ambassador Nikolay Listopadov told Reuters in an interview in Yangon, when asked about the U.S. move.  On the contrary, it can aggravate the situation, throw more fuel,  he said in English, citing concern over how the Buddhist community in Rakhine would react to such a designation. This month, Russia and China agreed to a UN Security Council statement urging Myanmar to  ensure no further excessive use of military force  and expressing  grave concern over reports of human rights violations , but they have opposed tougher steps and further pressure on Myanmar.  We are against excessive external intervention, because it won t lead to any constructive results,  Listopadov said.  Just pressure and blaming and accusing - it simply won t work.  On a visit to Myanmar last week, U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson urged the government of Nobel Peace Prize winner Aung San Suu Kyi to lead a credible and impartial inquiry, saying those who committed abuses should be held responsible. But prospects for such an inquiry remain dim and Suu Kyi s government refused to cooperate with a mission launched by the United Nations Human Rights Council in March after a less intense bout of violence in Rakhine. The  so-called independent investigation  demanded by Tillerson was  absolutely  out of the question for Myanmar, Listopadov said.  It s absolutely not acceptable for the Myanmar side - it will never accept it...it won t work - it s counterproductive,  said Listopadov.  Independent investigation means international (investigation) - no, it s not acceptable.  Moscow s approach was for the Rakhine issue to be solved by  political means, political dialogue,  he added, without elaborating. He welcomed talks being held in Myanmar s capital of Naypyitaw between Myanmar and Bangladesh on the repatriation of Rohingya refugees, stressing it was  important to start this process.   We wish them success,  said Listopadov,  this complicated Rakhine issue can be solved mostly only by negotiations and agreements between the two sides, because they re the most involved,  he said, referring to Bangladesh and Myanmar. China wants closer ties with Myanmar s military to help protect regional peace and security, a senior Chinese general told the visiting head of the southeast Asian country s army this week. ',\n",

       " 'Wow! Republicans had a chance to stand up to the Democrats and fight for the border wall, as well as other issues that got President Trump and many Republican members of Congress elected. The swamp monsters first attempt at backing our president and his efforts to make America Great Again however, proved to be an epic failure. Meanwhile, Democrats who are the minority party in both the House and Senate are gloating over the power they still wield over our spineless leadership in the GOP Top Capitol Hill negotiators reached an agreement on a huge $1 trillion-plus spending bill that avoids a government shutdown, aides said on Sunday.The deal means virtually all the day-to-day-operations of the federal government will be funded until September.It was a victory for Trump, who got an extra $15billion to strengthen the military and another $1.5billion to enhance border security.However, he lost out on the funding he needed for the US-Mexico-border wall, a promise that was one of the cornerstones of his presidential campaign.Details of the agreement were expected to be made public Sunday night, said aides to lawmakers involved in weeks of negotiations. The House and Senate had until midnight Friday to pass a measure to avert a government shutdown.  Daily Mail White House Budget Director Mick Mulvaney said earlier in April that the shutdown fight was  the first real test of whether or not the Democrats   specifically in the Senate   are interested in negotiating, interested in compromising. The White House last week dropped its demand for immediate funding for the border wall after Democrats said it would result in a government shutdown because they would not vote for any bill that included it. The White House also dropped its threat to stop paying federal subsidies to insurance companies that offer lower-cost coverage to low-income Americans. Trump had threatened to stop paying the subsidies to force Democrats to support legislation to replace the Affordable Care Act, better known as Obamacare.Here s a look at the trillion dollar budget that was passed by Republican majority Congress and Democrat minority.  We ve highlighted budget items where Democrats and RINO s in Congress came together to vote against promises President Trump made to voters who elected him.  Once those two major stumbling blocks to a deal were removed, negotiators had just a few remaining issues to resolve over the weekend.While Republicans hold majorities in the House and Senate, the GOP needs Democratic votes in both chambers to pass the funding bill. In the closely divided Senate, the GOP has a slim majority of 52 seats in a chamber where 60 votes are required to pass the legislation. In the House, Republican leaders need help from Democrats because some conservatives will oppose any bill that increases spending.Democrats used that leverage to get concessions from the White House on the border wall and Obamacare while also getting extra money for medical research and other domestic programs. At the same time, Democrats agreed to beef up defense and border security, allowing the White House to claim at least a partial victory.   USA Today',\n",
       " 'SEOUL (Reuters) - Two U.S. B-1B heavy bombers joined large-scale combat drills over South Korea on Thursday amid warnings from North Korea that the exercises and U.S. threats have made the outbreak of war  an established fact.  The annual U.S.-South Korean  Vigilant Ace  exercises feature 230 aircraft, including some of the most advanced U.S. stealth warplanes, and come a week after North Korea tested its most powerful intercontinental ballistic missile (ICBM) to date, which it says can reach all of the United States. North Korea s foreign ministry blamed the drills and  confrontational warmongering  by U.S. officials for making war inevitable.  The remaining question now is: when will the war break out?  it said in a statement.  We do not wish for a war but shall not hide from it.  China, North Korea s neighbor and lone major ally, again urged calm and said war was not the answer, while Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov said North Korea wanted direct talks with the United States to seek guarantees on its security, something Moscow was ready to facilitate.  We hope all relevant parties can maintain calm and restraint and take steps to alleviate tensions and not provoke each other,  Chinese Foreign Ministry spokesman Geng Shuang said.  The outbreak of war is not in any side s interest. The ones that will suffer the most are ordinary people.  Russian Foreign Minister Sergei Lavrov told U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on the sidelines of a conference in Vienna that U.S. military exercises and aggressive rhetoric were causing an unacceptable escalation in tension. Lavrov said he had passed on to Tillerson Pyongyang s desire for direct talks.  We know that North Korea wants above all to talk to the United States about guarantees for its security. We are ready to support that, we are ready to take part in facilitating such negotiations,  Interfax news agency quoted Lavrov as saying. U.S. State Department spokeswoman Heather Nauert said direct talks with North Korea were  not on the table until they are willing to denuclearize.   It is something that Russia says it agrees with; it is something China has said it agrees with, and many other nations around the world as well,  she told a regular briefing. Nauert said North Korea was  not showing any interest in sitting down and having any kind of serious conversations when they continue to fire off ballistic missiles.  Another State Department spokesperson, Justin Higgins, said it was not enough for North Korea to freeze its nuclear program, and it  must be prepared to come to the table ready to chart a course to  cease and roll back  that program.    China s Vice Minister of Foreign Affairs Zheng Zeguang was to meet Matt Pottinger, the head of Asian affairs at the    White House s National Security Council, on Thursday to discuss North Korea and trade, a senior U.S. official said. Tensions have risen markedly in recent months over North Korea s development, in defiance of repeated rounds of U.N. sanctions, of nuclear-tipped missiles capable of reaching the United States. Last week s missile test prompted a U.S. warning that North Korea s leadership would be  utterly destroyed  if war were to break out. The Pentagon has mounted repeated shows of force after North Korean tests. In September, after North Korea s sixth and largest nuclear test, B-1Bs flew further north along North Korea s coast than at any time in the past 17 years. The sortie prompted Pyongyang s foreign minister to warn that U.S. bombers could be shot down even if they did not enter North Korean airspace. Yang Uk, a senior fellow at the Korea Defence and Security Forum, said B-1Bs would be key to any strike targeting major North Korean facilities.  B-1B bombers have been regularly dispatched to the Korean peninsula over the past years; however, it seems that the U.S. Air Force might have enhanced its training to better prepare for actual warfare,  he said. Both sides insist they don t want war, while saying they will act to defend themselves. U.S. national security adviser H.R. McMaster said at the weekend the possibility of war was  increasing every day.  He said Trump was prepared to take action against North Korea but was working to convince China, Russia and others to do more to press Pyongyang to get it to give up its weapons programs. U.S. Republican Senator Lindsey Graham urged the Pentagon on Sunday to start moving U.S. military dependants out of South Korea, saying conflict with North Korea was getting close. The Pentagon said it has  no intent  to move out any dependants. On Wednesday, the U.S. ambassador to the United Nations,  Nikki Haley, raised doubts about U.S. participation in the  Olympic Winter Games in South Korea in February, telling Fox News that Washington was concerned about its citizens. However, White House Press Secretary Sarah Sanders said on Thursday the United States looked forward to participating in the games and was engaged with South Korea and other nations to secure the venues. North Korea regularly threatens to destroy South Korea and the United States and says its weapons programs are necessary to counter U.S. aggression. The United States stations 28,500 troops in the South, a legacy of the 1950-53 Korean War. The rising tensions coincide with a rare visit to North Korea by United Nations political affairs chief Jeffrey Feltman, the highest-level U.N. official to visit North Korea since 2012. Some analysts and diplomats hope his visit could spark a U.N.-led effort to defuse tensions. Feltman met North Korean Foreign Minister Ri Yong Ho on Thursday, North Korea s official KCNA news agency said. ',\n",

News broke last week that there was an eighth person involved, Irakly Kaveladze, whose presence was confirmed by a lawyer for Aras Agalarov.The meeting is a story that is a little hard to keep track of so let s do a role call of the other seven attendees first   The meeting was arranged by Donald Trump Jr. as the main representative for his father with Natalia Veselnitskaya, the Russian lawyer with the dirt on Hillary. Also present was President Trump s son-in-law, Jared Kushner, and then-chair of the Trump campaign, Paul Manafort, both of whom were there at the request of Trump Jr, seemingly to make the meeting appear more serious. Then there was Rob Goldstone, a British publicist who contacted the Trumps on behalf of the Agalarovs, the Russian Oligarchs with ties to Vladimir Putin and a Trump family friend, who set up the session in the first place. Also present was Rinat Akhmetshin, a Russian-American lobbyist who, by his own admission, worked as a military counterintelligence officer for the former Soviet Union and had also bragged about how easily he could coordinate an email hacking campaign, and Anatoli Samochornov, a former State Department staffer who was there solely to translate.Which brings us to Irakly Kaveladze, a 52-year-old born in the Soviet Republic of Georgia who immigrated to the US in 1991. Also known as  Ike,  Kaveladze was the eighth person present during the meeting and this is where things get truly interesting, as Kaveladze was once the main focal point of a congressional money-laundering probe. On his personal website, Kaveladze refers to himself as the vice president of Agalarov s Moscow-based real estate company, Crocus Group. His LinkedIn profile has him living in the Russian Federation, however, public records show he is linked to New Jersey-based businesses.Kaveladze is listed in business filings as founder of the IBC Group, based at 333 Sylvan Ave. in Englewood Cliffs, in a completely empty suite with unopened mail by the door. That exact New Jersey address is also shared with several shell companies connected to Aras Agalarov, one of which is Saffron Property Management, which Agalarov reportedly used to purchase an $11 million condominium last year in Florida. The other companies that share the Sylvan Ave. address include CI Publishing, PB Consulting, Russian Art Mall and a company called RJI Properties, run by two childhood friends of Agalarov s son, Emin. For some strange reason, RJI s Instagram account links to Emin s sister s real estate profile.Another thing his own webpage and LinkedIn profile both fail to mention is Kaveladze s alleged role in laundering $1.4 billion during the mid-1990s. In November, 2000, Kaveladze was named in news stories after a report on Russian money laundering through U.S. financial institutions was issued by the General Accounting Office. According to the congressional inquiry, Kaveladze formed 2,000 corporations for Russian brokers through his company which was called International Business Creations at the time. These corporations were then used to help steer more than $1.4 billion in wire transactions through U.S. banks.The story of Donald Trump Jr. s meeting with Russian lawyers may have been compelling when the story first broke, but this is only the beginning.Featured image via Spencer Platt/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'Liberal heads explode in 5 4 3 2 1President Trump could win the White House again in 2020   which likely would send hostile political operatives and the disapproving news media into an epic meltdown. News flash: Get ready. Mr. Trump will likely win re-election, says one analyst.  President Trump did not ascend to the White House in the usual way; he broke with traditional campaign orthodoxy and tactics,  Ford O Connell, a political analyst and adjunct professor at the George Washington University Graduate School of Political Management, tells Inside the Beltway. While Trump s first six months in the White House have been marked by early stumbles, a healthy dose of palace intrigue and low approval numbers, history says Trump is in fact the odds-on favorite to win re-election in 2020, should he choose to run. Why? Because presidential incumbency has its privileges. Since 1900, 20 presidents have sought re-election. Of those, 15 won and five lost   that is, if you include Gerald Ford, who was never elected in the first place. Adds Mr. O Connell,  So how does President Trump avoid becoming the sixth president to be fired by the people in the last 120 years? Barring some unforeseen calamity or Dwayne  The Rock  Johnson becoming the Democratic presidential nominee, the fate of Trump s presidency will live and die with the state of the economy in the fall of 2020. To ensure that the electoral winds are favorable to Trump, his administration must deliver results by passing tax reform before the 2018 midterms, showing significant progress on other key campaign promises: securing America s borders, infrastructure, trade, conservative judicial appointees. He must also continue to instill in working-class voters in both the Rust Belt (Ohio, Pennsylvania, Iowa, Michigan, Wisconsin) and Sun Belt (Florida, North Carolina, Arizona) battleground states the belief that he is tirelessly fighting for them. If Trump does that, voters will forgive his impetuous ways and rehire him,  the professor concludes.For entire story: Washington Times ',\n",
       " 'Americans were stunned when they were told the police officers were allegedly told to  stand down  and allow violent Antifa and Democrat rioters to attack students who came to hear schedule speaker and gay conservative Milo Yiannopolous at Berkeley College in February. It turns out that the mayor who was accused of telling the police to stand down may have had a motive for allowing conservatives to be threatened and physically harmed. Here s the description of BAMN from their Facebook page: BAMN   Coalition to Defend Affirmative Action, Integration, and Immigrant Rights and Fight for Equality By Any Means NecessaryWait, WHAT!?

BAMN is perhaps best known, however, for a 2016 incident in which they showed up to a rally held by the white-nationalist Traditionalist Workers Party outside the California state capitol building in Sacramento. The militant group was confrontational with the white-nationalists within minutes of arrival, and ten people were stabbed and hospitalized in a bloody fight. Police have verified through videos taken by members of the group, news organizations, and bystanders, that BAMN initiated the violence. Falarco was caught on camera at the event repeatedly punching a man in the stomach and throwing him to the ground.Arreguin, a far-left liberal, made headlines in February for his tweets prior to BAMN organizing a riot to prevent right-wing political commentator Milo Yiannopoulos from speaking at the city s University of California campus. Using speech to silence marginalized communities and promote bigotry is unacceptable. Hate speech isn t welcome in our community,  Arreguin had tweeted.The mayor also referred to Yiannopoulos as a  white supremacist,  and was forced to issue an  apology. I consider much of what Mr. Yiannopoulos says to be hateful. But I regret and apologize for the white national label,  Arreguin tweeted.Hours after his tweet, supporters of President Donald Trump who hoped to listen to Yiannopoulos speak were under a violent attack. People were assaulted with pipes, a generator-powered spotlight was firebombed, and looters destroyed several businesses in the area including a Starbucks.The rioters smashed windows, spray painted violent messages all over the area   including  Kill Trump    and began committing arsons. It was estimated that the rioters caused $100,000 in damage to the MLK Student Union, and $400,000 to $500,000 in damage to the area surrounding the university.It was immediately alleged that the mayor had ordered the police to stand down and allow the violence and destruction.Arreguin denied the accusations, saying that the police strategy was ordered by the department, not him.  They did an excellent job in preventing further risk to safety,  he added.It was alleged by journalist and author Mike Cernovich, who broke the Susan Rice scandal as well as impending Syria strikes, that the FBI was investigating Arreguin role in the stand down.Civil Rights section of FBI has opened an investigation into mayor @JesseArreguin, for inciting riots and ordering to police to stand down. pic.twitter.com/uy5EbgcvSm  Mike Cernovich   (@Cernovich) February 2, 2017Last weekend Antifa showed up to shut down the free speech of Trump supporters who were rallying in Berkeley, CA and were surprised by the number of pro-Trump patriots who weren t going to sit back and allow themselves to be beaten.Watch these two stunning interviews, where police officers almost admit to this liberal reporter that they ve been told to stand down:I tell a police officer I\\'ve been seeing people get beat up all day and they haven\\'t been around. \"Okay, and?\" he says. pic.twitter.com/OuGEcvvb8R  Shane Bauer (@shane_bauer) April 15, 2017This police officer is clearly agitated that he s being asked why he s ignoring the violence:I ask a cop why they\\'ve been hanging back as a brawl is happening half a block away in Berkeley. \"I\\'m not at liberty to discuss my tactics.\" pic.twitter.com/teGEYBV1ho  Shane Bauer (@shane_bauer) April 15, 2017The last time violence erupted in Berkeley when anti-Trump terrorists attacked members of a pro-Trump rally, Americans were stunned to see police officers standing by and watching the violence unfold without making any attempt to stop it',\n",
       " 'With the 9th Circuit Court ruling against the Trump administration and in favor of Washington State, Minnesota, and by proxy everyone else that was harmed by his Muslim ban, we have the inevitable rage-fest from Trump, along with people who are spitting in his face and stomping on his pride because they agree with the courts.One of the people who probably agrees with how the courts have been ruling is Sally Yates, the acting attorney general that Trump fired because she refused to enforce the ban. Trump didn t just quietly let her go, though. He accused her of betraying her department, and implied that she d betrayed the U.S.Now, enter Eric Holder. He was Obama s attorney general before Loretta Lynch, and spearheaded Department of Justice investigations into controversial things, such as whether the police department in Ferguson, Missouri was guilty of racial profiling, among other things. Holder, of course, also seems to believe that Trump s Muslim ban was a bad idea.So he, too, is rubbing the 9th Circuit s decision in Trump s face because, surprise surprise, Yates was vindicated in her decision to refuse to enforce the Muslim ban.

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Japan s Emperor Hirohito did not veto his advisers  decision to declare war on the United States in 1941 because he feared triggering an internal conflict that would destroy his country, he said in an account dictated to an adviser. Set for auction in New York on Wednesday, the handwritten document throws light on Japan s role in World War Two, as it records events dating from the 1920s, such as Hirohito s resolve not to oppose future cabinet decisions, even if he disagreed.  He realized that if he wanted to be in power, he had to do what they wanted,  Tom Lamb, director of the books and manuscripts department at auction house Bonhams, told Reuters.  And that is an interesting fact, since, throughout the late 1930s and through the 1940s, military decisions were made, which he could not contest,  he said. The auctioneers have put an estimate of $100,000 to $150,000 on the manuscript, which consists of two browning twine-bound notebooks written in pen and pencil by Terasaki Hidenari, an interpreter and adviser to the emperor, in 1946. The memoir concludes with the emperor s statement that if he had vetoed the decision to go to war, it would have resulted in a civil conflict that would have been even worse and  Japan would have been destroyed,  the auction house said on its website. Known in Japanese as  Dokuhakuroku , or  The Emperor s Monologue , the remarks may offer insight into the role the monarch played in the war campaign. This is a topic academics say has never been fully pursued in Japan, largely due to U.S. occupation authorities  decision to retain the emperor as a symbol of a newly democratic nation.  The Americans needed Emperor Hirohito to bind the country together, which he did,  Lamb added.  The whole of Japan changed from a rather military pre-war style to a postwar economic powerhouse, and obviously the emperor was part of that.  ',\n",
       " 'Every parent s worst fear is that a teacher will abuse their child. This fear is even greater for parents like myself with special needs children that won t be able to tell us when a teacher like Amelia Stripling is hurting them. Fortunately for Sarah Patterson, the mother of a 4 year old student at Tift County Pre-K Center in Tifton, Georgia, the school has cameras and someone willing to speak up:According to Sarah Patterson, the mother of the boy, her son just turned 4 years old on Wednesday, days after Stripling casually walked around an open classroom door and shoved her knee in the boys back without warning, causing him to lurch forward and to the ground.Stripling then helped the boy up with the help of another adult before giving him a shove into the classroom.It s easy to see that Stripling was trying to get him to move into the classroom. But it s also clear that she was completely unconcerned about how rough she was and only mildly concerned that her student might have hit his head on the ground. If the whole incident had not been caught on tape and reported, Stripling would almost certainly still be working with special needs kids.Here s the video: WALB.com, South Georgia News, Weather, SportsThe United States is staring down the barrel of an educational crisis that will guarantee more scenes like the one above. Never mind the fact that there s a concerted effort underway to gut public education, stripping resources and talent and giving them to  charter schools  that waste billions with worse results; an even greater emergency is the rapid rise of autistic students and the complete failure of our school systems to prepare for them.My family is lucky. We lived first in New York City, which takes early intervention for special needs children VERY seriously (the earlier they get help, the better off they ll be). Then we moved to Northern Virginia (the very liberal part that turned the state purple) and they also take special needs education very seriously. Compare that to Southern Virginia (the inbred redneck to our hippie liberal) where they refuse to officially diagnose my clearly autistic nephew and told his mother that they can t be bothered helping him learn to tie his shoelaces so she should just get him Velcro sneakers.There s going to be a lot more of Southern Virginia than Northern Virginia in this country as millions of kids with special needs move through an educational system that doesn t know how to help them. They can barely handle what they already have and all too often resort to the kind of abuse that Stripling does. Sure, parents with money will be able to afford the expensive services their kids will need but even middle class families will unable to cope. And the working poor? Tough luck! Have fun sending your kid off to a school with a staff that s untrained, uncaring or both.Featured image via video screen capture',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump should be coming to the realization that his Muslim ban may have been just a step too far. But in case he needs help figuring it out, Democrats are ready to help teach him a lesson.According to Politico, high-ranking lawmakers on numerous committees sent a letter to DHS Secretary John Kelly on Sunday night. They demanded that he hold an  emergency  meeting to discuss Trump s unlawful executive order banning Muslims from entering the United States. As ranking members of the committees of jurisdiction for matters of immigration, border security, and admission of refugees, we write to you on an emergency basis to request a meeting to discuss the implementation and guidance concerning the Executive Order,  the congressmen wrote.The letter was reportedly signed by  House Judiciary Committee ranking member John Conyers (D-Mich.), Homeland Security ranking member Bennie Thompson (D-Miss.), Foreign Affairs Committee ranking member Eliot Engel (D-N.Y.) and Zoe Lofgren (D-Calif.), top Democrat on Judiciary s immigration panel. In their letter, the lawmakers pointed out that  only two days after the Order was signed, it is clear that it has already led to panic and disorder, not to mention protests. Lofgren intends to introduce legislation this week in an effort to fight Trump s bigoted ban. Unfortunately, Paul Ryan being the fickle fellow that he is, is now supporting Trump s order even though he denounced the idea of  religious tests  just six months ago. This means Logren s move will probably end up dead in the water.Democrats are asking Kelly to sit down with them no later than Wednesday. In addition, Senate Minority Leader Chuck Schumer and House Minority Leader Nancy Pelosi have both reached out to Kelly on their own.In the letter, the lawmakers also blasted DHS for accusations that customs officials have been denying legal counsel to detainees. Given the widespread chaos and confusion caused by the order   and the issuance of stays last evening concerning the Order by federal courts in New York, Virginia, and Massachusetts,  they wrote,  it is vital that we meet as soon as possible so that we may provide needed guidance and information to our committees and our constituents. House and Senate Democrats also intend to stage a protest in front of the Supreme Court at 6 p.m. on Monday night. The fight is only just beginning but Democrats intend to battle Trump s bigotry every step of the way. Some Dems have even said that they are  exploring all legal options, including an Amicus Brief in support of the ACLU. The letter concluded with the lawmakers telling Kelly that they  look forward to meeting with you in short order so that we can have an open and candid discussion about how the Trump administration arrived at this chaotic place, what you understand the meaning of the Executive Order to be, and what guidance you have offered to your employees and other stakeholders.

Keith Lamont Scott s wifeThe media couldn t play and re-play the video that shows distressed wife of Keith Lamont Scott demanding her husband didn t have a gun. Did anyone in the  news  room consider looking into the background of the now deceased man with a loaded, stolen gun, that was covered with his fingerprints?Finally one week later the media begins to look into the troubled back story of Keith Lamont Scott, the man killed by police during a highly publicized armed encounter in Charlotte North Carolina which led to four days of riots and social unrest.What do they find:Charlotte [ ] Records show briefly last year, Scott s wife took out a restraining order against him.The protective order was filed Oct. 5, 2015, and Rakeyia Scott voluntarily dismissed it on Oct. 16, 2015.  Conservative TreehouseAdditionally, according to WSCOTV:(6:00pm Sept 26th) [ ] The gun that Keith Scott had on him during the deadly shooting was reported stolen after a breaking and entering, police said.The breaking and entering suspect told ATF Agents that he sold the gun to Scott. The suspect is in custody.Three Days Ago: The Charlotte North Carolina police department have released Dash Camera and Body Camera footage of the Keith Scott shooting. This is the fifth video (3 eye witnesses and two police releases):The Charlotte Police also released pictures of the hand gun recovered from Keith Scott, and the ankle holster he was wearing (holster can be seen in video), along with the following statement:There have been numerous unconfirmed reports published in the media concerning this case. The Charlotte-Mecklenburg Police Department has prepared the following case update to provide factual information about the officer-involved shooting.Two plain clothes officers were sitting inside of their unmarked police vehicle preparing to serve an arrest warrant in the parking lot of The Village at College Downs, when a white SUV pulled in and parked beside of them.The officers observed the driver, later identified as Mr. Keith Lamont Scott, rolling what they believed to be a marijuana  blunt.  Officers did not consider Mr. Scott s drug activity to be a priority at the time and they resumed the warrant operation. A short time later, Officer Vinson observed Mr. Scott hold a gun up.Because of that, the officers had probable cause to arrest him for the drug violation and to further investigate Mr. Scott being in possession of the gun.Due to the combination of illegal drugs and the gun Mr. Scott had in his possession, officers decided to take enforcement action for public safety concerns. Officers departed the immediate area to outfit themselves with marked duty vests and equipment that would clearly identify them as police officers.Upon returning, the officers again witnessed Mr. Scott in possession of a gun. The officers immediately identified themselves as police officers and gave clear, loud and repeated verbal commands to drop the gun. Mr. Scott refused to follow the officers repeated verbal commands.A uniformed officer in a marked patrol vehicle arrived to assist the officers. The uniformed officer utilized his baton to attempt to breach the front passenger window in an effort to arrest Mr. Scott.Mr. Scott then exited the vehicle with the gun and backed away from the vehicle while continuing to ignore officers  repeated loud verbal commands to drop the gun. Officer Vinson perceived Mr. Scott s actions and movements as an imminent physical threat to himself and the other officers. Officer Vinson fired his issued service weapon, striking Mr. Scott. Officers immediately rendered first aid and requested Medic to respond to the scene.Homicide Unit Detectives interviewed multiple independent civilian witnesses at the scene and at police headquarters. Those witnesses confirmed that officers gave numerous loud verbal commands for Mr. Scott to drop the weapon and also confirmed that at no time did Mr. Scott comply with their commands.A lab analysis conducted of the gun crime scene investigators recovered at the scene revealed the presence of Mr. Scott s DNA and his fingerprints on the gun. It was also determined that the gun Mr. Scott possessed was loaded at the time of the encounter with the officers. The investigation also revealed that Mr. Scott was wearing an ankle holster at the time of the event.Attached are photos of the gun, ankle holster and marijuana  blunt  in Mr. Scott s possession at the time of the incident. Additionally, links to the portion of the digital mobile video recorder (dash-cam) and body worn camera footage that capture the time of the shooting are included below.The body worn camera illustrates the footage from the moment it was turned on until officers began rendering first aid to Mr. ScottThe dash-cam footage is from the time in which the officer operating the car with the dash-cam video arrives on the scene until officers began rendering first aid to Mr. Scott.

       " 'BEIJING (Reuters) - The failure of Catalonia s effort to declare independence shows that Taiwan independence is also doomed to fail as national unity is paramount for all countries, a Chinese official said on Wednesday. China takes a dim view of independence or secessionist movements around the world, while saying it adheres to a policy of non-interference in other nations  internal affairs. Beijing has said it opposes any actions to split Spain. Last month Madrid assumed direct rule over Catalonia after the Spanish prime minister sacked the region s secessionist government which had declared independence from Spain following an attempted referendum. The issue is particularly sensitive for China because of the status of self-ruled and democratic Taiwan, claimed by China as its inherent territory, but where many people would like to proclaim formal independence, a red line for Beijing. The failure of Catalonia s independence bid was a good thing, said Ma Xiaoguang, the spokesman of China s policy-making Taiwan Affairs Office.  The failure of the Catalonia referendum fully shows that protecting national sovereignty and territorial integrity is a paramount national interest for east or west,  Ma told a regular news briefing.  So Taiwan independence is doomed to failure.  Relations between Beijing and Taipei have nosedived since the island elected Tsai Ing-wen as president last year. China believes she wants formal independence for Taiwan. Tsai says she wants to maintain peace with China, but will defend Taiwan s democracy and security. China has suspended a regular dialogue mechanism with Taiwan, stepped up military drills around the island and sought to squeeze its international space by siphoning off Taiwan s remaining diplomatic allies. This week, Taiwan said its environment minister had been prevented from attending an annual U.N. climate meeting in Germany, despite credentials as a non-governmental participant, due to pressure from China. Ma said Taiwan had itself to blame for the poor state of ties and its inability to participate in events such as the climate talks.  The Taiwan side shouldn t put blame on others while they themselves are to blame, and should earnestly reflect on things,  he added. ',\n",
       " 'Donald Trump insulted the  People s House,  so Chelsea Clinton subtly ripped him a new one for it.During a recent outing to his Trump National Golf Course in Bedminster, New Jersey, Trump told members that the White House  is a real dump. The insult outraged Americans across the country. No president should talk about the White House that way. It s disrespectful, especially to the people charged with preserving it and keeping up the maintenance, which is paid for by American taxpayers.Trump is probably mad because the decor doesn t feature gold-plated walls like his penthouse at Trump Tower.But the White House has a history. It was burned by the British during the War of 1812. But we rebuilt it. Years of neglect and failure to update the historic residence resulted in the biggest overhaul during the Truman presidency. The White House was gutted and Truman was forced to take up residence across the street until the renovation was complete.Today, the White House stands as a magnificent mansion that honors the past while continually updating to remain equipped with the latest technology. Sometimes, it s hard to keep up, but the White House staff does the best they can.Trump s remark was off the cuff to people who paid to be around him. He probably thought his comment would be off the record, which means he said exactly what he meant to say.But Chelsea Clinton was not amused by Trump s insult. And she proceeded to school him on Twitter for it.Thank you to all the White House ushers, butlers, maids, chefs, florists, gardeners, plumbers, engineers & curators for all you do every day https://t.co/rjQS9HeALG  Chelsea Clinton (@ChelseaClinton) August 1, 2017This is what Trump should have said.

To him, the White House is a step down, and that is truly insulting. So much so, that he should resign and move out if he hates being there so much.Back in May, Trump bragged to Time Magazine that he s the  certain type of person  who sees the beauty of the White House. People have no idea the beauty of the White House. The real beauty of the White House,  he said.That was clearly a lie Trump told the media to make himself look good.

Lee is just the latest person of color who also happens to be a member of the Hollywood elite to criticize the all-white Oscar ballots. Jada Pinkett Smith has made similar comments. She said of the entire situation: The Academy has the right to acknowledge whomever they choose, to invite whomever they choose, and now I think that it s our responsibility to make the change. Maybe it is time that we pull back our resources and we put them back into our communities, into our programs, and we make programs for ourselves that acknowledge us in ways that we see fit, that are just as good as the so-called mainstream ones. Begging for acknowledgement or even asking for it diminishes dignity, diminishes power. And we are a dignified people and we are powerful, and let s not forget it.

       " 'Florida Senator Marco Rubio has been going after presidential rival Donald Trump with a vengeance over the past few weeks, continuously calling out the Republican front-runner in every way possible   from his lies to his spelling to his offensive and hateful rhetoric.On Friday, Rubio targeted Trump s anti-Muslim comments during an appearance on CNN s  New Day , stating that Trump needs to tone down the Islamophobia because the rhetoric a president puts forth has  life and death consequences.  Rubio, who pretty much has no hope for becoming the GOP nominee, spoke some truth when he said: I know people like it that Donald Trump says whatever he wants and whatever they feel like saying. Presidents cannot say anything they want. Presidents have to understand that their words have consequences, often life and death consequences, for real people in the real world. Because of Trump s inflammatory, foul remarks, Rubio said what any level-headed American instinctively knows: that Trump wouldn t be a  good commander-in-chief  if he can t work with America s armed service in its entirety   because many of those members are Muslims. Rubio posed this question: How are you going to face them as commander-in-chief, knowing you re going around saying all Muslims hate the United States? I don t think you re going to be able to be a good commander-in-chief. You can watch Rubio s criticism of the business mogul below:These statements from Rubio come just one day after Rubio slammed Trump during Thursday s Republican debate, stating that defending Muslims isn t about being politically correct  after Trump insisted that  Islam hates us. During the debate, Rubio made similar comments to his interview on CNN: I know that a lot of people find appeal in the things Donald says, because he says what people wish they could say. The problem is presidents can t just say anything they want. It has consequences, here and around the world. Stating that although there are dangers in the world in regards to radical Islam, it s wrong to generalize an entire religion. Rubio said: There is no doubt that radical Islam is a danger to the world. I can also tell you that if you go to any national cemetery, especially Arlington, you re going to see crescent moons there. If you go anywhere in the world, you re going to see American men and women serving us in uniform that are Muslims. Rubio s right, whether you agree with him as a presidential candidate or not   and this goes way beyond Trump s feelings about the Islamic faith. He s demonstrated the same anger and insensitivity toward Hispanics, women and many other minority groups. Trump s inflammatory, hateful rhetoric has the power and influence to divide this nation instead of unify it. He s taken the most awful aspects of the Republican party and amplified them. Just by the way his rallies have transformed into fighting arenas, Trump has already demonstrated that he approves of violence and cares very little about peace and the well-being of Americans his bigotry doesn t support. He s dangerous behind comprehension, and his brand of ignorance threatens to destroy America.Featured image via Gage Skidmore',\n",
       " 'In a meeting Trump held with two Russian officials at the behest of Russian President Vladimir Putin, Trump is said to have bragged about firing FBI Director James Comey and boasting that it eased  great pressure  on him in how he deals with Russia. Comey had been actively pursuing an investigation into the Trump campaign s involvement with Russian interference in the 2016 election that ultimately put him in office. Trump, it seems, felt that the investigation was preventing him from cozying up to Putin.The New York Times reported that they had obtained a  summary  of the meeting which documented the exchange: I just fired the head of the F.B.I. He was crazy, a real nut job,  Mr. Trump said, according to the document, which was read to the New York Times by an American official.  I faced great pressure because of Russia. That s taken off. Mr. Trump added,  I m not under investigation. Trump s overt statement that the pressure on him had been  taken off  confirms Trump did, in fact, knowingly fire Comey in order to obstruct the investigation into his Russian connections. The word  bombshell  gets thrown around a lot but  that s a bombshell.The world might never have known about this frank confession of guilt because the White House prevented U.S. reporters from attending. The only journalist in the room was a Russian government-backed photographer whom American officials said  lied  about his credentials. He has kept his mouth shut.Meanwhile, the heat on Trump actually turned up since his firing of Comey. A special counsel has been assigned to look into the matter. And then there is this, a scoop by the Washington Post:The law enforcement investigation into possible coordination between Russia and the Trump campaign has identified a current White House official as a significant person of interest, showing that the probe is reaching into the highest levels of government, according to people familiar with the matter.There is someone currently working for Trump that investigators believe either was or still is coordinating with Russia. What s more, thanks to the report by the New York Times, we know Trump knows this investigation isn t going to go his way. That s obstruction of justice wrapped in obstruction of justice topped with more obstruction of justice.Featured image via Drew Angerer/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump pressured the Mexican president to stop voicing opposition in public to his plan to have Mexico pay for a border wall, according to transcripts of phone calls published on Thursday that gave an insight into Trump’s attempts to influence foreign leaders in his first days in office. The Washington Post published texts of sometimes fraught calls with Mexico’s Enrique Pena Nieto and Australian Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull just days after the Republican took office on Jan. 20. The substance of the calls has previously been reported but the lengthy transcripts reveal Trump, whose first elected office is the presidency, trying to use a mixture of bluster, tough talk and charm as he fully enters the world of diplomacy. Trump argued with Turnbull over refugees in an acrimonious call on Jan. 28 which the new U.S. president told his counterpart was “unpleasant.” In a Jan. 27 call, Trump pressed Pena Nieto to avoid saying in public that Mexico would not fund the planned border wall. But he complimented the Mexican leader’s “beautiful words” and said he hoped Mexico would change its constitution to allow Pena Nieto to extend his stay in office. The proposed wall, aimed at preventing illegal immigration to the United States, is a bone of contention between Mexico and Washington. Pena Nieto has repeatedly rejected Trump’s promise that Mexico will end up paying billions of dollars for its construction.      Trump told the Mexican leader in the call that “if you are going to say that Mexico is not going to pay for the wall, then I do not want to meet with you guys anymore because I cannot live with that,” according to the transcript.  “You cannot say that to the press,” Trump said.     Pena Nieto had earlier scrapped a plan to hold talks with Trump in the United States due to tensions over the wall and trade. The two men have since met, holding talks at a summit of the Group of 20 nations in Germany last month.             The White House has said the U.S. government will pay for the wall initially to get the project off the ground but that Mexico will eventually reimburse it for the work.      Both the White House and Mexico’s foreign ministry did not have any immediate comment on Thursday about the release of the call transcripts. It was the latest in a series of leaks from inside Trump’s administration which have angered the president. The Republican won some sympathy over leaks from a political opponent on Thursday.  “I am alarmed at leaks of conversations between two heads of state,” Democratic U.S. Senator Brian Schatz wrote on Twitter. “It doesn’t matter what I think of this president, this is terrible.”  In the conversation with Pena Nieto, Trump said both leaders were “in a little bit of a political bind” due to Trump’s campaign pledge to build the wall and have Mexico foot the bill. “I have to have Mexico pay for the wall – I have to. I have been talking about it for a two-year period,” Trump said.                     He suggested that the two men avoid the issue of paying for the wall when asked.     “They are going to say, ‘Who is going to pay for the wall, Mr. President?’ to both of us, and we should both say, ‘We will work it out,’” Trump said. “It will work out in the formula somehow. As opposed to you saying, ‘We will not pay’ and me saying, ‘We will not pay,’” the U.S. president said.    Pena Nieto said he understood Trump’s position on how to refer to paying for the border wall and suggested seeking “a creative way to jump over this obstacle.” Toward the end of their conversation, Trump responded effusively to a comment by Pena Nieto about the Mexican leader’s wish for a constructive relationship with the United States.     “Your words are so beautiful. Those are beautiful words and I do not think I can speak that beautifully, okay?” Trump said. “I want you to be so popular that your people will call for a constitutional amendment in Mexico so that you can run again for another six years,” he said. By law, Mexican presidents can only serve one six-year term. ‘DRUG INFESTED-DEN’ In comments likely to upset voters in New Hampshire - an important early voting state in the U.S. presidential election primaries - Trump described the state as “a drug-infested den.”  “I won New Hampshire because New Hampshire is a drug-infested den,” he said, complaining that drugs from Mexico are damaging the United States. While Trump won the Republican primary there, he narrowly lost the state to Democratic rival Hillary Clinton in the general election.     New Hampshire officials from both parties lashed out at Trump, with several saying his push to repeal the Obamacare healthcare law would worsen the nation’s opioid crisis. Speaking to Australia’s Turnbull, Trump became irritated that the United States was expected to honor an agreement made by his Democratic predecessor, Barack Obama, to accept as many as 1,250 refugees held in Australian processing centers on remote Pacific islands. Trump said that would make him look bad given his campaign promises to reduce the number of refugees entering the United States, according to the transcript. “This is going to kill me. I am the world’s greatest person that does not want to let people into the country,” Trump said.        Seeking to win Trump’s support, Turnbull on Friday said Washington could honor the deal while taking as few as 100 refugees from the two offshore centers, should the rest fail to satisfy its vetting. “It has always been subject to American vetting procedures,” Turnbull told reporters in Western Australia state. “Those procedures from the Department of Homeland Security are ongoing.” The dialogue was a “frank conversation between adults”, he added. Trump told Turnbull that their conversation was the most difficult he had held that day, after speaking to Russian President Vladimir Putin and others. “I have had it. I have been making these calls all day and this is the most unpleasant call all day,” Trump said. “Putin was a pleasant call. This is ridiculous.” ',\n",

We weren t in the house two or three minutes and there was a loud bang,  Vickie Malone told The Huffington Post. When she went to the door to see what had happened, she found the family s 3-year-old dog, Opie, lying on the ground. He was kicking and gasping for air,  Malone said during the interview. She noted that there was blood coming from his head.A Wynnewood Police officer told Malone s 21-year-old daughter,  I had to shoot your dog.  According to Malone the officer told her and her 23-year-old son, Rio Youngblood, that the dog had tried to attack him through the metal fence that surrounds the family s property.In contrast, the officer later stated that he was inside the fence when the dog charged at him from around the house. He stated that the dog latched onto his leg and that he attempted to get free by kicking it twice.That story just doesn t add up. As Fox 25 reports here, the officer used a high-powered rifle, which he had to retrieve from his police vehicle, to shoot the family pet. He shot the dog three times, firing two bullets right in front of a group of terrified children.The officer went to the Malone residence to serve a warrant on someone who doesn t live there. Malone told The Huffington Post that the officer knew who lived in the home and was aware that the family had a dog. He said he was checking to see if a guy name Shon McNiel lived here and no one here has heard of the person he was talking about,  she said during an interview with Fox 25.

       " 'ISLAMABAD (Reuters) - Pakistani authorities issued a final warning on Friday to members of an Islamist party blocking a main road into the capital, raising fears of a violent clash. Hundreds of supporters of the Tehreek-e-Labaik Pakistan party have been blocking the route into Islamabad for nearly 10 days, demanding the minister of law be sacked for what they say is blasphemy.  You all are being given a last warning,  the Islamabad deputy commissioner said in the order. A court had already ordered the party to end the protest, the order added.  After this final announcement, you all are being warned to end the illegal sit-in immediately.        Tehreek-e-Labaik blames the minister, Zahid Hamid, for changes to an electoral oath that it says amount to blasphemy. The government puts the issue down to a clerical error. Pakistan s blasphemy law is a lightning rod for Islamists, especially since 2011 when the liberal governor of Punjab province, Salman Taseer, was murdered by a bodyguard for questioning it. The law mandates the death penalty for insulting Islam or the Prophet Mohammad. A spokesman for the Labaik party, Ejaz Ashrafi, said the group would not comply with the deputy commissioner s ultimatum.   We re not moving,  he told Reuters by phone from the sit-in.  Pakistan s Interior Minister Ahsan Iqbal appealed to the protesters to end the sit-in before a delegation of Chinese investors arrived in Islamabad on Monday, making a last offer to negotiate on their demands. But he added:  If some group tries to hold the state hostage, that behavior will not be tolerated.   A government official, Khalid Abbasi, said protesters on the road were carrying rods and sticks. Since they were given the warning, he said, hundreds more party workers had joined the sit-in.     The government has blocked several roads with shipping containers in an effort to corral the protesters, causing hours-long traffic jams in and around the capital. In 2007, a confrontation between authorities and supporters of radical preachers at an Islamabad mosque led to more than 100 deaths.  All resources can be used to break this sit-in,  the deputy commissioner s warning said.  ',\n",
       " 'Does anyone remember these girls?Dixie who?Just days before the release of the drug cartel thriller Sicario, actress Emily Blunt is taking more fire for saying during an interview last weekend she regrets becoming a U.S. citizen after watching the first Republican presidential debate.The star told The Hollywood Reporter,  I became an American citizen recently, and that night, we watched the Republican debate and I thought,  This was a terrible mistake. What have I done? During the interview, Blunt also described Sen. Elizabeth Warren (D-MA)15% as  pretty impressive. Tuesday, on Fox & Friends, co-host Anna Kooiman hit back hard at Blunt for those and other comments, saying,  You know what, then why don t you leave Hollywood, California, and let some American women take on the roles that you re getting? Because Americans are watching your movies and lining your pockets. Co-host Brian Kilmeade agreed, saying,  I agree with you. Longtime co-host Steve Doocy then compared Blunt s comments to those made by the country group the Dixie Chicks, who never rebounded after making critical, anti-war comments of President George W.

       " 'ROME (Reuters) - In a post-Harvey Weinstein world, logic would dictate that Silvio Berlusconi, who hosted wild parties with young women and brags about his sexual prowess, would not have a ghost of a chance at political resurrection. But logic and Italian politics have never been synonymous. On Monday, the four-time former prime minister s right-wing bloc relished a huge political victory in regional elections in Sicily. Silvio, as his die-hard adoring acolytes simply call him, was back in the driver s seat.  Berlusconi is Alive,  was the headline in La Verita, a right-wing newspaper, on Tuesday. The mainstream Corriere della Sera ran a cartoon showing Berlusconi, wrapped in a burial shroud, emerging from a tomb like Lazarus in the New Testament. The regional Sicilian ballot, in which Berlusconi s candidate, Nello Musumeci, won big, was seen as a dry run for nationwide elections due before May. As the 81-year-old media tycoon campaigned tirelessly for Musumeci, betting that a victory in Sicily would be the springboard for a national return to power of the center-right, the ex-premier s sex scandals were no issue.  Unfortunately, this is a country where if one violates rules on sexual ethics, he is admired,  said Anna Foa, a history professor who is on a team of women who write a monthly edition on women s issues of the Vatican newspaper L Osservatore Romano. Earlier this month, British Defence Secretary Michael Fallon resigned after admitting touching a radio presenter s knee repeatedly in 2002 - relatively tame behavior compared to Berlusconi s past sex scandals.  This is a country - and I am sorry to have to say this - where breaking the rules brings votes,  Foa said.  Everyone wants to be the one who breaks the rules and gets away with it, and Berlusconi did this in a sphere that people like best - the sexual sphere.   Bunga Bunga  - the term of uncertain origin that the billionaire media magnate gave to his wild parties with young women at his plush residence near Milan - is now part of the modern Italian lexicon. Partly as a result of the sex scandals, Berlusconi went through a very public divorce from his second wife, Veronica Lario, in 2014. His current partner, Francesca Pascale, is 49 years his junior. Berlusconi is due to stand trial on charges he bribed witnesses to silence them over accusations he paid for sex with young women. In an earlier, related case, he was acquitted of having sex with one when she was still 17. He denies all wrongdoing. But far from being a hindrance, commentators say that in Italian politics, scandals can help, if only because voters believe there is little left to hide.  Berlusconi is like a used car that comes with a guarantee. You know what you are going to get,  said Giovanni Orsina, professor of modern history at Rome s Luiss University.  Even a person who is 81 years old and has gone through all these issues and scandals can seem appealing..., not because of his own strength but because of the weaknesses of others.  For now, Berlusconi cannot run for office due to a 2013 tax fraud conviction. But he hopes the European Court of Human Rights overturns this ban in time for him to run next year. Even if the courts deny him the chance, he would still be calling the shots as leader of the center-right in the event of a victory at the national elections. More than 50 women have accused Hollywood mogul Harvey Weinstein of having sexually harassed or assaulted them over the past three decades. He has denied having non-consensual sex with anyone. The allegations against Weinstein have prompted many more women as well as men to share stories in the media about improper behavior by powerful men in their countries. Not so in Italy, where women have for the most part remained silent despite confidential polls showing that many were asked for sexual favors in order to keep their jobs or advance their careers.  We are still a backwards country where women who speak out about sexual abuse are accused of exaggerating,  said Michela Marzano, an Italian philosopher who teaches at Paris Descartes University.  There is an unconscious adoption of the concept of a patriarchal order and male superiority and there is very little solidarity among women.   ',\n",
       " 'Jimmy Kimmel landed a rare, on-air appearance from Donald Trump on the May 25th edition of his show, and wasted no part of the segment in grilling Trump on everything. Possibly the most interesting twist, however, came when Kimmel read a question from Bernie Sanders, who will be tonight s guest on  Jimmy Kimmel Live.  The question? Hillary Clinton backed out of an agreement to debate me in California before the June 7th primary. Are you prepared to debate the major issues facing our largest state and the country prior to the California primary? Trump, ever the attention-whore, replied with something surprisingly philanthropic: Yes, I am. How much is he going to pay me? Because if I debated him, we would have such high ratings and I think I should take that money and give it to some worthy charity. If he paid a nice sum for a charity I would love to do that. Trump later said that whatever network picked it up could donate the money to charity for this debate.The Sanders campaign wasted absolutely no time in responding to Trump on this:Game on. I look forward to debating Donald Trump in California before the June 7 primary.  Bernie Sanders (@BernieSanders) May 26, 2016This would be a truly interesting debate, especially given that primary season isn t over yet, despite all expectations that both nominations would be locked up by now. There have already been so many monkey wrenches thrown into the primaries that one would think nobody would notice this one. However, one would be very wrong   this could throw the biggest monkey wrench yet into the works, depending on how the two candidates interacted with each other and the moderators in such a setting.As of the time of this posting, there was no formal arrangement to actually hold this debate, and setting it up could be a logistical nightmare for the campaigns. That could change quickly, though, depending largely on whether the networks see any potential in it. Honestly, they d be idiotic not to want to do it. It s hard to imagine that anybody in the country wouldn t want to see these two put their arguments side-by-side in a debate format.As Bernie said,  Game on.

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - Meals on Wheels America, the umbrella organization for 5,000  providers of home-delivered meals for seniors, said on Saturday that online donations have surged since the White House released a proposed budget that could lead to a big drop in its funding. The organization, which provides advocacy services for the national network, received about $50,000 on Thursday after the budget blueprint was announced, compared with $1,000 on a typical day.  President Donald Trump’s first budget proposal includes a 17.9 percent cut for fiscal 2018 in funds for the Department of Health and Human Services, which provides most of the government support for Meals on Wheels, the organization said. The budget proposal did not say how the cut would affect the Administration for Community Living, the HHS agency that funds nutrition programs for the elderly, Meals on Wheels spokeswoman Jenny Bertolette said.  Meals on Wheels said on its website that it is difficult to imagine a scenario under which the next federal budget would not have an impact on its services. “While Meals on Wheels America and local Meals on Wheels programs are seeing an uptick in giving, it does not replace federal funding,” Bertolette told Reuters in an email. The White House referred questions about the HHS budget to the department. An HHS representative referred to a statement from Secretary Tom Price released earlier this week. “HHS is dedicated to fulfilling our department’s mission to improve the health and well-being of the American people. This budget supports that mission and will help ensure we are delivering critical services to our fellow citizens,” the statement said. Trump’s budget proposal calls for a sharp increase in military spending and a like reduction in most discretionary non-defense programs, prompting a wave of concern from Democrats and some of the president’s fellow Republicans.      Bertolette said the national Meals on Wheels association did not know whether its local members have seen a similar jump in donations. One in six seniors “struggles with hunger,” according to the organization, which provides its services free of charge for those who cannot afford to pay.  Seniors who have fresh meals delivered daily show greater improvement in health and well-being than those who get frozen meals delivered once a week or no meals at all, the organization said, citing research from Brown University and funded by AARP Inc. According to the website, Meals on Wheels America hosts a resource center on nutrition with the help of federal funding.  ',\n",
       " 'ANKARA (Reuters) - Turkish President Tayyip Erdogan on Thursday called the Iraqi Kurdish independence referendum illegitimate and said Russia and Turkey agreed that the territorial integrity of Iraq and neighboring Syria must be preserved. Erdogan spoke after face-to-face talks in Ankara with President Vladimir Putin. The Russian leader gave no opinion of the vote, saying Moscow s position had been set out by the foreign ministry which said it respected the Kurds   national striving  but supported the sovereignty, unity and territorial integrity of Iraq. Both Turkey and Russia have strong commercial ties with the semi-autonomous Kurdish region of north Iraq but Turkey - with a large Kurdish population of its own - bitterly criticized Monday s referendum, threatening economic sanctions and a military response.  The Kurdish referendum has no legitimacy in terms of the Iraqi constitution and international laws,  Erdogan said in his comments at the presidential palace.   No one has the right to throw our region in the fire. In this delicate period after the referendum, we have to prevent the Kurdish Regional Government from making bigger mistakes.  Turkey has been battling an insurgency in its mainly Kurdish southeast for more than three decades and fears the vote in northern Iraq could fuel separatism within its own borders. Both Erdogan and Putin said they would continue to work together to address the conflict in Syria, where they have supported opposing sides in the struggle between President Bashar al-Assad s government and rebels who fought to overthrow him.  The de facto conditions for ending the fratricidal war in Syria, the final destruction of terrorists and Syrians  return to a normal life have been created,  said Putin, whose support for Assad helped turn the tide of the six-year conflict in favor of the president. Putin said he and Erdogan confirmed their commitment to four  de-escalation zones  across Syria, including the northwestern province of Idlib, home to about 2 million people and largely controlled by former Nusra Front militants. Erdogan said last week that Turkish troops will deploy inside Idlib, which is on Turkey s southern border, while Russia would maintain security outside the province. Warplanes conducted a tenth consecutive day of air strikes on the Idlib area on Thursday, targeting insurgent-held towns, the Syrian Observatory for Human Rights said. Opposition rescue workers said on Wednesday that Russian and Syrian jets had killed at least 150 civilians in the air raids. Russia says it is only attacking jihadists. Russian media, citing the defense ministry, said 37 Nusra members including five field commanders were killed in a rocket attack in Idlib. The presidents said they wanted to see progress in two major projects, the TurkStream gas pipeline from Russia to Turkey and the Akkuyu nuclear power plant being built in Turkey with Russian collaboration.  We place great importance on the realization of these projects swiftly,  Erdogan said.  We have observed during out talks that there are some disruptions, we will fix them quickly.  ',\n",

Rather than live and let live, people enjoy making others miserable.What should be the defenders and upholders of justice have let same-sex spouses down in Texas when the Texas Supreme Court ruled that the Constitution does not clearly require states to extend spousal benefits to same-sex couples. This decision came Friday. The ruling was unanimous, making it clear that they do not believe in justice or marriage equality.The Texas Supreme Court interpreted the ruling of Obergefell v. Hodges narrowly, questioning whether it compels states to treat same-sex couples equally to opposite-sex couples in any context outside of marriage licensing. I guess we shouldn t expect anything better from Texas.Friday s ruling of Pidgeon v. Turner revolves around spousal benefits for government workers. Texas law prohibits same-sex couples from receiving such benefits.

Instead, the Texas Supreme Court insisted, the trial court must settle the issue itself keeping in mind that Obergefell  did not hold that states must provide the same publicly funded benefits to all married persons. I am flabbergasted. How can judges, meant to serve justice, deny justice? How can they interpret rulings and laws this way? They re bending the ruling to their will because on a personal level they probably don t like same-sex marriage.My heart goes out to all the same-sex spouses that are not receiving fair and equal spousal benefits.Featured image via Robert Daemmrich Photography Inc/Corbis/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'UMM AL HAWAYA, Qatar (Reuters) - Deep in the Qatari desert, a herd of cows stands in a vast shed, cooled by fans and jets of mist - each animal a key player in a plan to defy a trade boycott and make the kingdom self-sufficient in milk by next year. The black and white Holstein cattle are among the first members of a 14,000-strong herd that farming company Baladna is expecting to build up in coming months, its chief executive John Dore told Reuters in an interview.  We will make Qatar self-sufficient by June - that is the target,  Dore said. He conceded that raising and milking cows in temperatures nearing 50 degrees Celsius (120 Fahrenheit) in summer posed special challenges. But technology and the deep pockets of Baladna s Qatari owners were compensating for the harsh environment, said Dore, an Irishman who previously worked for Saudi Arabian dairy giant Almarai. Hundreds of cows were already hooked up to the automatic milking machines at Baladna s farm in Umm al Hawaya, about 50 km (30 miles) north of Doha, and producing milk good enough to export, he said. More than 6,000 more cows from the United States are due to arrive by February. Qatar s drive to build a dairy industry in the desert illustrates how the tiny but wealthy country, the world s biggest exporter of liquefied natural gas, is using money and technology to cope with its isolation. Saudi Arabia, the United Arab Emirates, Bahrain and Egypt cut trade and transport ties with Qatar in June, accusing it of backing terrorism, a charge which Doha denies.  The boycott disrupted Qatar s shipping routes through the Gulf. It also shut Qatar s land border with Saudi Arabia, across which many perishable goods were imported, including almost 400 tonnes of fresh milk and yoghurt a day. The boycott has forced Qatar to fly in dairy products from Turkey and Iran. But Dore said the country was determined to create its own dairy sector, largely relying on Baladna, a private company which is receiving logistical and other support from the government. The firm, which raises sheep, was considering moving into milk production before the boycott, but knew it would find it hard to compete on price with imports from Almarai, he said.  The boycott removed that competition and in the initial weeks of the diplomatic crisis, the company flew in the first 3,400 cows on state-owned airline Qatar Airways.  We were milking cows here on the 11th of July, which is barely a month after the blockade, and that by any method or means is some achievement,  Dore said. Baladna is planning two more sea shipments from the United States - each holding 3,300 animals - by February. Another consignment of 3,000 cows has been planned, but not yet ordered. By June, it says it is expecting to raise production of fresh milk and yoghurt to 500 tonnes a day, enough to meet domestic demand with 100 tonnes left over for export. Baladna has not disclosed financial details of its project, and it is not yet clear whether Qatar can produce large volumes of milk economically, let alone export some at competitive prices. But for now at least, the country s drive to reduce its dependence on imports with domestic production appears to be stimulating the economy. The manufacturing sector grew 3.2 percent from a year earlier in September, official data released last week showed. Food manufacturing jumped 23.5 percent. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON DC   This week the Senate Intelligence Committee finally gave an update on its continuing investigation into whether Russia actually had anything to do with the 2016 Election. If anyone was expecting any actual evidence to be presented, they would have been sorely disappointed, again. Still, that s not going to stop Official Washington from burning though more public money to try and prove a conspiracy theory.  The issue of collusion is still open,  said committee chairman, Richard Burr of North Carolina (R).  We have more work to do as it relates to collusion, but we re developing a clearer picture of what happened. Likewise, the committee s ranking Democrat, Senator Mark Warner of Virginia, admitted they had nothing, but implored Americans to  be on guard of the Russian. The Russian active measures did not end on Election Day 2016,  said Warner. He maintains that the US should adopt a  more aggressive  whole government  approach  to combat Russian influence on the vulnerable minds of unsuspecting Americans.However, yesterday 21WIRE revealed via Consortium News   that it was Senator Warner, along with the Obama White House, who colluded with Silicon Valley giant Facebook in 2016, with Warner making multiple trips to Palo Alto to pressure Facebook to produce some  evidence  that Warner and his colleagues could hold up as proof of  Russian Bots  using Facebook to interfere in the 2016 Election. As it turns out, this was fake news fabricated by Washington and its mainstream media partners.21WIRE editor Patrick Henningsen spoke to RT International yesterday about these developments, and how the US government is using their own fake news in order to shut down competition in the information sphere. By definition, that collusion between big government and corporations is classic fascism. Watch:.

       " 'DUBAI (Reuters) - Iran will not be bullied by the United States and will react strongly to any  wrong move  by Washington on Tehran s nuclear deal, Supreme Leader Ayatollah Ali Khamenei said on Sunday. U.S. President Donald Trump said on Thursday that Iran was violating  the spirit  of the 2015 deal under which it got sanctions relief in return for curbing its nuclear program. State television quoted Khamenei as saying Iran was standing firm  and any wrong move by the domineering regime regarding the (nuclear accord) will face the reaction of the Islamic Republic.  Washington extended some sanctions relief for Iran on Thursday under the nuclear deal with world powers, but said it had yet to decide whether to maintain the agreement.  Trump must make a decision by mid-October whether to certify that Iran is complying with the deal, known as the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action (JCPOA). If he does not, Congress has 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions.  Today, despite all the commitments and discussions in the negotiations, America s attitude toward these negotiations and their outcome is completely unjust and amounts to bullying,  Khamenei said in a speech to Iranian police academy graduates.  The Americans should know ...there will be no retreat by the Islamic Republic.  The Foreign Ministry in Tehran condemned as  continued Iranophobia  Washington s move on Thursday to impose sanctions on 11 individuals and firms, including two based in Ukraine, state news agency IRNA reported. The U.S. Treasury accused the 11 of supporting Iran s ballistic missile program or its Revolutionary Guards, or engaging in cyber attacks against the U.S. financial system. U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson said on Sunday he believed Iran was in technical compliance with the nuclear deal but had stepped up destabilizing activities in Yemen and Syria and continued to have an active ballistic missile program.  None of that, I believe, is consistent with that preamble commitment that was made by everyone  in the nuclear deal, he told CBS   Face the Nation.  Iran said last month it could abandon the nuclear agreement  within hours  if the United States imposed any new penalties, after Washington ordered unilateral sanctions over Tehran s ballistic missile tests. Iranian President Hassan Rouhani, speaking on Sunday before leaving to attend a U.N General Assembly meeting in New York, said Washington should join the countries that continued to support the nuclear deal, which he compared to a dinner party.  They can choose the right path and also enter the room where the food is served. We would not have a problem with that,  IRNA quoted Rouhani as saying.   The United States imposed unilateral sanctions, saying Tehran s ballistic missile tests violated a U.N. resolution that endorsed the nuclear deal and called on Tehran not to undertake activities related to ballistic missiles capable of delivering nuclear weapons. Iran denies its missile development breaches the resolution, saying the missiles are not designed to carry nuclear weapons. ',\n",

       " 'CAIRO (Reuters) - Egypt s President Abdel Fattah al-Sisi and Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu have met for the first time in public in what Egypt said was part of an effort to revive the Middle East peace process. Egyptian authorities said in a statement the two had met on Monday ahead of the United Nations General Assembly in New York. Sisi separately met with Palestinian President Mahmoud Abbas at his residency, where they agreed to continue working toward a two-state solution. The meeting came just days after Egypt helped broker an agreement with the Palestinian Hamas group to dissolve the administration that runs Gaza and hold talks with Abbas  Fatah movement, its Palestinian rivals . For much of the last decade, Egypt has joined Israel in enforcing a land, sea and air blockade of the Gaza Strip, a move to punish Hamas, which has ruled Gaza since a brief Palestinian civil war in 2007. Netanyahu has said in recent weeks that ties between Israel and its Arab neighbors have been improving and that cooperation exists  in various ways and (at) different levels .   Egypt was the first of a handful of Arab countries to recognize Israel under the U.S.-sponsored peace accord in 1979. But Egyptian attitudes to its neighbor remain icy due to what many Arabs see as the continued Israeli occupation of land that is meant to form a Palestinian state. In recent weeks, Egypt has hosted delegations from Fatah and Hamas to help reach an agreement between the two sides and talk about the Gaza border. But reunification a decade after their battle for control may hinge on whether complex power-sharing issues can be resolved. Under pressure from the blockade, Hamas has sought to mend ties with Egypt, which controls their one border crossing. Egypt under Sisi has been wary of ties between Hamas and the Muslim Brotherhood, which Sisi ousted from power after mass protests.

       " 'Daniel Pantaleo was caught on video using an illegal chokehold on Eric Garner, killing him in front of the entire world for the crime of selling loose cigarettes. There was a lengthy investigation, but ultimately no indictment, despite public outrage and widespread protests. Now, a new report of payroll records shows just how delighted the NYPD was with Pantaleo and his deadly actions.Ever since Pantaleo killed Garner on that New York City street, he has consistently gotten raise after raise, even while being actively investigated for Garner s death, and is now making upwards of $120,000 a year.A report from Politico reads: Pantaleo earned $119,996 in fiscal year 2016, which includes earnings between July 1, 2015 and June 30, 2016. His base pay was $78,026 and he earned $23,220 in overtime, according to a review of payroll records. He received an additional $12,853 in unspecified pay, which could include retroactive pay or bonuses.Pantaleo s earnings in 2016 represent a 35 percent increase in overtime pay, and a 14 percent overall increase from the previous fiscal year, which began shortly before Garner s death on July 17, 2014.In that 12-month period, ending June 30, 2015, Pantaleo earned $105,061, with $76,488 base pay, $17,109 in overtime and $11,673 in additional earnings, records show.In fiscal year 2014, which was completed before Garner s death and Pantaleo s subsequent reassignment, he made $99,915, which included $17,189 in overtime. An investigation into Garner s killing by the Department of Justice is ongoing and the NYPD has still not released the results of their investigation. Mayor Bill DeBlasio insists that state law prevents Pantaleo s full disciplinary file from being released. This claim prompted Governor Andrew Cuomo to call bullshit and he told DeBlasio not to blame  the state law when a judge interpreted the law otherwise and your office is now contradicting the judge. So far, this is what we do know about Pantaleo s record as one of New York s finest, according to Latest.com:  Pantaleo was involved in at least three lawsuits in which he allegedly violated a (black) citizen s civil rights. He was disciplined for a bogus  stop and frisk  incident before the NYPD banned the practice. In April he was named as a defendant with the NYPD for allegedly crashing his cruiser into another man s car and injuring the driver. So in America, when a cop kills an unarmed black man with an illegal chokehold and there is video proof, not only does he get a paid vacation, he also gets one hell of a pay raise. Something is very wrong with this picture.Featured image via Latest.com',\n",
       " 'JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel was upbeat about U.S. President Donald Trump s anticipated announcement on Friday of major steps against the international nuclear deal with Iran, but voiced doubt that the tougher tack by Washington could turn around Tehran. While the White House s distaste for the 2015 pact may be sweet to the ears of Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, his government is mindful of the limits of any unilateral U.S. action in the face of dissent from other big power signatories. Some Israeli officials quietly question whether Washington has the will to follow through, noting what they deem insufficient U.S. efforts to stem the entrenchment in next-door Syria of Iran-allied forces helping Damascus in the civil war. Trump was expected to say in a 1645 GMT speech that he will not re-certify the nuclear agreement in light of Iran s ballistic missile projects and involvement in regional trouble-spots. That would give the U.S. Congress 60 days to decide whether to reimpose sanctions on Tehran that were suspended in return for it rolling back technologies with nuclear bomb-making potential.  Netanyahu spokesmen declined to comment on the pending speech. A veteran Israeli cabinet minister from Netanyahu s Likud party sounded cheered by Trump s resolve, but appeared to note the depth of partisan rifts around the U.S. administration.   The outcome that could happen, and this is the only positive outcome we can see at this stage, is that Congress manages to come together around new, significant sanctions,  the minister, Tzachi Hanegbi, told Tel Aviv radio station 102 FM.  (That) will confront a lot of gigantic international companies which are today streaming to the Iranians ... with a dilemma of having to choose between the Iranians and trading with the world s biggest economy, which is the United States.  Netanyahu has lobbied hard against the Iran deal, delivering a speech in Congress shortly before it was signed that angered then-U.S. President Barack Obama. Addressing the U.N. General Assembly last month, Netanyahu urged world powers that negotiated the deal to  fix it or nix it.  He called specifically for cancelling a core  sunset clause  that removes caps on Iran s nuclear projects after a number of years.  Asked about the sunset clause in the radio interview, Hanegbi gave no indication Israel believed it would be reviewed. He noted the resistance that Trump s new measures faced from European powers, Russia and Iran, which has threatened to quit the nuclear deal if the U.S. imposes new sanctions against it. Iran, Hanegbi assessed,  will not yield at all - period - in other words, not just not within 60 days, but neither within 60 months or 60 years, because they really do not believe that the world will reverse course. They look rather mockingly at the United States.   But he added,  If the United States reverses course and begins a process of building delegitimation for the agreement, it could be that the world, part of the West, will join it in a process that could take time ... There is still a long way to go until the dangers of this deal pass.  Israel is believed to have the Middle East s only nuclear arsenal with about 200 warheads and sees Iran s nuclear activity as a threat to its existence. It refuses to confirm or deny that it has nuclear weapons. There has been dissent within Israel over the nuclear deal, with several Netanyahu ex-advisers grudgingly coming out in its favor. His former defense minister, Ehud Barak, told the New York Times on Wednesday:  Like many Israelis, I think the Iran deal is a bad deal. But it is a done deal.  Barak warned that any U.S. withdrawal from the agreement would not be followed by other world powers and could prompt Iran - which denies seeking nuclear weapons - to work on a bomb. Hanegbi dismissed such predictions as  nonsense .   Iran has no interest in withdrawing from the agreement (because that) would immediately unite Russia and China to the United States  against it, he told the radio station. He noted - as have U.N. nuclear inspectors - that the Iranians  have not budged a hair s breadth from their commitments under the deal . ',\n",

And now, four months later, his campaign is admitting it.In fact, as of this time, only a little over three million has actually been paid out, meaning it s possible that even the new number given by the Trump s campaign is false. That, or worse, it simply disappeared. According to his campaign, donations were pledged that were not received. But that begs the question: If $4.5 million was definitely raised, where did it go?In any case, the amount of time between the fundraiser and actually paying the money is questionable, and Trump has been called out by many people for it   including Sandra Miniutti, the vice president for Charity Navigator, a service that rates charities:In recent weeks, Trump and his campaign repeatedly declined to give new details about how much they have given away.

       " 'A large group of very diverse young adults who call themselves  The Modern Patriots videotaped themselves being kicked out of the  Grill On The Hill  bar located at Amsterdam Ave. and W. 140th St in Harlem for wearing Trump hats. 100 Percent FED UP spoke with one of the young adults who was part of the group to find out why they were kicked out. According to the young lady we spoke with, The Modern Patriots group had just finished giving a speech at the City College across the street and decided to go out together to have a drink. They looked for the nearest bar, and happened to end up across the street at the  Grill On The Hill . There were 15 people in their group; 3 females and 12 males. Some of the males had MAGA (Make America Great Again) hats on. When they entered the bar, a young woman began screaming that she was offended by their MAGA hats. Other customers in the bar joined in and started jeering at them. It was then that they were told to leave.The groups who call themselves  The Modern Patriots  can be seen in the video below chanting,  USA, USA  as they were being kicked out of the bar. A large black man in a blue shirt followed them out of the bar and approached them. He warned them as they were leaving,  It s a very sensitive time. Be careful with that.  The young patriots appeared frustrated with the treatment they received from the bar, but responded in a very respectful manner. The man wearing the blue shirt in the video asked,  Do you know where you re at?  to which one of the students who was kicked out of the bar responded, Yeah, America! We talked to one of the young female Trump supporters who was with the group when they were kicked out. She explained how the customer in the bar who was triggered by their hats followed the bouncer outside the bar, engaging them in a shouting match. The bouncer was admonishing the young adults wearing MAGA hats, while attempting to move them off the public sidewalk, when the female customer who started the issue inside the bar stepped outside and began taunting the Trump supporters. The female patriot who was part of the group explained to us what happened once they we re forced outside:  I told him [the bouncer] we have our own opinion and he responded that the people in the bar had their opinion too. That woman was screaming at our friend and he gave her the middle finger when we were already outside of the bar but she started everything like she owns the place. She started all of this and when the bouncer came outside she did as well and added fuel to fire. But the bouncer was agreeing with them and told us to relax. We did not go there to cause problems we wear our maga hats all over NYC and we rarely have issues. We felt discriminated by this bar and even now they re trying to justify why they kicked us out on their page. Most of the people we were with attend the college nearby and live in the neighborhood but they are basically telling us we don t belong here. I m not for the identity politics no matter where we go we find supporters so they can keep their segregated bar and we will keep on protecting free speech. The man in the blue shirt continues to warn the young adults who dared to wear their Trump hats into the bar,  Be careful out there. It ain t no joke. It ain t no meme. Be careful out there.  He continue to threaten them,  We don t play that shit here.  He tells them to  take that shit where you live.  to which one of the Trump supports says,  I live here!  His response is priceless:  I don t give a f**k where you live. Is the man in the blue shirt suggesting this crowd of young adults who represent just about every racial group in America, had no business being in a bar whose customer base is primarily black? What about the college across the street? Do they only allow black students to drink at their bar?https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Wa1m2N3W5tE&feature=shareThe best line in the video comes near the end of the confrontation when the man in the blue shirt says,  This ain t a democracy. Be careful with yourselves.  At which point the young patriots begin to laugh and walk away to avoid confrontation as they chant, He will not divide us! Here is a sample of some of the responses Grill On The Hill received under their post on their Facebook page, where they tried to explain why they kicked the large group of young adults supporting our President out of their bar: The popular online restaurant review service Yelp shut down the comments section on the  Grill On The Hill  after they were overwhelmed by  reviews  after the story began to circulate on social media:We took screen shots of a few of the reviews that were mostly hidden from users of the YELP review service.The first reviewer starts out by mocking the man in the blue shirt saying:  Be careful with that.  They told people who are low on melanin to go back to downtown. Racists.The second reviewer claimed YELP would not allow her to give  Grill On The Hill  ZERO stars.  She went on to say,  Anyone who lets a person political opinion interfere with them tryout to enjoy a night out is bull. You say free speech but kick people out for wearing trump hats. Shame on you. That s talking out of both sides of your mouth. Stay away. Far away. We called Grill On The Hill to speak with the owners to get their side of the story. The owners were unavailable.',\n",

       " 'The last three recipients of the highly coveted Arthur Ashe award for courage were gay: GMA host, Robin Roberts (2013), First openly gay NFL player,Michael Sam (2014), and now America s transgender darling, Bruce (Caitlyn) Jenner.  Why are we celebrating the demasculinization of America s men?  Has ESPN s sports coverage taken backseat to their obvious progressive agenda?At the 1976 summer Olympics in Montr al, Bruce Jenner won the gold medal for the men s decathlon, setting a world record with 8616 points.In July, Jenner will be honored with another award, this time for a much different  achievement.  On Monday, Time reported that at ESPN s ESPY Awards, the former world s greatest male athlete will receive the acclaimed Arthur Ashe Award for coming out as a transgender.In an interview with Diane Sawyer back in April, Jenner stated that he was a woman trapped in a man s body and had struggled with this conundrum since childhood.Jenner explained in an interview with Vanity Fair that his cover photo shoot with legendary photo-journalist Annie Leibovitz  was a good day. This shoot was about my life and who I am as a person. It s not about the fanfare, it s not about people cheering in the stadium, it s not about going down the street and everybody giving you  that a boy, Bruce,  pat on the back, O.K. This is about your life. Jenner told VF,  If I was lying on my deathbed and I had kept this secret and never ever did anything about it, I would be lying there saying,  You just blew your entire life. You never dealt with yourself,  and I don t want that to happen. The transition hasn t been entirely smooth for Jenner. He admits that he had some second thoughts about becoming a woman. In a passage from the VF interview, Jenner tells reporter Buzz Bissinger that he suffered a panic attack the day after undergoing 10-hour facial feminization surgery in March.Jenner remembers thinking,  What did I just do? What did I just do to myself? Bissinger reveals in the interview that Jenner has not removed his penis.The Ashe Award, which Jenner will be receiving alongside his family at the ESPY award show in July, is one of the most prestigious in sports. According to ESPN,  the recipients reflect the spirit of Arthur Ashe, possessing strength in the face of adversity, courage in the face of peril and the willingness to stand up for their beliefs no matter what the cost.

       " 'This week, Donald Trump disappointed the entire world by pulling out of the Paris climate deal. It was a decision that was condemned by several world leaders, and marked yet another way that Trump had ruined America s standing as a global leader. To celebrate his horrible decision, Trump organized a  Pittsburgh not Paris  rally to celebrate America s exit from the deal. There was just one major problem   Trump blew it off.The Trump campaign had hyped up this event so much, and even organized it to be located right across the street from the White House   put Donnie wasn t there. He bailed, and decided to play golf instead. So much for being a dedicated POTUS and showing his dwindling number of supporters that he appreciates them, as his approval ratings continue to plummet to historic lows.The White House Press Pool told PoliticusUSA: After an uneventful ride along highways and byways toward Sterling, Virginia, motorcade pulled up to the Trump National Golf Club at 10:42 a.m.Motorcade split off and pool is now holding in a spectacular clubhouse overlooking indoor tennis courts. If any of Trump s supporters still think Trump cared about and appreciated them, this is a pretty rude awakening. When Trump s campaign announced the rally, it certainly sounded like Trump would actually be present. However, the event invitation was a little more cryptic. It said: As you know, the President has been under siege from the mainstream media and the Democrats, especially now that he put American jobs first by withdrawing from the Paris Accord. Therefore, we are organizing a group to demonstrate our support for President Trump and his fearless leadership. Either way, these Trump supporters expected Trump to be there, and he wasn t because he was playing golf   his main hobby when he wants to avoid doing his job. Trump must know that his presidency is doomed, because blowing off a rally full of supporters when his popularity is suffering is a bold move. To make matters worse, this rally couldn t have been more convenient   it was just across the street! And yet, Trump couldn t be bothered.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla / Getty Images',\n",
       " 'For the years since the debate over the Affordable Care Act began, anti-government Republicans (is there another kind?) have been bitching about the individual mandate that required people to buy insurance.Now it s their turn to come up with an alternative, and while theirs will cover fewer people, their solution is to force everyone to buy it, regardless of whether they can afford the barely subsidized coverage.The addition, which was tacked onto the Republican healthcare bill on Monday, is somewhat different from the individual mandate in the Affordable Care Act, which says that there would be a penalty for people who lack coverage for more than 63 days. In the GOP bill, it s even worse. People would be barred from coverage at all for six months if they have a 63 day gap.Republicans added this provision after economists and health policy experts convinced them that it would be unsustainable to not force people to purchase insurance.Health policy experts across the political spectrum had warned that the initial Senate bill s failure to include some penalty for going uninsured could cause a  death spiral  in which people go without health insurance while healthy and only buy it when they become sick. In that scenario, insurance premiums shoot up for everyone as insurance markets become flooded with customers who disproportionately require expensive treatments.Source: NBC NewsThe main difference between this and the Affordable Care Act, though, is that the cost of premiums are going to be much higher. According to the Congressional Budget Office, 22 million Americans stand to lose their healthcare coverage if the GOP bill becomes law.By and large, Republicans want to do away with the Medicaid expansion, which allowed poorer people access to insurance, often without paying anything. Everyone who makes under $48,000 a year receives subsidies to help pay for insurance under the Affordable Care Act. Instead with Trumpcare, they want to offer those people a block grant, which would severely restrict medical spending. Instead of subsidies, there will be tax credits.Some who aren t receiving Medicaid or Medicare might see more affordable premiums, but that s only because the coverage will be so much less.Republicans have now chosen to take the most controversial portion of the Affordable Care Act and make it absolutely draconian. If you happen to be one of the 22 million who loses insurance, good luck getting it back.Featured image via Chip Somodevilla/Getty Images',\n",
       " 'TOKYO (Reuters) - Japanese Prime Minister Shinzo Abe s ruling coalition is on track for a big win in Sunday s general election - even though almost half the country s voters don t want him to keep his job, a media survey showed on Monday. Behind that paradox is a fizzling challenge by an upstart party led by Tokyo Governor Yuriko Koike, a divided opposition and jitters about a volatile North Korea that incline wary voters toward a safe pair of hands, political analysts said. Abe s Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) is set to win between 281 to 303 seats in the 465-member lower house, while its junior coalition partner the Komeito is on track to take 30-33 seats, the Mainichi newspaper said, based on an Oct. 13-15 survey. That would put the ruling bloc on track to maintain the two-third s  super majority  it held before the chamber was dissolved for the snap election.  That means Abe s grip on his post is all but assured when parliament convenes to elect a premier after Sunday s poll. The Mainichi survey, however, showed 47 percent of voters would prefer not to see Abe stay in his post. Abe took office nearly five years ago promising to bolster defense and boost growth with his  Abenomics  strategy. Thirty-seven percent want him to remain.  Abe is not popular, but his party is trusted by enough voters to win big if only because the new parties are untested and have not generated excitement,  said Jeffrey Kingston, director of Asian studies at Temple University Japan. An electoral system where 289 seats are from single-member districts where the candidate with a plurality of votes wins and others get no representation at all also means a split opposition benefits Abe s LDP. The rest of the chamber s seats are from proportional representation blocs. Koike s fledgling Party of Hope, which the former LDP lawmaker launched last month as a  reformist, conservative  alternative to the LDP, is likely to win between 42-54 seats. The Party of Hope absorbed a big chunk of the failed main opposition Democratic Party. But an early burst of voter enthusiasm seems to have dissipated after Koike declined to run for a lower house seat or say whom her party would back as a candidate for premier. The party s platform also shares much of Abe s hawkish security agenda, but differs by promising to freeze a planned sales tax hike and to exit nuclear power by 2030. A smaller Constitutional Democratic Party of Japan (CDPJ), formed by liberal members from the Democratic Party, was set to win between 45-49 seats, the Mainichi said - raising the possibility that it might become the leading opposition group. The CDPJ  crept up from nowhere,  Kingston said.  It is clear there are a lot of people who feel left by the wayside by Abenomics.  The Mainichi forecasts were based on responses from 73,087 voters nationwide. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. House of Representatives Democratic leader Nancy Pelosi said on Thursday her party would not support a short-term funding bill being brought up for a vote later in the day because it did not include any key Democratic priorities. Pelosi said Democrats were seeking funding for fighting opioid addiction, veterans, the children’s health program, community health centers, disaster funding and a solution for  young undocumented immigrants to the United States. Her statement suggested Republicans would have to find the votes they need to pass the bill among their own members. If a short-term funding measure is not approved by the Republican-led Congress and signed by Republican President Donald Trump, all but the most essential parts of the federal government will shut down. Pelosi told a news briefing that “Democrats are not willing to shut government down,” but she also said her members “will not leave here (for the holidays) without a ... fix” to the problem of illegal immigrants who arrived in the United States as children, who are sometimes referred to as “Dreamers.” Pelosi said the temporary spending measure before the House on Thursday was a “waste of time.”  “It has nothing about (the) opioid epidemic. There’s nothing about veterans’ funding, nothing about CHIP— CHIP — children’s health insurance, community health centers, nothing about, well, the DREAM Act, among other things,” she said. The short-term spending bill does provide some short-term help for states that are running out of money to finance the children’s health insurance program for lower-income children, but it stops short of renewing the program, which Congress allowed to expire at the end of September. Pelosi, discussing the immigration issue, said Democrats were willing to accept new funding for border security, but not for a border wall. “We’re not going to turn this country into a reign of terror of domestic enforcement and have the Dreamers pay that price,” she said. Republicans have a majority in both the House and Senate. But they will need some Democratic support to get the temporary spending bill past Senate procedural hurdles that require 60 votes, since there are only 52 Republicans in the 100-member chamber.

       " 'NEW YORK (Reuters) - U.S. Treasury Secretary Jack Lew on Tuesday said Puerto Rico’s financial crisis risks turning the commonwealth into a chaotic mess unless the U.S. Congress can enact a plan to restructure its debt. “The challenge is for Congress to act fast enough so that the unfolding crisis in Puerto Rico doesn’t cascade out of control,” Lew said during an on-stage interview at the annual Milken Institute conference in Los Angeles. The island faces $70 billion in debt overall, a staggering 45-percent poverty rate and a shrinking population. It owes another $1.9 billion on July 1 that Governor Alejandro Garcia Padilla says it cannot pay. On Monday the Government Development Bank defaulted on a $422 million debt payment while it agreed to a tentative restructuring framework with some large creditors who promised to hold back from taking legal action for 30 days. Congress is debating a bill to put the island’s finances under federal oversight and allow it to restructure debt in a bankruptcy-like process. The bill has faced criticism from conservative and liberal wings of both parties. Lew reiterated there was so far little spillover from Puerto Rico’s problems into the $3.7 trillion U.S. municipal bond market where it is a major issuer of triple-tax-free debt. “In the absence of a restructuring, what you will end up with is a chaotic unwinding which does enormous harm to millions of Americans, including veterans who served loyally in our military. That I believe is something that has more of a potential spillover risk to the municipal bond market than anything else,” Lew said. As a U.S. territory, Puerto Rico cannot file for bankruptcy protection. It is struggling to pay for basic services like police and firefighters as well as combat the spread of the  Zika virus. Lew reiterated that putting in place an independent oversight authority to work out an orderly restructuring would also ensure fairness to all stakeholders. Some investors are concerned that if all bondholders are treated the same, there is a risk of eroding well established rules governing who gets paid and when in a restructuring. “The cost of delay is that you get to a point where there is nothing to restructure. If you get to a point where the restructuring can’t work, then you either let chaos happen or you have a bailout. I believe restructuring is the alternative to a bailout,” Lew said.     ',\n",
       " '(Reuters) - Michigan Governor Rick Snyder denied Thursday that he had misled a U.S. House of Representatives committee last year over testimony on Flint’s water crisis after lawmakers asked if his testimony had been contradicted by a witness in a court hearing. The House Oversight and Government Reform Committee wrote Snyder earlier Thursday asking him about published reports that one of his aides, Harvey Hollins, testified in a court hearing last week in Michigan that he had notified Snyder of an outbreak of Legionnaires’ disease linked to the Flint water crisis in December 2015, rather than 2016 as Snyder had testified. “My testimony was truthful and I stand by it,” Snyder told the committee in a letter, adding that his office has provided tens of thousands of pages of records to the committee and would continue to cooperate fully.  Last week, prosecutors in Michigan said Dr. Eden Wells, the state’s chief medical executive who already faced lesser charges, would become the sixth current or former official to face involuntary manslaughter charges in connection with the crisis. The charges stem from more than 80 cases of Legionnaires’ disease and at least 12 deaths that were believed to be linked to the water in Flint after the city switched its source from Lake Huron to the Flint River in April 2014. Wells was among six current and former Michigan and Flint officials charged in June. The other five, including Michigan Health and Human Services Director Nick Lyon, were charged at the time with involuntary manslaughter stemming from their roles in handling the crisis. The crisis in Flint erupted in 2015 when tests found high amounts of lead in blood samples taken from children in the predominantly black city of about 100,000. The more corrosive river water caused lead to leach from pipes and into the drinking water. Lead levels in Flint’s drinking water have since fallen below levels considered dangerous by federal regulators, state officials have said. ',\n",

       " 'BAGRAM AIR BASE, Afghanistan (Reuters) - U.S. Secretary of State Rex Tillerson on Monday discussed with Afghan leaders the U.S. strategy for ending America s longest war, in a brief, unreported visit that underscored the challenge of quelling the country s insurgency. Tillerson spent almost three hours in a heavily guarded building in the main U.S. military facility in Afghanistan, most of the time in talks with President Ashraf Ghani, Chief Executive Abdullah Abdullah and other U.S. and Afghan officials. A small group of U.S. media accompanying the former ExxonMobil CEO on his first official visit to Afghanistan were prohibited for security reasons from filing dispatches, photographs and video until they returned to Qatar. While there have been no recent attacks on the airbase by Taliban insurgents, the sprawling facility north of Kabul has been regularly hit since the 2001 U.S. invasion by rockets, mortars and explosives-laden vehicles. A recent visit to Kabul by U.S. Defense Secretary Jim Mattis was greeted by a rocket attack on the city s main airport. Speaking at a brief news conference after his meeting with Ghani and Abdullah, Tillerson said he would be flying to Pakistan on Tuesday to reinforce the Trump administration s demand that Islamabad move against the Taliban and other extremists based inside its borders or face the consequences.  We have made some very specific requests of Pakistan in order for them to take action to undermine the support the Taliban receives and other terrorist organizations receive,  he said.  U.S. policy toward Islamabad  will be based upon whether they take action that we feel is necessary to move the process forward for both creating opportunity for reconciliation and peace in Afghanistan but also ensuring a stable future for Pakistan,  he continued. Tillerson said he would then travel to India to discuss a request that it expand its economic and development assistance to Afghanistan. ',\n",
       " 'The Last Word With Lawrence O Donnell is seen by some as a rather dull MSNBC talk show as compared to say, All In With Chris Hayes, or The Rachel Maddow Show. However, they often have very important guests and discussions on there, and if you missed Monday night s edition, boy did you miss a doozy.Of course, we all know that presumptive GOP presidential nominee Donald Trump spent the whole of Monday blaming President Obama for the shooting in Orlando   even going so far as to insinuate that the President secretly endorses terrorism. That is about as appalling of a piece of innuendo anyone   much less a presumptive presidential nominee  could throw at a sitting president, but it s Donald Trump so of course he did it.Well, O Donnell s Last Word panel was having none of it, and they ripped Trump a new one. This panel just happened to include Peter Wehner, who is a Republican and a former adviser to President George H.W. Bush. Here is the transcript of that part of the conversation via Media Matters:LAWRENCE O DONNELL (HOST): Donald Trump began the day today by saying what we knew he would say, that of course the massacre in Orlando is President Obama s fault. We all knew that was coming. Donald Trump was going to find some way to blame the president, but he didn t just blame the president s policies. He said the president actually is cheering for the other side. He said the president has something else in mind when it comes to fighting terrorism, meaning that the president doesn t really want to fight terrorism because he has something else in mind. Those were his words. The suggestion that the president was really working for the other side was delivered in Trump s classic imitation of Joe McCarthy, innuendo on top of innuendo.[ ]David, we knew it was going to be President Obama s fault, but the details were interestingly crafted this time.DAVID CORN: Well we don t have details as you put it, we have innuendo. And this is just a continuation of the argument that made him a conservative favorite to begin with: birtherism. That there s something phoney and furtive and secretive and creepy about President Barack Obama. He s really a secret Muslim, secret socialist, he doesn t like America, and Trump doesn t say these things explicitly. But it s clear that the implication is that he wants the terrorism to succeed or happen. That he s not interested in stopping it, and he has this sort of a secret agenda. Wink, wink, nod, nod; this is Alex Jones stuff. It s racist, and it feeds the base and the paranoia that brought Trump to where he is. And it s just   the fact that other Republicans don t come out  I mean, Peter will   but other Republicans don t come out and call him out on this in this moment of national tragedy is equally sad.PETER WEHNER: I think it s all that Donald Trump knows. This is the way the man is. He pulls these pins on these grenades and he rolls them and then it explodes and he says, geez, what happened? I think the guy has a personality disorder. I don t think he can control himself. So I think even if it s not in his interest to engage in this kind of stuff, he would do it. Beyond that I think he does it because he is the most massively ignorant person ever to run for president and he cannot discuss public policy. So everything he s done from the day that he s gone in is to set up these debates that are on the ground of appealing to the darkest impulses of the country. That is what he relishes, and he wants to be in the gutter. The trouble is he s bringing a lot of people down there with him.Thank you, Peter Wehner, for not being one of those crazy GOPers who puts party before country and supports Trump despite the fact that an incompetent, racist jackass like that with his finger on the button would absolutely catastrophic for both the nation and world. Hopefully, as we roll closer to November, more republicans will realize their mistake and un-endorse Donald Trump.Watch the exchange below, again via Media Matters:Featured image via Joe Raedle/Getty Images',\n",

       " 'Donald Trump is fuming over the size of his little inauguration last weekend. Not only did his inauguration have embarrassingly low attendance numbers when compared to Barack Obama s previous inaugurations, but it was also completely outnumbered by the Women s March, which was a protest AGAINST him!Trump has tried to make his inauguration look less pathetic by having his team spew lies, despite the fact that photographic evidence clearly shows that almost no one went to see him get sworn in as the 45th President of the United States. While Trump continues to soothe his monstrous ego on Twitter, his political opponents are having the time of their lives mocking him   and what Democratic Senator Jeff Merkley just did was the perfect way to troll someone like Trump.At the confirmation hearing for Rep. Mike Mulvaney (R-SC), Trump s pick for director of the Office of Management and Budget, Merkley forced Mulvaney to humiliate Trump in front of everyone by showing side by side photos of Trump s inauguration and Obama s 2009 inauguration. To make things even worse, Merkley asked Mulvaney to publicly state which inauguration crowd was bigger.Faced with the evidence and a room full of peers, Mulvaney was forced to admit what Trump and his team wouldn t: that Obama s inauguration crowd was bigger. Merkley then tied it all together, making sure to state his point in mocking Trump. He said: The reason I m raising this is because budgets often contain varied deceptions. You and I talked in my office about the  magic asterisk.  This is an example of something where the president s team, on something very simple and straightforward, wants to embrace a fantasy rather than a reality. You can watch this beautiful moment below:Later, Merkley made sure Mulvaney got the point by calling on him to give actual budgets instead of the  alternative facts  Trump s team has become well known for.This was absolutely brilliant, and we need more senators calling Trump and his team out for their lies.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - U.S. Republican congressional leaders have refused Democrats’ calls for a special prosecutor or select committee to investigate possible links between President Donald Trump’s campaign and Russia, saying investigations by congressional committees are sufficient. U.S. intelligence agencies said in January that Russian President Vladimir Putin had ordered hacks of the Democratic National Committee’s and Hillary Clinton’s campaign chairman’s computers to influence the election on Trump’s behalf. Russia has denied this. Three U.S. agencies - the CIA, National Security Agency and Federal Bureau of Investigation - as well as the Justice Department, launched investigations into the matter under Democratic President Barack Obama. In addition, here are some of the ways that congressional committees are looking into the matter: HOUSE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE - The House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence began its investigation of potential Russian influence on the 2016 presidential race before Trump took office on Jan. 20. The panel’s chairman, Republican Representative Devin Nunes, played a leading role in Trump’s transition, which prompted some critics to question whether he was too close to the Republican president to conduct a fair investigation. Some of Nunes’ statements contributed to their concerns, including his confirmation that he had spoken to journalists at the White House’s request to dispute reports that Trump’s campaign had contact with Russia.  Nunes has also said he does not want the investigation to turn into a “witch hunt” like the 1950s McCarthy congressional hearings into some Americans’ alleged links with communism. The committee members had to push for full access to information collected by the CIA, FBI and other agencies, but more recently they have said their access has improved. The panel will hold its first public hearing on the matter on March 20. FBI director James Comey and the leaders or former leaders of most of the major U.S. intelligence agencies have been invited to testify. Representative Adam Schiff, the top Democrat on the committee, said he does not know yet whether the panel is capable of conducting a credible investigation. SENATE INTELLIGENCE COMMITTEE - The U.S. Senate Select Committee on Intelligence is conducting its own investigation. Also started before Trump took office, it is considered the most robust congressional action. Its chairman, Richard Burr, was re-elected in November in the Republican sweep that carried Trump into office and preserved Republican control of Congress. Although he was a Trump supporter during the campaign, he is not as closely linked with the president as Nunes is. But he also made calls to reporters as the White House tried to dispute allegations about campaign contacts with Russia. Senator Mark Warner, the committee’s Democratic vice chairman, said he had “grave concerns” about the independence of the committee’s probe after the report that Burr had helped the White House dispute the stories. Burr and Warner have expressed fewer concerns than members of the House committee about the amount of information that intelligence agencies have provided to them.         The Senate intelligence committee will hold an open hearing on Russian efforts to influence campaigns more generally, on March 30. The witness list includes experts, not current Trump administration or intelligence community officials. SENATE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE - Republican Senator Lindsey Graham, chairman of the panel’s subcommittee on crime and terrorism, and Sheldon Whitehouse, its ranking Democrat, announced that they, too, would investigate Russian attempts to influence the election. They also have asked the FBI and the Justice Department to produce any information that supports Trump’s unsubstantiated claim that his predecessor wiretapped him during the 2016 campaign. The full Judiciary Committee is also investigating. Its chairman, Chuck Grassley, and top Democrat, Dianne Feinstein, have had officials brief panel members. Grassley and Feinstein also sent a joint letter to Comey asking for a briefing and transcripts and documents of calls between Michael Flynn, Trump’s former national security adviser, and Russian Ambassador Sergei Kislyak. HOUSE JUDICIARY COMMITTEE - Committee Democrats tried to force the committee to ask the Department of Justice to produce records of its investigation into whether Trump or his campaign had ties to Russia, but panel Republicans blocked the effort. The committee’s chairman, Representative Bob Goodlatte, said instead that he would urge the government to continue its investigation. However, Goodlatte said he had asked the Justice Department to brief the committee, and had not had a response. HOUSE OVERSIGHT COMMITTEE - Jason Chaffetz, the committee’s Republican chairman, has resisted calls to investigate the Trump administration. After Michael Flynn resigned as Trump’s national security adviser because of his calls to Russia’s ambassador, Chaffetz said his panel would not look into the issue. He has, however, signed letters seeking related information, and he was among the first lawmakers to call for Attorney General Jeff Sessions to recuse himself from Russia-related investigations because of his contacts with Kislyak.

       " 'UNITED NATIONS (Reuters) - The new U.S. ambassador to the United Nations, Nikki Haley, pledged on Friday to overhaul the world body and warned U.S. allies that if they do not support Washington, then she is “taking names” and will respond. Haley made brief remarks to reporters as she arrived at the world body’s headquarters in New York to present her credentials to U.N. Secretary-General Antonio Guterres. “Our goal with the administration is to show value at the U.N. and the way that we’ll show value is to show our strength, show our voice, have the backs of our allies and make sure that our allies have our back as well,” Haley said. “For those that don’t have our back, we’re taking names, we will make points to respond to that accordingly,” added Republican President Donald Trump’s U.N. envoy.  Haley, who was South Carolina’s Republican governor when Trump picked her for the post, has little foreign policy and no U.S. federal government experience. French U.N. Ambassador Francois Delattre and British U.N. Ambassador Matthew Rycroft said they looked forward to working with Haley. The United States, Britain and France, along with Russia and China, are permanent veto-wielding members of the U.N. Security Council.  After her meeting with Guterres, a U.S. official said they had “a good and productive conversation about ways they can work together to reform the U.N.” Haley told reporters, “Everything that’s working, we’re going to make it better, everything that’s not working we’re going to try and fix, and anything that seems to be obsolete and not necessary we’re going to do away with.”  According to a draft executive order published by The Daily Beast, Trump wants a committee - including his secretary of state, attorney general and director of national intelligence -to carry out a one-year review of U.S. funding to international organizations with the aim of almost halving voluntary funding. A senior U.S. administration official said on Friday that no such executive order was “expected at this time.” The United States is the largest contributor to the United Nations, paying 22 percent of the $5.4 billion core U.N. budget and 28 percent of the $7.9 billion U.N. peacekeeping budget. These are assessed contributions - agreed by the U.N. General Assembly - and not voluntary payments.  U.N. agencies, such as the U.N. Development Programme, the children’s agency UNICEF, the World Food Programme and the U.N. Population Fund, are funded voluntarily. Last year, Trump took to Twitter to disparage the 193-member world body after the United States abstained in a Dec. 23 U.N. Security Council vote, allowing the adoption of a resolution demanding an end to settlement building by U.S. ally Israel. Trump, who had called on President Barack Obama’s administration to veto the resolution, warned that “things will be different” at the United Nations after he took office on Jan. 20. ',\n",
       " 'JERUSALEM (Reuters) - Israel shot down a Syrian spy drone over the Golan Heights on Saturday, the Israeli military said. The drone was downed with a Patriot interceptor missile over the Golan demilitarized zone that has separated Israeli and Syrian forces since the ceasefire deal that followed their 1973 war. The military initially told Reuters the UAV was Russian-manufactured but offered no evidence. A military source later said it was unclear whether the UAV was indeed Russian-made.   It was a reconnaissance UAV (unmanned aerial vehicle) and not an attack UAV and we are checking whether there is any connection to Iran and Hezbollah,  military spokesman, Lieutenant-Colonel Jonathan Conricus, told Reuters.  Israeli Defense Minister Avigdor Lieberman said Israel viewed the incident gravely and would respond to any provocation.   We hold the Syrian regime responsible for any firing or breach of sovereignty and call on it to hold back all players active in its territory,  Lieberman said in a statement. Russia intervened in the civil war on behalf of Syrian President Bashar al-Assad in 2015, joining a de-facto alliance with Iranian forces, Lebanese Hezbollah and other Shi ite Muslim militias helping Damascus beat back Islamic State and other Sunni Muslim insurgent groups. Israel fears an eventual Assad victory could leave Iran with a permanent garrison in Syria, extending a threat posed from neighboring Lebanon by the Iranian-backed Hezbollah and has been lobbying Russia and the United States for reassurances that Iranian and Hezbollah forces will not be allowed to deploy near its border or set up bases within Syria.   We will not allow the Shi ite axis to establish Syria as its forefront base,  Lieberman said. The Golan, which Israel captured from Syria in the 1967 conflict, has seen spillover violence from the Syrian civil war. Israel has at times fired to foil what it deemed deliberate cross-border attacks and has struck suspected Hezbollah arms shipments around 100 times in Syria during the civil war. For its part, Russia has set up a military hotline to prevent warplanes or anti-aircraft units clashing accidentally over Syria. ',\n",
       " 'ISTANBUL (Reuters) - Turkey issued arrest warrants for 63 people, including former National Intelligence Agency (MIT) personnel, over alleged links to the U.S.-based cleric accused of orchestrating last year s attempted coup, Anadolu agency reported on Tuesday. The police operation was launched in 21 provinces across Turkey, the state-run news agency reported. Ankara says cleric Fethullah Gulen, who has lived in the United States since 1999, was behind the abortive putsch in July 2016. Gulen has denied involvement. More than 50,000 people have been jailed pending trial for alleged ties to Gulen s movement and some 150,000 people have been sacked or suspended from jobs in the public and private sectors for the same reason. Some of Turkey s Western allies and rights groups have expressed concern about the crackdown and suspect the government has used the coup as a pretext to quash dissent. The government says the purges are necessary due to the gravity of the threats it has faced since the failed putsch, in which more than 240 people were killed. ',\n",
       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - The Obama administration released $65.8 million on Thursday to help communities that are struggling from the decline of the coal industry and bankruptcies of major producers of the fuel. The funds announced by the federal Appalachian Regional Commission and the Economic Development Administration will support projects that help coal-dependent communities in places like West Virginia and Kentucky diversify their economies, retrain the workforce and attract new investment. The funds are coming through the Obama administration’s Partnerships for Opportunity and Workforce and Economic Revitalization Initiative, which helps coal-reliant regions cope with market forces, air pollution regulations and other factors.   “Many communities across Appalachia – from coal mines to Main Streets – are being impacted as the world changes the way it produces and consumes electricity,” said ARC Chairman Earl Gohl. The grant comes the day after Peabody Energy Corp, the largest U.S. coal producer, said it might have to seek bankruptcy protection. Peabody would become the latest in a line of major coal miners, including Arch Coal Inc, to file for bankruptcy as demand for coal plummets both domestically and in global markets like China and amid competition from natural gas.  The plight of coal communities, particularly in the Appalachian region of the eastern United States, has gained importance in the 2016 presidential campaign, where economic frustration of white working-class voters has become a major theme.  Last week, Democratic front-runner Hillary Clinton triggered critical comments from Republican lawmakers in Kentucky when she told a CNN town hall meeting: “We’re going to put a lot of coal miners and coal companies out of business” when explaining her $30 billion economic transition plan for coal-dependent regions. Her plan expands on Obama’s broader POWER+ Plan, a set of investments in coal-dependent communities outlined in his 2017 budget.  Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell of Kentucky, a Republican, called Clinton’s comments callous and said “it underlines the need to stand up for hard-working, middle-class coal families.” Clinton campaign spokesman Brian Fallon said McConnell and other critics “twisted Clinton’s words to suggest she showed a disregard for coal workers and their livelihoods.” Meanwhile, New York real estate mogul Donald Trump, the Republican front-runner, said at a recent campaign stop in Ohio: “We have to protect your coal industry which is being decimated” by the Obama administration’s environmental regulations.

       " 'WASHINGTON (Reuters) - President Donald Trump’s national security adviser, Michael Flynn, resigned late on Monday after revelations that he had discussed U.S. sanctions on Russia with the Russian ambassador to the United States before Trump took office and misled Vice President Mike Pence about the conversations. Flynn’s resignation came hours after it was reported that the Justice Department had warned the White House weeks ago that Flynn could be vulnerable to blackmail for contacts with Russian ambassador Sergey Kislyak before Trump took power on Jan. 20. Flynn’s departure was a sobering development in Trump’s young presidency, a 24-day period during which his White House has been repeatedly distracted by miscues and internal dramas. The departure could slow Trump’s bid to warm up relations with Russian President Vladimir Putin. Flynn submitted his resignation hours after Trump, through a spokesman, pointedly declined to publicly back Flynn, saying he was reviewing the situation and talking to Pence. Flynn had promised Pence he had not discussed U.S. sanctions with the Russians, but transcripts of intercepted communications, described by U.S. officials, showed that the subject had come up in conversations between him and the Russian ambassador. Such contacts could potentially be in violation of a law banning private citizens from engaging in foreign policy, known as the Logan Act. Pence had defended Flynn in television interviews and was described by administration officials as upset about being misled. “Unfortunately, because of the fast pace of events, I inadvertently briefed the vice president-elect and others with incomplete information regarding my phone calls with the Russian ambassador. I have sincerely apologized to the president and the vice president, and they have accepted my apology,” Flynn said in his resignation letter. Retired General Keith Kellogg, who has been chief of staff of the White House National Security Council, was named the acting national security adviser while Trump determines who should fill the position. Kellogg, retired General David Petraeus, a former CIA director, and Robert Harward, a former deputy commander of U.S. Central Command, are under consideration for the position, a White House official said. Harward was described by officials as the leading candidate. A U.S. official confirmed a Washington Post report that Sally Yates, the then-acting U.S. attorney general, told the White House late last month that she believed Flynn had misled them about the nature of his communications with the Russian ambassador. She said Flynn might have put himself in a compromising position, possibly leaving himself vulnerable to blackmail, the official said. Yates was later fired for opposing Trump’s temporary entry ban for people from seven mostly Muslim nations. A U.S. official, describing the intercepted communications, said Flynn did not make any promises about lifting the sanctions. But he did indicate that sanctions imposed by President Barack Obama on Russia for its Ukraine incursion “would not necessarily carry over to an administration seeking to improve relations between the U.S. and Russia,” the official said. Flynn, a retired U.S. Army lieutenant general, was an early supporter of Trump and shares his interest in shaking up the establishment in Washington. He frequently raised eyebrows among Washington’s foreign policy establishment for trying to persuade Trump to warm up U.S. relations with Russia.   A U.S. official said Flynn’s departure, coupled with Russia’s aggression in Ukraine and Syria and Republican congressional opposition to removing sanctions on Russia, removes Trump’s most ardent advocate of taking a softer line toward Putin. Flynn’s leaving “may make a significant course change less likely, at least any time soon,” the official said. Another official said Flynn’s departure may strengthen the hands of some cabinet secretaries, including Defense Secretary Jim Mattis and Secretary of State Rex Tillerson. However, the second official said, Flynn’s exit could also reinforce the power of presidential aides Steve Bannon and Stephen Miller, whom he described as already having the president’s ear. Congressional Democrats expressed alarm at the developments  surrounding Flynn and called for a classified briefing by administration officials to explain what had happened. “We are communicating this request to the Department of Justice and FBI this evening,” said Democratic representatives John Conyers of Michigan and Elijah Cummings of Maryland. U.S. Representative Adam Schiff of California, ranking Democrat on the House Permanent Select Committee on Intelligence, said Flynn’s departure does not end the questions over his contacts with the Russians. “The Trump administration has yet to be forthcoming about who was aware of Flynn’s conversations with the ambassador and whether he was acting on the instructions of the president or any other officials, or with their knowledge,” Schiff said. The committee’s chairman, Republican Devin Nunes, thanked Flynn for his service. “Washington D.C. can be a rough town for honorable people, and Flynn — who has always been a soldier, not a politician —deserves America’s gratitude and respect,” he said.

The sign below reads: THE DEPLORABLES MAGA 2020Remember the artist, Shepard Fairey, whose optimistic  Hope  poster of Barack Obama went viral in 2008? There s no denying that the Fairey poster raised Obama s cool factor a few notches with the artsy LA crowd and the urban hipsters. We guess you can say that this artist is a little responsible for the  HOPELESS  8 YEAR TERM OF OBAMA SABO CRASHES OBAMA ARTIST S NEW EXHIBITION:Well, he was debuting his new exhibition,  Damaged,  Saturday night in L.A. According to HuffPost, the show is his largest to date and features printmaking, sculpture, painting, mixed media, collage, and more.For a guy who preaches against capitalism, this Obama artist sure is making lots of dough Sabo even called him out on it in a series of tweets below. Fairey is milking his Obama-fame for every last drop he can get from the liberal elitists in Hollywood.Fairey reportedly created his  We the People  series specifically to protest President Trump: The state of our society is damaged,  Fairey stated at a press preview of the exhibition on Friday.  I know it sounds pretty dire, but acknowledging that we need to do better is the first step. Sabo, for one, believes Fairey needs to do better . MINE WAS THE ONLY REAL PUNK ART THERE,  the street artist proclaimed on Twitter Sunday. He added that his MAGA flag was taken down after about 30 minutes.  SABO SAD,  he said.  MAGA   MAKE AMERICA GREAT AGAIN!!! Sabo also tweeted:  THERE WERE SO MANY D***** BAGS AT THE SHEPARD FAIREY SHOW LAST NIGHT. IF YOU HAD DROPPED A BOMB ON THE SHOW 3/4 OF THE YOUNG D***** BAGS IN LA WOULD HAVE BEEN KILLED. Fairey, a critic of the  underpinnings of the capitalist machine,  admitted to capitalizing off of his art.  I critique capitalism   yes, I am selling prints, but yes I am also giving some away,  he said at a press event Friday.Via: PJMedia ',\n",
       " 'BRUSSELS (Reuters) - European Council President Donald Tusk said he would meet with British Prime Minister Theresa May in London next Tuesday to discuss Brexit, days after she is due to make a keynote speech on her vision for future ties with the EU. He made the comment in a tweet after meeting May at the United Nations General Assembly. The London meeting between the pair will come at a sensitive time - just after her speech in Florence on Friday and before an EU heads of state dinner on Sept. 28 in Tallinn, Estonia. The Financial Times said May s top EU adviser has told his counterparts in several European that she would in Florence offer to fill a post-Brexit EU budget hole of at least 20 billion euros. The newspaper cited officials briefed on the discussions. Senior EU officials have given talk of such offers short shrift. They have dismissed suggestions floated in British media that an offer of up to 30 billion euros payable during a transition period after Brexit would be acceptable to Brussels.  It could not be, they have said, an alternative to the 60 billion or so that the EU executive has estimated may be payable before Brexit in March 2019. Brussels negotiators acknowledge privately that it may help the British government  sell  its settlement to domestic voters if London can meld the exit payments with transition payments to reduce the headline  divorce bill . EU officials told Reuters there would be no discussion of Brexit at the Tallinn dinner but that May might take the opportunity to brief the bloc s other 27 leaders on her position. Talks on Brexit have made little progress and deepened rifts in May s party, setting up the Florence speech as a chance to put negotiations back on track and reassert her authority. While Tusk is coordinating the 27 EU leaders on Brexit, only Michel Barnier is negotiating with the British and they have made clear to London that he is the only point of contact for Brexit talks. Barnier s negotiating directives have frustrated his British counterparts, who want to move the talks from divorce issues such as the EU departure bill and Irish border to future relations. Barnier first wants to see progress on the terms of Britain s exit. ',\n",
       " 'ABOARD AIR FORCE ONE (Reuters) - President Donald Trump will not announce a decision on Monday on whether he will again delay moving the U.S. embassy in Israel to Jerusalem, a White House spokesman said, despite Monday s deadline for doing so. An announcement on the decision will be made  in coming days,  White House spokesman Hogan Gidley told reporters aboard Air Force One as Trump was returning from a trip to Utah. Trump had been due to decide whether to sign a waiver that would hold off relocating the embassy from Tel Aviv for another six months, as every U.S. president has done since Congress passed a law on the issue in 1995. Senior U.S. officials have said that Trump is expected to issue a temporary order, the second since he took office, to delay moving the embassy despite his campaign pledge to go ahead with the controversial action. But the officials have said Trump is likely to give a speech on Wednesday unilaterally recognizing Jerusalem as Israel s capital, a step that would break with decades of U.S. policy and could fuel violence in the Middle East. They have said, however, that no final decisions have been made.  The president has been clear on this issue from the get-go; that it s not a matter of if, but a matter of when,  Gidley said. The Palestinians want East Jerusalem as the capital of their future state, and the international community does not recognize Israel s claim on all of the city, home to sites holy to the Jewish, Muslim and Christian religions.

       " 'During his bizarre  rally  in Youngstown, Ohio, Donald Trump did what he does best: Campaign for a position he already holds. It s become a distressingly common occurrence to see Trump holding giant gatherings that seem to serve no purpose other than to gather crowds of his supporters together in one place. He doesn t generally issue any policy proclamations, but when he does, they are invariably of the sort specifically tooled to please his rabid supporters.No matter what he says, though, it s going to get ironic. Take Youngstown. At the opening of the rally, after his supporters finished chanting  CNN SUCKS!  over and over, Trump had a question for the crowd: Is there any place that s more fun, more exciting, and safer than a Trump rally? I m sure that was reassuring for the protesters in attendance. There are always a few, although I can scarcely fathom how they can stand to be in a room with all that bigotry and hatred. I have no idea how many anti-Trump protesters were in the crowd in Youngstown, but I know this kid was there:Idiotic protester at Trump Rally in Youngstown Ohio gets dealt with ????? pic.twitter.com/IzhBdVCqHh    4  ?? (@Obielicious) July 26, 2017That actually doesn t look safe at all. That looks, in fact, like a goddamn nightmare for the young man, who was forcibly removed from the rally after standing silently with an old Soviet flag. Who knows if his protest even lodged with the president or the crowd   that s not the flag of Russia, with whom Trump colluded to corrupt our democracy, it s a communist flag. A different meaning entirely. Note how the crowd s cheering goes up ten decibels as soon as security applied his giant hands to the teenager s throat. Safe.Three days later, Trump was in front of another crowd, this time police officers. I wonder if he had the incident with this kid in mind when he told the cops in attendance to not  be too nice  in dealing with suspects. It could be he was thinking of the red flag with the hammer and sickle that triggered him in Ohio, or maybe he was thinking about the former police chief there in Suffolk County where he was speaking   the chief that s serving just under 4 years for beating a suspect almost to death.The reckless tone the president takes when he speaks is more than carelessness or a lack of empathy. It s dangerous. All of the world leaders that Trump looks up to   Putin, Duterte, Erdogan   are of the sort that have their detractors silenced, arrested, or even murdered. How long will it be until his supporters call for the same actions from their hero Trump?This Twitter user laughed until he cried about the violent removal.We know they already condone it.Featured image via Justin Merriman/Getty Images',\n",
